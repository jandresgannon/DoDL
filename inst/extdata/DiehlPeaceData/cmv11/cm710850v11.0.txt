This dispute involves 2 incidents- an Indonesian naval exercise near the Natuna Islands and the dispatch of 5 warships to the area by China in response to the exercise. The Indonesian exercise was, according to reports, "intended to warn Beijing that Jakarta will strongly resist any Chinese attempt to assert control over a huge natural gas project being developed by Indonesian and US companies." China renounced its claims on the Natunas in 1995, but not the gas field.
