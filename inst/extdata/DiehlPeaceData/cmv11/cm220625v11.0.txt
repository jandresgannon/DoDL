DISPLAY OF FORCE 

On April 29, 2004, Janjaweed militia forces from Sudan crossed into Chad and attacked a village, raiding cattle. As they were retreating to Sudanese territory, Chadian military forces caught them and engaged in a firefight with the group. At that time, Sudanese military forces crossed over into Chadian territory and entered into the clash, giving the Janjaweed fighters time to retreat into Sudanese territory. Following several more incursions into Chadian territory by Janjaweed fighters from Sudan, France deployed 200 soldiers already stationed in Chad to the border between the two countries to help protect the territorial integrity of Chad. First day of dispute was on 7/30/2004 and last day of dispute was on 1/30/2005.
