CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1733 After a military coup, communist insurrections/rebellions occurred against the new military government. These involved organized, militarized violence and caused the major states to worry about their interests in El Salvador. At the UKs request, Canada sent two warships to protect British interests, but the military government put down the insurrection/rebellion before the ships arrived (Gibler 2018).
