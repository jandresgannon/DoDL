TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3617 from Gibler 2018, in 1984 Iran attacked two Saudi oil tankers in the Persian Gulf that it suspected of carrying oil from Iraq. Iran routinely attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil during the Iran-Iraq War as a means of harming Iraq's economy. Iran also threatened other Gulf states that it would use force to shut down the Persian Gulf if Iraq did not stop its attacks on Iran. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute.
