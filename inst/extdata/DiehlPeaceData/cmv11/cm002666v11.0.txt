PS: 19480514-19670504 0.5 19670505-20209999 0.75

PS-UPDATE2020: Although this case does not meet the standard criteria for a relationship, it is counted as an exception to the criteria given the close US-Israel ties in political, economic, and military realms. It is a strong patron-client relationship, similar to USSR-Cuba, that is non-colonial and between states that are not geographically proximate.

PSNOTES: The depth of the US-Israel alliance throughout the 20th century seems to deserve a 0.75. This alliance was significantly increased during Lyndon Johnson's presidency and it entered the world stage during the Six Days War in 1967.
