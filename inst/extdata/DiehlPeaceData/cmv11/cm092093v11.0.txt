CIVWARMID-CER: MID1202 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1202 from cm narrative, Nicaragua and El Salvador (among other Central American states) supported insurgencies in each other's country in an attempt to overthrow the regime and bring a friendlier regime to power. This era is marked by the Central American states and insurgencies feuding along conservative-liberal lines. Here, Nicaragua was supporting liberal rebels in El Salvador to try to bring a liberal regime to power, and El Salvador was supporting conservative rebels in Nicaragua to oust the liberal regime of Zelaya. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved militarized rebel groups in both countries of this dyad. 

CIVWARLINK: MID1202 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1202 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1202 From cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID triggered by Central American states supporting insurgencies in other Central American states. In this MID, Guatemala and Honduras were also supporting a conservative insurgency in Nicaragua, and Nicaragua was supporting liberal insurgencies in those countries. Coded civil war link because Guatemala and Honduras are outside of this dyad.

In an ongoing territorial waters dispute over fishing rights in the Gulf of Fonseca, a Salvadoran naval force seized a Nicaraguan boat on March 7, 1997 for fishing in waters claimed by El Salvador. The Nicaraguan navy sent a boat to rescue the seized fishing boat but due to a mechanical problem the navy boat sank on the route, killing all six occupants. It was not clear what happened to the seized fishing boat. First day of dispute was on 3/7/1997 and last day of dispute was on 3/00/1997.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Nicaragua and El Salvador engaged in military hostilities from February 19 to April 23, 1907, resulting in the deaths of some 400 Nicaraguan soldiers and 300 Salvadoran soldiers. The United States and Mexico mediated the signing of a ceasefire agreement in Amapala on April 23, 1907. The United States and Mexico facilitated negotiations between representatives from El Salvador and Nicaragua in Washington DC from September 17 to December 20, 1907. The countries signed a peace agreement in Washington DC on December 20, 1907. El Salvador filed a complaint against Nicaragua with the *Central American Court of Justice* (CACJ) on August 28, 1916, which suggested that the *Bryan- Chamorro Convention* signed by the United States and Nicaragua on August 5, 1914 violated El Salvador's rights in the Gulf of Fonseca. The CACJ ruled on March 9, 1917 that the treaty did violate El Salvador's rights in the Gulf of Fonseca. Nicaragua formally rejected the ruling on March 10, 1917.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between El Salvador and Nicaragua resulted from the contagion effect of the Nicaraguan-Honduran rivalry and a larger Central American war between liberals and conservatives. In 1907, El Salvadorean forces joined with Honduran, Guatemalan and exiled Nicaraguan conservative forces to force the liberal Jose Zelaya of Nicaragua out of power. Zelaya in return supported liberal forces in El Salvador in an effort to secure an eventual union of like-minded ideologies between Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua (MID1202 on1/5/07, MID1203 on 3/1/09 and MID1204 on 6/11/07). As early as September 1907, the United States and Mexico attempted to mediate the larger conflict in Washington, DC. The mediations produced several treaties providing for obligating the countries to mutual non-intervention and for non-recognition of governments born out of revolution. The rivalry effectively ends not because of the mediation but because of Zelaya's fall from power in a rebellion launhed by Juan Estrada, a Nicaraguan conservative. Estrada it should be mentioned, was backed by several US businesses based in Nicaragua, along with Estrada Cabrera, the conservative president of Guatemala. While the rebellion had difficulty succeeding, the intervention of the US marines in 1910 and subsequent US occupation kept the conservatives in power. Thus, the issue in the rivalry between El Salvador and Nicaragua, Zelaya's liberal regime, was removed.
