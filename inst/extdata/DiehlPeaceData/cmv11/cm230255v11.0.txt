NARRATIVE-CM:
A German submarine sank the Norwegian ship *Tiger* off the coast of Spain on May 7, 1917 during the *First World War*. Spain accused Germany of violating international law by sinking a neutral vessel in Spanish territorial waters. The countries agreed to submit the dispute to an ad hoc commission of inquiry based on Article 9 of the 1899 *Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes*. The three-member commission of inquiry (Spain, Germany, Denmark), which was assisted by four staff personnel, met from November 1 to November 8, 1918. The commission of inquiry found that, while the *Tiger* had been seized within Spain's territorial waters, the ship was sunk outside those waters. Germany was required to pay damages. Spain protested against Germany's military assistance to nationalist rebels on September 15, 1936. Germany recognized the nationalist government headed by General Francisco Franco on November 18, 1936. Spain referred the matter of German intervention in the Spanish civil war to the *League of Nations* (LON) Council on November 27, 1936. The LON Council discussed the dispute on December 10-12, 1936. Spanish naval ships seized the German ship *Palos* on December 26, 1936. Spain announced its neutrality in the *Second World War* on September 3, 1939. In December 1940, Germany informed the Spanish government that would deploy German troops in Spain in January 1940. A few days later, Germany announced that it would not deploy troops in Spain. Spain severed diplomatic relations with Germany on May 8, 1945.
