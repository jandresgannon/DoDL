South Africa (along with Zimbabwe and Botswana) urged the reinstatement of the Prime Minister (8/25/94). During 9/7-9/9/94, South Africa takes escalatory action against Lesotho, including (repeatedly) massing troops at the border, threatening blockade, and flying fighters over a Lesotho military base.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Lesotho supported the anti-apartheid *African National Congress* (ANC) and provided a safe haven for South African political refugees in the late-1970s. South Africa began supporting *Lesotho Liberation Army* (LLA), which sought to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, in May 1979. The LLA established bases in South Africa and launched several attacks against Lesotho from these bases. South African troops attacked ANC targets in Maseru, Lesotho on December 9, 1982, resulting in the deaths of 42 individuals. Prime Minister Jonathan of Lesotho protested the attack, and referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council on December 10, 1982. The UN General Assembly condemned South Africa on December 14, 1982, and the UN Security Council condemned South Africa on December 15, 1982. The South African foreign minister formally rejected the UN Security Council condemnation on February 9, 1983. *Non-Aligned Movement* (NAM) heads of state condemned South Africa's aggression against Lesotho and expressed support for Lesotho on March 12, 1983. The *Organization of African Unity *(OAU) heads-of-state condemned the South African blockade of Lesotho on June 12, 1983. SADF troops attacked ANC targets in Maseru on December 20, 1985, resulting in the deaths of nine individuals. UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar condemned South African aggression against Lesotho on December 20, 1985. Lesotho referred the matter to the UN Security Council on December 23, 1985. The UN Security Council condemned South Africa's aggression against Lesotho on December 30, 1985. South Africa imposed a blockade of Lesotho on January 1, 1986. Lesotho referred the matter to the UN Security Council on January 14, 1986. UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appointed Rune Wrangdahl of Sweden as special representative to Lesotho on January 17, 1986. Prime Minister Jonathan was deposed in a military coup led by General Lekhanya on January 20, 1986, and General Lekhanya ended Lesotho's support for the ANC on January 21, 1986. South Africa lifted the blockade of Lesotho on January 25, 1986.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Lesotho supported the anti-apartheid *African National Congress* (ANC) and provided a safe haven for South African political refugees in the late-1970s. South Africa began supporting *Lesotho Liberation Army* (LLA), which sought to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan, in May 1979. The LLA established bases in South Africa and launched several attacks against Lesotho from these bases. Much like other rivalries in which South Africa was involved during this period, these factors were the main causes.

South African troops attacked ANC targets in Maseru, Lesotho on December 9, 1982, resulting in the deaths of 42 individuals. This was MID3073.

SADF troops attacked ANC targets in Maseru on December 20, 1985, resulting in the deaths of nine individuals. 

South Africa imposed a blockade of Lesotho on January 1, 1986. South Africa lifted the blockade of Lesotho on January 25, 1986.

The late 1980s brought about dramatic changes in the South African government, which changed the nature of relations between the two states. In 1989, Pretoria abandoned its policy of regional destabilization, which lessened the strains between the two countries. The ANC as well as 59 other previously illegal organizations were legalized on February 2, 1990. Over the next several months, the South African government saw the institution of a new constitution and an end to apartheid. Nelson Mandela, who had been a prisoner for nearly 30 years for his leadership in opposition to the South African government, was freed and became president. 

Because of these changes in the domestic system of South Africa, the basis for this rivalry ended. 

Another rivalry is listed between the two countries though, beginning in 1994. During this year, there are two MIDs listed, although there are none listed afterward.

In 1994, the king of Lesotho ousted the elected government, but agreed due to threats of imposed sanctions by President Mandela of South Africa to reinstate democracy. However, he was opposed in this by his military. This is MID4162. COW narrative: MID4162 Lesotho's king Lutsie III ousted Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhekle (8/17/94) with force. South Africa (along with Zimbabwe and Botswana) urged the reinstatement of the Prime Minister (8/25/94). During 9/7-9/9/94, South Africa takes escalatory action against Lesotho, including (repeatedly) massing troops at the border, threatening blockade, and flying fighters over a Lesotho military base. Lesotho responds by fortifying its border. 

I was unable to find information on the one day MID4237 on December 16, 1994, and I am not sure anyway that this rises to the level of an actual rivalry between the two countries considering no disputes have occurred since. COW narrative is: MID4237 Lesotho reinforces its border by deploying troops to maintain security. Lesotho accuses South African farmers of stealing cattle in Lesotho with the help of South African army members. South Africa denies any involvement.
