MID254 

TERRMID: MID254 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID254 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID254 from cm narrative, this MID was triggered by the US deterring Italy from intervening in Venezuela. This was during the Venezuelan debt crisis in 1902-1903, and Venezuela had defaulted on payments to Italy. The US intervened per the values of the Monroe Doctrine, which was common practice during this time period. Coded not territorial because it was an economic issue that created the Italy-Venezuela tension and the US and Italy were not disputing territory.

PSNOTES: 

The Armistice of Cassibile was an armistice signed on 3 September 1943 by Walter Bedell Smith and Giuseppe Castellano, and made public on 8 September, between the Kingdom of Italy and the Allies ("United Nations") of World War II. It was signed at a conference of generals from both sides in an Allied military camp at Cassibile in Sicily, which had recently been occupied by the Allies. The armistice was approved by both King Victor Emmanuel III and Italian Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio. The armistice stipulated in fact the surrender of Italy to the Allies.

RIVNOTES: 

MID254 is the Venezuelan Debt Crisis which occurred from July of 1902 until February of 1903. The South American nation of Venezuela became deeply indebted to several European states in the early years of the 20th century. The debt's amount was open to legitimate debate, but little effort had been made to resolve the dispute or establish meaningful repayment.
