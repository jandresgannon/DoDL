PS-UPDATE2020: Revision based on a new relationship rule that when a state exits a REI, the REI is the only basis for a relationship with a given other state, and the peace scale coding is not .5, then the relationship continues for 5 years and is coded as negative peace (.5) and then the relationship ends thereafter.
Modified here as the relationship ends with the breakup of Czechoslovakia

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID346 from Gibler 2018, Czechoslovakia threatened to walk out of the World Communist meeting in Budapest in 1968 if Russia did not stop interfering in Czech international affairs. Czechoslovakia's leader had been embracing a more international position, which worried communists in the Soviet Union and in other Soviet-controlled/allied states (including Bulgaria here). The Soviets had been supporting the opposition political party in Czechoslovakia who held a more hard-line, pro-Soviet stance. In June 1968, the opposition party lost in the parliamentary elections, and Soviet tanks arrived in Czechoslovakia and soon thereafter detained the Czech leader. In November, the Soviets forced Czechoslovakia to reorganize their regime and become more closely aligned with Soviet communism. Coded not third party link to territory because although this MID involved Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, this was a regime type issue, not a territorial issue, as the Soviets were ensuring a friendly regime remained in place. Bulgaria is pulled in here due to its alliance with and diplomatic support for Russia.
