TERRMID-NOTES: MID4474 from Gibler 2018, in 2005-2006 Bhutan protested when China entered its territory and built roads and bridges. China claimed it was encouraging economic development and did not dispute that it was Bhutan's territory. Coded not territory because they were not disputing a boundary.

MID200 Chinese troops entered Bhutan and began constructing roads and bridges. Bhutan declared the intrusion a violation of its territorial sovereignty, while China stated that the troops were there peacefully providing economic development for both Bhutan and western China. First day of dispute was on 11/00/2005 and last day of dispute was on 5/00/2006.

REFERENCE TO MID200 IS INCORRECT AT IT REFERS TO A MID IN THE 1950s AND NOT INVOLVING CHINA OR BHUTAN
