NARRATIVE-CR:
Argentina and the United Kingdom have two separate periods of militarized rivalry involving different substantive issues. The first involved interventions by the United Kingdom in an effort to protect economic interests in the 19th century. The second involved the dispute over the Falklands/Malvinas islands. In between these two periods of rivalry there are two disputes that seem to be isolated and not involving either of the two rivalry issues.

In 1947 and 1948, two disputes involved early claims over islands near the Antarctic prior to the Treaty of Antarctica in 1959. Chile, Argentina and the United Kingdom disputed claims to Graham Land, a group of Antarctic islands in 1947, each sending naval expeditionary forces to stake claim to the island from February to April 1947, MID1698. In January 1948, the three countries ordered naval and army units to the area in an effort to demonstrate a show of force to back up claims to the Antarctic regions, MID2840.

In the 19th century, the rivalry between Argentina and the United Kingdom was largely due to British intervention in Argentinian affairs, brought about by its need to protect economic interests in the region. This protection was necessary largely due to the foreign policy of Argentinian dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas who sought to consolidate and expand Argentina's power internally and in neighboring Uruguay.

In Uruguay, Rosas' ally, President Manuel Oribe had been ousted from power by Fructuoso Rivera with assistance by General Lavalle, a rival of Rosas. With French support, Lavalle also had initiated a rebellion against Rosas in Argentina. The rebellion in Argentina failed by 1841 but led to a series of terror campaigns by the Rosas' administration. In January 1842, France and Great Britain sent naval ships to Argentina to monitor these terror campaigns and protect their citizens against possible attacks, MID371. Oribe, did assist Rosas in defeating the rebellion and his efforts led to an opportunity to take back power in Uruguay by 1843. Rosas and Oribe together began a siege on Montevideo in 1843 to accomplish this task, imposing a blockade on the city as well.

This siege on Montevideo led to both French and British intervention to break the blockade in 1843 (MID2055). In addition, the British and French began naval operations to open all Argentine and Uruguayan rivers to free navigation. In September 1845, both French and naval forces imposed a blockade on Buenos Aires (MID123). Both naval efforts failed, leaving Rosas even more powerful by 1846 when the blockade ended. This status for Rosas was very temporary, however, as pro-European groups within Buenos Aires in addition to provencial adversaries began rebelling against his regime. Justo Urquiza, a rival caudillo, led the revolt against Rosas which proved successful by 1852. Thus, a new regime was implemented that was sympathetic to European interests.

After Rosas' fall, the new regime began economic reform, stipulating its policy of economic liberalism in its new constitution written in 1853. This constitution also provided for presidential elections the same year which Urquiza won. Immediately Urquiza signed commerical treaties were with France, Great Britain and the United States and began encouraging foreign investment. Additionally Urquiza opened up Argentine rivers to free navigation for foreign trade. These policies led to expansion of British commerical ventures such as railroad building and exploration of the Chaco. This regime change then seem to end the first rivalry between Great Britain and Argentina due to the new regime's openness to British economic interests which had been the cause of initial British intervention in the country. It should be noted, however, that Urquiza lost power after a civil conflict with rival Bartolome Miter in 1861. Instability again led to civil conflict in 1880, resulting in another need for the British navy to enter Argentina, MID1763. After 1880, Argentine political affairs did not further threaten foreign commerical interests. Instead Argentina strengthened its relations with Europe both politically, socially and economically.

The rivalry between Argentina and the United Kingdom in the 20th century is over the sovereign rights to the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Ownership of the islands has been in dispute by Argentina since the British took control of them in 1833. The MIDs that characterize the rivalry take place within a relatively short period of time, from 1976 to 1983 (MID363 in 1976, MID3630 and MID3077 in 1982 and MID3064 in 1983) with the height of the dispute culminating in the Falkland/Malvinas War that began on March 1, 1982 (MID3630).

On the Argentine side, the dispute over the Malvinas is one of many territorial disputes Argentina had with its neighbors, particularly Chile. The invasion of the Falklands is generally attributed to the presence of a military government in Argentina that needed a nationalist diversion in the midst of domestic troubles. President Alfonsin's election in October 1983, restored democracy to the country after governance by military junta. Immediately efforts were made by Britain to restore relations with the new government, excluding discussions of sovereignty over the Falklands. In February 1984, President Alfonsin suggested that negotiations on sovereignty be resumed under the auspices of the United Nations, suggesting that while the Argentine position on the Malvinas did not change, the possibilities of resorting to force did seem to decrease with a democratically elected government. This claim is also substantiated by the Argentine pursuit of peaceful negotiations over the Beagle Channel islands dispute with Chile during the same period.

From the British perspective, the Argentine threat appears to be unlikely. Shortly after the war, measures were taken to deter any further militarized incidents. In May 1985, the British secured their commitment to protecting the island by building an all-weather airport designed to allow a permanent capability to rapidly deploy forces in the event of aggressive Argentine action. Added to the permanent garrison the British provided to the island immediately after the war, these two factors certainly presented a much more difficult decision to any government in Argentina contemplating further militarized actions in an effort to resolve the dispute.

Aside from the issues of democratization and British deterence, Argentina would be unlikely to pursue further militarized conflict due to the domestic concerns of its economy along with improved relations with the United Kingdom in all other areas. In terms of its economy, President Alfonsin's administration in 1983 was immediately hit with an economic crisis where the GDP of the country was the same as its GDP in 1974. In addition, the Argentine economy had one of the highest percentages of inflation in the world and was highly in debt. Plans to turn the economy around were unsuccessful in the short term, leading to general strikes by Argentine trade unions in 1985. By the end of 1985, however, the government was able to secure moderate successes with an increase in production and private investment. These successes were trumped by larger failures that resulted in the refusal of the IMF and World Bank to issue more credits to Argentina and the use of most of Argentina's foreign currency reserve by February 1989. These economic conditions destabilized the banking system and consumer prices, leading to food riots in May 1989, growing social disturbances and hyperinflation. Amid these growing concerns, Carlos Menem was elected to the presidency on May 14, 1989. Alfonsin resigned early in July 1989 although he was not due to leave office until December. Under the Menem administration, structural reforms were put in place to quell the crisis and while these achieved limited success, the economy still commanded most of the administration's and country's attention. In 1991, Menem joined with Brazil, Parguay, and Uruguay to form Mercosur, which established a common market between the four countries. The remainder of Menem's administration was relatively stable although the economy continued to be a difficult area to bring under control. In December 1999, Fernando de la Rua began his term as the next elected president of Argentina. Similar to the other presidents before him, de la Rua was forced to focus on economic issues due to continued inflation, debt, and capital flight. In only two years, de la Rua's administration found itself unable to control the economy, leading to riots in protest against increasingly declining economic situations. Unemployment was at 18.3% and the government was facing the possibility of defaulting on its $US 132 billion foreign debt. On December 5, 2001 the IMF froze its loan installment to Argentina. Riots on December 19, 2001 led to over 20 deaths and widespread looting. On December 19, 2001 de la Rua was forced to declare a state of seige to end the rioting. On December 20, 2001 de la Rua resigned from office leaving the National Congress to select President Eduardo Duhalde on January 2, 2002 to take the office. On January 3, 2002 Argentina defaulted on its international loans from the World Bank. On January 15, 2003 Argentina failed to make payment on its loan from the Inter-American Development Bank. On January 16, 2003 Argentina and the IMF reached an agreement that allowed the country to avoid defaulting on its loans. The IMF was the only major creditor with which it had not gone into default. In sum, Argentina lacked the resources to realistically pursue a militarized dispute over the Falklands with the UK even if the desire was there to do so.

After the militarized conflict between the two ended, several years of constant accusations of sovereignty violations were the norm with regard to the relations between the two countries. Upon his inauguration in 1989, Argentine President Carlos Menem immediately tried to get each side to discuss normalizing relations while at the same time expressing a pledge to recover the Malvinas for Argentina. Meetings between the two countries occured in August 1989 in New York and October in Madrid. On February 19, 1990 the two countries agreed to resume diplomatic and full economic relations, further claiming that all hostilities between them no longer existed. This action facilitated discussion on economic cooperation between the two countries with regard to fisheries, communications and energy source exploration in the area. While relations have been restored, the question over sovereignty remains an issue. Public opinion in both Argentina and the United Kingdom is strongly against formally handing over the island to either side, making it a potentially difficult political problem for the two countries to enter into negotiations over sovereignty. Although this makes resolution of the dispute unlikely for the immediate future, the Menem government did acknowledge in 1990 that a resort to force was a mistake in 1982 and that only a peaceful solution was appropriate. On August 27, 1998 Carlos Menem visited the United Kingdom. This was the first official visit by an Argentine leader since 1960. The trip was an effort to further strengthen relations between the two countries. During his visit Menem reasserted the Argentine claim to the Falklands but pledged that the country would never again resort to force to gain control over the islands. On July 14, 1999 the two governments agreed to reinstate Argentine flights between the Falklands and Argentina for the first time since 1982. In Britain, the issue seems to be one where the status quo is preferred compared to any formal changes. Since the end of the war, a lack of Argentine aggression and a dramatic drop in defense spending have seemingly made the issue much less important for the British to formally resolve. The Argentine acknowledgment and British content with the status quo suggests that in terms of militarized conflict the dispute and thus the rivalry has reached a conclusion.

In 1943 UK suggested to Argentina to bring the dispute over the islands near the Antarctic in front of the International Court of Justice. Argentine refuses this proposal in 1948 and then again in 1951 and 1953. In 1954 UK suggests to set up an ad hoc tribunal to deal with these issues. On September 17, 1946 a trade agreement was negotiated between the two countries. In 1947 and 1948, two disputes involved early claims over islands near the Antarctic prior to the Treaty of Antarctica in 1959. Chile, Argentina and the United Kingdom disputed claims to Graham Land, a group of Antarctic islands in 1947, each sending naval expeditionary forces to stake claim to the island from February to April 1947, MID1698. In January 1948, the three countries ordered naval and army units to the area in an effort to demonstrate a show of force to back up claims to the Antarctic regions, MID2840. On May 4, 1955 UK brings the issue in front of the International Court of Justice. The *United Nations *(UN) General Assembly appealed for peaceful negotiations on December 16, 1965. Argentina and Britain held negotiations in London beginning on July 18, 1966. Argentina and Britain signed travel and communications agreements improving the links between Argentina and the Falkland Islands on July 1, 1971. In April 1973 Britain refused to negotiate the question of sovereignty, arguing that it cannot give up the islands without the consent of the inhabitants. The negotiations ceased. The UN General Assembly appealed for peaceful negotiations on December 14, 1973. From 1965 to 1975 there were three attempted invasions of the Malvines/Falklands Islands from Argentina, none of them sanctioned directly by the government, but rather privately financed. In October 1975 a mission is sent by Britain to investigate the possibilities of exploiting the natural resources of the Falklands. Argentina protests declaring that it has not given official permission. In January 1976 Argentina and Britain withdraw their ambassadors to London and respectively, Buenos Aires.

Argentina and Britain held bilateral negotiations in Madrid from October 17-19, 1989, and an agreement was reached to formally end hostilities and to resume consular relations. On February 15, 1990 the two countries agreed to resume diplomatic and full economic relations, further claiming that all hostilities between them no longer existed. This action facilitated discussion on economic cooperation between the two countries with regard to fisheries, communications and energy source exploration in the area. While relations have been restored, the question over sovereignty remains an issue. Public opinion in both Argentina and the United Kingdom is strongly against formally handing over the island to either side, making it a potentially difficult political problem for the two countries to enter into negotiations over sovereignty. Although this makes resolution of the dispute unlikely for the immediate future, the Menem government did acknowledge in 1990 that a resort to force was a mistake in 1982 and that only a peaceful solution was appropriate. In various statements on March 1st, 1991 and then again in 1992 and 1993 the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs made it clear that Argentina considers the recovery of the South Atlantic islands through peaceful means a foreign policy priority.

In 1993 there were diplomatic exchanges over the fishing rights around the islands under dispute. In September 1995, Argentina and UK signed an agreement regarding the extraction of oil near the Falklands/Malvines Islands under dispute. Under the agreement, Britain would obtain 66.6 percent of earnings on any oil or gas discovered in waters to the east of the Falklands, and that Argentina would receive 33.3 percent of the remaining earnings.

In 1997 a treaty of cooperation in the fields of oil extraction and fishing was signed between the two countries. On August 27, 1998 Carlos Menem visited the United Kingdom. This was the first official visit by an Argentine leader since 1960. The trip was an effort to further strengthen relations between the two countries. During his visit Menem reasserted the Argentine claim to the Falklands but pledged that the country would never again resort to force to gain control over the islands. However, the business relations between the two countries strengthen during the visit. Secondly, UK lifted the arms embargo set on Argentina. On July 14, 1999 the two governments agreed to reinstate Argentine flights between the Falklands and Argentina for the first time since 1982 and allowed Argentines to come on Falkland Islands. In November 1999 joint military exercises were held by the two nations in South Atlantic. In 2001, Tony Blair became the first British Prime Minister to make an official visit to Buenos Aires. In March 2002, during a visit by British Defense Secretary Geoffrey Hoon to Argentina, the two countries agreed to enhance military cooperation and to continue their close joint work in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Cyprus. In late 2003 Argentina banned flights to the Falklands/Malvines Islands, over its territory, until Britain allows Argentine carriers to fly there, too. In 2006, Argentina has given a warning of "a drastic change" in its quest for sovereignty over the Falklands. It has also accused Britain of bad faith for failing to enter substantive talks on the future of the islands over which the two countries went to war 24 years ago. In 2007, on the anniversary of 25 years since the war over the Falklands/Malvines Islands, the Argentine Vice-President, Daniel Scioli, said that Argentina hopes to regain the islands through peaceful, diplomatic channels. In January 2007, In January, Kirchner sent Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana to lobby U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to support new sovereignty talks. Taiana said that Argentina would continue pressing "in all international forums for our rights." In Britain, the issue seems to be one where the status quo is preferred compared to any formal changes. Since the end of the war, a lack of Argentine aggression and a dramatic drop in defense spending have seemingly made the issue much less important for the British to formally resolve. The Argentine acknowledgment and British content with the status quo suggests that in terms of militarized conflict, the possibility of a dispute is inexistent. However, even though only a negotiated peaceful resolution of the issue is envisioned, the issue of conflict, over the sovereignty of Falklands/Malvines Islands is not solved yet.
