MID254 

TERRMID: MID254 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID254 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID254 from cm narrative, this MID was triggered by the US deterring Italy from intervening in Venezuela. This was during the Venezuelan debt crisis in 1902-1903, and Venezuela had defaulted on payments to Italy. The US intervened per the values of the Monroe Doctrine, which was common practice during this time period. Coded not territorial because it was an economic issue that created the Italy-Venezuela tension and the Venezuela and Italy were not disputing territory.
