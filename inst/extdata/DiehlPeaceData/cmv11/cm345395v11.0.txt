TERRLINK-CER: MID4137 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of "protecting" the ethnic Serbs there.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 6/11/1998 and last day of dispute was on 6/10/1999.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat.

RIV916 is considered an isolated rivalry because all the MIDs are part of one war.
RIV916: MID4186, this MID has been broken up into two MID4186 & MID4343 because the incidents were more than 6 months apart in mid3.02

NARRATIVE-CM:
MID4137 In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia.

Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy.

MID4186 This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. 

MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

PS-NARRATIVE: 

The diplomatic relations between Serbia and Iceland are regulated through their embassies in Stockholm, Sweden. There are no permanent embassies in Reykavik and Belgrade. The relations during the Cold War were established in the context of Iceland as a member of NATO and Yugoslavia as a leader of the non-aligned movement. There was no specific contact between the leaders of the two countries for the period, except in the context of United Nations or European conferences. 

Iceland extended diplomatic recognition to Croatia and Slovenia on December 19, 1991, becoming the first Western nation to accept the two breakaway Yugoslav republics as independent states. Gudmundur Eiriksson, legal adviser to Iceland's Foreign Ministry, said Iceland wanted to establish diplomatic relations with Croatia and Slovenia as soon as possible. "The governments of Croatia and Slovenia have pledged and made certain assurances that they would be complying with provisions sought by various European states concerning the respect of human rights in their countries," Eiriksson said.

The first MID of RIV916, MID4137 started on March 9th, 1998 with NATO air strikes against Yugoslavian forces in Kosovo. 

The last MID of RIV916, MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said.

AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces. With the end of the NATO-Yugoslavian conflict, the Icelandic-Yugoslavia rivalry also ended. 

The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is reportedly due to sign a trade co-operation declaration with Yugoslavia on December 12, 2000. The declaration is expected to be signed at the end of a ministerial meeting in Geneva by Yugoslavia's Transport Minister Zoran Sami, reported Reuters. The declaration will reportedly go into force immediately and is expected to be followed with more detailed negotiations on a wider pact early next year. The declaration will also have an impact on the four-nation trade association EFTA comprises Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Iceland said on June 8, 2006, that it recognized Montenegro as an independent and sovereign country, making itself the first country to make the recognition after Montenegro's declaration of independence last weekend. In a letter to Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Vlahovic, Iceland's Foreign Minister Geir Haarde said he "is honored to inform you on behalf of the Iceland government that Iceland recognizes Montenegro as an independent and sovereign country." Haarde said that Iceland was ready to establish formal diplomatic ties with Montenegro, while conveying congratulations on Montenegro's independence from the state union of Serbia-Montenegro.
