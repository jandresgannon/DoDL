This is a continuation of MID4282 and continues to be caused by ongoing disputes between North and South Korea over the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea and the DMZ between the two countries. At the NLL, North Korea repeatedly sent ships into South Korean waters, although these incursions were brief and the ships usually returned to North Korean waters folloiwng the deployment of South Korean ships to the area. At the DMZ, both North Korea and South Korea increased military defenses on their mutual border. In a few instances, the two sides exchanged machine gun fire, though this event did not result in sustained armed hostilities between the two countries. First day of dispute was on 6/2/2001 and last day of dispute was on 11/10/2004.

The impetus of this particular MID was the joint US-ROK military maneuvers in 2009, which North Korean strongly protested. However, the larger underlying issues remain the demarcation of the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea and continuing tension around the DMZ between PRK and ROK (see MID4282 and MID4481). The majority of incidents involve shows of force by North and South Korea, mostly via North Korean warships crossing over the NLL. Several threats were also made about increasing hostilities should such shows of force happen. The MID reached a height when North Korean forces shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing several soldiers and resulting in an artillery clash between the two sides. Ultimately, the hostilities between the countries subsided to their normal level of intensity. First day of dispute was on 1/17/2009 and last day of dispute was on 12/23/2010.

In the wake of continued concern over the North Korean nuclear program, the US and South Korea began conducting joint exercises. North Korea threatened in March 1993 to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and ban inspections of its nuclear facilities. As a result, the US-ROK exercises, which were cancelled in the previous year, were conducted in 1993. In response, North Korea placed its forces on alert, declaring a "semi-war footing." South Korea also declared an alert of its own. In the wake of continued concern over the North Korean nuclear program, the US and South Korea began conducting joint exercises.

This dispute involves a series of 26 incidents between November 1993 and April 1995. The primary participants in the dispute were South Korea, North Korea, and USA. Japan was the subject of a North Korean threat in March 1994 and participated in a joint naval exercise with USA, South Korea, Australia, and Canada forces in June 1994. Australian and Canadian participation in the dispute was limited to the naval exercises. During the dispute, North Korea and the AmericanSouth Korean side exchanged alerts, threats of forces and war, and shows of force. Both sides conducted border fortifications and North Korea violated the South Korean border as it challenged the Korean War armistice agreement. First day of dispute was on 11/5/1993 and last day of dispute was on 4/23/1995.

This dispute consisted of 49 incidents that occurred between 10/10/94 and 9/99. Although this is a large number of incidents over a long period of time, the longest duration between incidents was approximately 5.5 months. In addition, the pattern in which the incidents occurred suggests that they are linked and should be considered as one dispute. In the dispute, North Korea continually challenges South Korean territorial boundaries along the DMZ and in the waters along the Northern Limit Line. South Korea responds by placing its forces on alert, conducting military exercises, showing ships and planes, and clashing with North Korean vessels that cross into South Korean waters and North Korea troops that cross the DMZ. Despite the distinction between the land and naval incursions by North Korea, their timing close together suggests a broader effort to challenge South Korean borders. On 4/10/97 (incident FE00190) North Korean troops crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory. Less than 2 months later (FE00194), North Korean vessels crossed into South Korean waters and a clash between North and South Korean vessels ensued. Slightly more than one later (FE00192), on 7/10/97 North Korean troops again crossed the DMZ and another clash ensued. Furthermore, throughout this period North Korean submersibles violated both South Korean waters and land. The South Korean reaction to these incidents also suggests that they were viewed as broader challenges to South Korean territory rather than separate challenges along the DMZ. For example, as a result of the 7/16/97 clash in the DMZ, South Korea placed its forces along both the DMMMZ and Northern Limit Line on alert in incident FE00217. During the dispute the incidents of highest severity included: 12/17/94 - North Korean forces shot down an American helicopter that had strayed across the DMZ (FE00038), 5/30/95-North Korea fired at and seized a South Korean fishing vessel that had strayed into North Korean waters, 6/5/97 - A clash between North and South Korean vessels when a North Korean vessel crossed into Southern waters (FE00194), 7/16/97-A clash between North and South Korean troops when 14 North Korean troops crossed the DMZ (FE00192), 9/9/97-South Korean forces intercepted and killed a North Korean soldier that had crossed teh DMZ (FE00199), 12/18/98-A clash occurred when South Korean forces chased and fired upon a North Korean semi-submersible that had crossed into South Korean territory (FE00238), 6/15/99-A naval clash ensued when South Korean vessels rammed North Korean vessels that were violating South Korean waters (FE00268 & FE00267). Interspersed between these major actions were threats, border fortifications, alerts, and shows of force. First day of dispute was on 10/10/1994 and last day of dispute was on 9/3/1999.

This dispute is based on a series of bilateral incidents among China and Philippines, which occurred because of tensions about control over the disputed Spratly Islands by the claimant countries. In August 1998, Philippines engaged in a show of force by increasing patrols in the Spratly Islands as a result of the sighting of unspecified Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. Starting from October 28, 1998, Philippines protested against the intrusion of several armed Chinese vessels and cargo ships near a group of islands in the Spratlys. This incident is reported as China's show of force against Philippines and the end day is unclear. China was reported to be constructing structures on the area. In response to China's naval movements in the Spratlys, Philippines engaged in a counter show of force by increasing naval patrols in the area in order to prevent the entrance and exit of Chinese naval vessels (starting in November 1998). China protested the increase of Philippine patrols. On November 11, 1998, Philippines placed its forces on alert in the South China Sea in response to Chinese encroachment on one of the disputed reefs. The Philippine navy was ordered to "shoot across the bow" of any intruding Chinese ships. On November 29, 1998, Philippines arrested twenty Chinese fishermen fishing on the Spratly Islands and detained their boats. China protested the Philippine action. The reports state that the fishermen were still under detention as of December 21, 1998. On May 23, 1999, a Philippine navy vessel chased and collided with a Chinese fishing vessel near the Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese vessel sank as a result of the collision, which Philippines labeled as "accidental." China expressed "strong displeasure" for the incident. On July 19, 1999, a Philippine navy ship chased two Chinese fishing vessels in the Spratly Islands. The Philippine vessel fired warning shots at one of the fishing vessels before ramming the fishing boat. The Philippine side claimed that the ramming was accidental. China filed a protest in response to the Philippine show of force. On October 30, 1999, Vietnamese troops allegedly shot a Philippine air force plane flying over Pigeon Reef (a reef controlled by Vietnam). Vietnam accused Philippines of seriously violating Vietnam's sovereignty and reiterated its claim to sovereignty over all the Spratly Islands. In the first two months of 2000, Philippines navy boarded several Chinese fishing vessels and fired warning shots across the bows of two Chinese vessels near the Scarborough Shoal. The participants mentioned that they wanted to solve the Spratlys issue peacefully after the incidents. First and last day of dispute was on 3/23/2000.

This militarized dispute consists of four incidents in which North Korean and South Korean forces squabbled over their border. The dispute began on 6/2/2001 when three North Korean cargo vessels crossed the Northern Limit Line, returning to international waters when they were challenged by South Korean naval vessels. A second North Korean incursion occurred on 9/26/2001 when North Korean forces accidentally encroached across the DMZ on two separate occasions. In response, South Korean border forces fired warning shots. On 11/18/2001 another North Korean border violation occurred when a North Korean patrol boat violated the Northern Limit Line and remained in South Korean waters for 36 minutes before being driven out. On 11/27/2001 North and South Korean forces along the DMZ exchanged fire. There were no injuries or fatalities from the exchange of fire, only minor damage. North Korea is coded as the revisionist state in this dispute because their actions are challenging the post Korean War status quo. In this dispute, North Korea challenges both the Northern Limit Line and the DMZ that were established following the Korean war. First day of dispute was on 6/2/2001 and last day of dispute was on 11/10/2004.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The *Republic of Korea* (South Korea) was proclaimed on August 15, 1948, while North Korea attained its independence on September 10, 1948. On December 12, 1948, the *United Nations *(UN) General Assembly established the *United Nations Commission on Korea* (UNCOK) to facilitate unification negotiations between North and South Korea. UNCOK consisted of fifteen personnel from Australia, China, El Salvador, France, India, Philippines, and Syria (including 32 staff personnel from the UN Secretariat). UNCOK issued a report to the UN General Assembly on September 2, 1949 which warned of a possible civil war between North and South Korea. Turkey replaced Syria as a member of UNCOK on October 21, 1949. UNCOK requested the UN secretary-general to provide ten military observers on March 25, 1950. North Korean troops invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, and President Syngman Rhee of South Korea requested military assistance from the United States and other countries. The UN Security Council demanded an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of North Korean troops from South Korea on June 25, 1950. The UN Security Council authorized the use of military force to "repel the armed attack" against South Korea on June 27, 1950. President Harry Truman of the US decided to intervene in support of South Korea on June 27, 1950. US military aircraft attacked North Korean troops beginning on June 27, 1950, and British military aircraft attacked North Korean troops beginning on June 28, 1950. North Korean troops captured Seoul on June 28, 1950. On June 29, 1950, Australia decided to deploy naval ships near Korea. US troops were airlifted to South Korea from Japan beginning on June 30, 1950. New Zealand ordered two warships to the Korean area on July 1, 1950. US troops joined South Korean troops near Osan on July 4, 1950. Australian military aircraft began military action against North Korean troops on July 4, 1950. The UN Security Council established the *United Nations Military Command* (UNMC) on July 8, 1950, and appointed General Douglas McArthur as commander of the *United Nations Forces in Korea* (UNFK). UNFK consisted of some 340,000 troops from 16 countries. UNFK troops landed at Inchon on September 15, 1950, resulting in the deaths of 22 US soldiers. UNFK troops liberated Seoul on September 27, 1950, resulting in the death of 13,600 North Korean soldiers and 514 US soldiers. South Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea on September 30, 1950, and President Kim Il-Sung of North Korea requested military assistance from China on October 1, 1950. The Chinese government decided on October 2, 1950 to deploy "Chinese volunteers" to North Korea in support of North Korean troops. US troops crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea on October 7, 1950. The UN General Assembly dissolved UNCOK and authorized the establishment of the *United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea* (UNCURK) on October 7, 1950 to "observe and report any developments which might lead to or otherwise involve military conflict in Korea." UNCURK consisted of 20 personnel from seven countries. Some 300,000 Chinese troops crossed the Yalu River into North Korea beginning on October 25, 1950, and launched a military offensive against UNFK troops on November 25, 1950. Lester Pearson of Canada, president of the UN General Assembly, unsuccessfully attempted to mediate a ceasefire agreement from December 14, 1950 to January 15, 1951. Chinese and North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea on December 26, 1950, and captured Seoul on January 4, 1951. Some 800,000 individuals fled Seoul to southern Korea. UNICEF provided humanitarian assistance to South Koreans displaced during the conflict. The UN General Assembly condemned Chinese aggression in Korea on February 1, 1951. The UN General Assembly established a good offices commission on February 1, 1951 to facilitate truce negotiations between North Korea and South Korea. UNFK troops re-captured Seoul on March 14, 1951. India appealed for a ceasefire on March 31, 1951, and Britain appealed for a ceasefire on April 1, 1951. General McArthur was dismissed as commander of the UNFK on April 11, 1951 after threatening nuclear war against China. General Matthew Ridgway was appointed as commander of the UNFK. Chinese troops launched a military offensive against South Korean and UNFK troops on April 22, 1951, but the military offensive was defeated on May 20, 1951. The UN good offices commission ended its efforts on May 15, 1951. The UN General Assembly imposed military sanctions (arms embargo) against China and North Korea on May 18, 1951. UN and North Korean representatives began truce negotiations in Kaesong on July 10, 1951. On July 27, 1951, the *Commonwealth of Nations* (CON) established the *British Commonwealth Force in Korea* (BCFK), which consisted of some 25,000 troops from six countries commanded by Major-General A. J. H. Cassels of Britain. North Korea suspended truce negotiations with UN representatives in Kaesong on August 23, 1951. UN and North Korean representatives moved truce negotiations to Panmunjom on October 25, 1951. General Mark W. Clark replaced UN commander General Ridgway on April 28, 1952. Chinese and North Korean troops launched a military offensive against UNFK troops on April 16, 1953. The countries signed a ceasefire agreement on July 27, 1953, which established a *demilitarized zone* (DMZ) near the 38th parallel. The UN General Assembly established the *United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission* (UNCMAC) and the *Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission* (NNSC) on July 28, 1953 to monitor the ceasefire and to conduct disarmament inspections in the DMZ. UNCMAC consisted of 50 military observers. The NNSC consisted of four representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland (including an additional 95 personnel from the four countries). Some 3 million individuals were killed during the conflict, including 2 million North and South Korean civilians, 316,000 North Korean troops, 103,000 South Korean troops, 422,000 Chinese troops, 51,000 US troops, and 3,000 BCFK troops (including 710 British troops, 291 Australian troops, 34 New Zealand troops, and 291 Canadian troops). *The NNSC investigated a North Korean violation of the ceasefire agreement on February 9, 1954. Chinese troops completed their withdrawal from Korea on October 22, 1958. *North Korean troops and South Korean police clashed in the DMZ on July 30, 1963, resulting in the deaths of four North Korean soldiers and one South Korean policeman. North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops in the DMZ on November 13, 1963, resulting in the death of one South Korean soldier. The UNCMAC accused North Korea of a "grave violation of the armistice agreement" on November 16, 1963. North Korean troops sank a South Korean naval patrol boat in the Sea of Japan on January 19, 1967, resulting in the deaths of 39 South Korean naval personnel. North Korean troops and South Korean troops clashed south of the DMZ on April 10-13, 1967, resulting in the deaths of seven North Korean soldiers and one South Korean soldier. South Korean military aircraft sank two North Korean boats on April 17-19, 1967, resulting in the death of one North Korean. North Korean patrol boats attacked South Korean fishing vessels on May 27-28, 1967, resulting in the deaths of 15 South Koreans. North Korean troops and South Korean troops clashed near the DMZ on June 29-July 5, 1967, resulting in the deaths of 15 North Korean soldiers and 14 South Korean soldiers. North Korean artillery bombed a South Korean military barracks near the DMK on October 19, 1967, resulting in the deaths of two South Korean soldiers. North Korean patrol boats seized several South Korean fishing vessels on November 3, 1967. North Korean and South Korean representatives held bilateral negotiations from October 12, 1972 to August 1973. UNCURK was dissolved on November 28, 1973. North Korean troops killed a South Korean soldier in the DMZ on May 4, 1977. North Korean and South Korean naval ships clashed near Tongyoung on July 22, 1979, resulting in the deaths of five North Koreans and two South Koreans. North Korea and South Korea resumed bilateral negotiations on September 4, 1990. President Hosni Mubarek of Egypt offered to mediate negotiations between North Korea and South Korea on April 9, 1999. North Korean and South Korean naval forces clashed in the Yellow Sea on June 15, 1999, resulting in the deaths of some 80 North Korean naval personnel. On September 3, 1999, South Korea warned North Korea against violating the maritime border between the countries.

The rivalry is unfinished as of December 2006. North Korea's alleged testing of nuclear weapons and of missiles in the first decade of the 21st century did not help the South-North relationship. Kim Dae-Jung's `sunshine policy' towards North Korea was replaced by a stronger policy of South Korea towards the North, given the North's unwillingness to cooperate and give up its nuclear weapons program. The possibility of war is as high as ever on the Korean Peninsula.

SB-CR:
People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) / Republic of Korea (South Korea) Years: 1949-Present. Issues at stake: Border; legitimate government of Korea; existence of separate states. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no accepted settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 14. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1986. Wars: 1950-1953. Summary: Korea had been occupied by the Japanese prior to WWII. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, US and Soviet forces divided Korea between them at the 38th parallel for administrative purposes, with the intent of maintaining a unified Korea. However, the growing cold war between the US and USSR set the stage for its continued division. Confrontations between the US and USSR over Korea began in 1946; in 1947 the US brought the problem to the UN which appointed the UN Temporary Commission on Korea. The commission supervised elections in the south in 1948, but could not gain access to the north. In August, 1948, Syngman Rhee declared the Republic of Korea in the south, but claimed authority over all of Korea; in September 1948, Kim Il-Sung proclaimed the rival Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Soviet troops left North Korea by December, 1948, while US troops were withdrawn over the first half of 1949, although both sides left military advisors. Even before US and Soviet troops were gone, but mostly in June, July, and August 1949, North Korean forces attacked South Korean forces across the border. This marks the beginning of the rivalry as the first militarized dispute between the two Koreas. The Korean war followed, starting in June, 1950. The 1953 cease-fire that ended the war did not settle the border issues, however, and both sides continued to claim that they were the sole government of Korea. Militarized incidents along the border continued through the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. While some of these were "accidental," many were directed by the central governments of the two states, and were extended in length as both sides made even minor incidents into major confrontations. Notes: Talks between 1990 and 1993 produced no results in terms of the fundamental problems between the two Koreas, although minor agreements (e.g. on cross-border visitation) were reached. The rivalry is unfinished as of December 2006. North Korea's alleged testing of nuclear weapons and of missiles in the first decade of the 21st century did not help the South-North relationship. Kim Dae-Jung's `sunshine policy' towards North Korea was replaced by a stronger policy of South Korea towards the North, given the North's unwillingness to cooperate and give up its nuclear weapons program. The possibility of war is as high as ever on the Korean Peninsula.
