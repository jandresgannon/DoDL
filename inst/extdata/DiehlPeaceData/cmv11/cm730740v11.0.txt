DYAD: KOREA - JAPAN
RIVALRY: RIV1322
DISPUTE(S): MID1490 MID16 

PSNOTES: The period 1900-1905 prior to the occupation by Japan is coded as .5 because there no MIDs in the period (these are before 1900), Japan already had significant influence in Korea in the 1900-1905 period, Korea was neutral in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, and the 1905 annexation agreement essentially codified Japanese domination even as Korea was pressured to sign it. Occupation periods are coded as .5, as are hegemonic relationships unless there is significant integration.
