PS-UPDATE2020:

PSNOTES: We left this as a severe rivalry because of repeated MIDs (primarily border clashes between soldiers from both countries). However, on May 7, 2015, both countries ratified a historic land boundary agreement, which warrants a lesser coding. Given that there appears not to be anything new since 2015 about border clashes, the relationship is coded as .50

TERRMID-CER: MID1469 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1469 per Huth and Allee 2002, India and Bangladesh disputed several enclaves along their border, a dispute that dates back to India-East Pakistan. However, the cm narrative describes the India-Bangladesh rivalry as one that is fuled mainly by rebel group activity across the porous border, not by clashes over the disputed enclaves. Here, Gibler 2018 is explicit that this MID occurred in the context of Bangladesh's increasing ties with Pakistan leading to soured Indo-Bangladeshi relations. Coded not territory because this was not connected to the disputed enclaves (cm narrative and news coverage of this MID likewise do not mention disputed territory).

TERRMID-CER: MID3626 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3626 Coded not territory because although this involved a border fence being constructed and the two states disputde several enclaves, there is no indication that the fence was being set up at a disputed border location. Gibler 2018 and news coverage of this incident are explicit that the fence was intended to police cross-border rebels (BBC 4/14/1986). per Huth and Allee 2002, India and Bangladesh disputed several enclaves along their border, a dispute that dates back to India-East Pakistan. However, the cm narrative describes the India-Bangladesh rivalry as one that is fuled mainly by rebel group activity across the porous border, not by clashes over the disputed enclaves.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3626 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3626 from Gibler 2018, in 1986 India resumed construction of a border fence, escalating tensions and leading to clashes between Bangladesh and India. Coded civil war MID because, although the events of this MID do not directly involve militarized rebels, per Gibler 2018 MID3055 description, the purpose of the fence was to curtail militarized rebels from crossing the border. Civil conflict therefore motivates the events of this MID.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID4005 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, in 1995 an Indian repair crew was at the river embankment on the Muhari River, an inland river boundary between India and Bangladesh. Bengali troops fired on the Indian crew, and Indian troops returned fire. Coded territorial MID because the Muhuri River is a disputed inland river boundary, and this clash therefore occurred across a disputed border.

CIVWARMID: MID4555 3 -- not civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID4555 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4555 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, in 2002-2007 India and Bangladesh engaged in a series of border clashes. The clashes began when civilians from India would cross into Bangladesh and attack villagers; Indians were angry about influxes of refugees into their homeland. India began forcefully expelling refugees back to Bangladesh, leading to clashes. Coded not civil war because the cm narrative and Gibler 2018 specify that these were civilians (as opposed to rebels), and I could find no mention in news coverage of militarized rebels connected to this MID. There was an active rebel group, the Tripura National Volunteers, who fought against immigration from Bangladesh (Ghosh 2003), but there is no indication that they are connected to the fighting here. Also, I could find no evidence of militarized rebel activity in Bangladesh leading to refugees fleeing into India. It seems that media outlets and general public discourse around the issue of Bengali refugees coming into India over the years use the word "refugees" as a catch-all term to mean economic migrants. There are some instances of communal violence generating refugees into India in recent years (see, e.g., The Diplomat 2018), but the Bengalis coming into India during this time (2006-2007) would not legally fit the definition of a refugee (fleeing conflict or persecution). There is therefore no evidence of civil conflict activity in Bangladesh associated with the refugees in this MID.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4592 from Gibler 2018, in 2008 Indian vessels sailed into Bengali territorial waters and were intercepted by Bengali warships.

Sovereignty over the uninhabitable island grants a more favorable maritime boundary in the Bay of Bengal. Coded not islands because, although there was a disputed island nearby, the island dispute is motivated by the maritime dispute and the events of this MID did not involve the island itself.

Indian and Bangladeshi troops exchanged fire after some Indian civilians, guarded by Indian troops, refused to stop the planting of a tea plantation that was encroaching on Bangladesh’s territory. Although there is some dispute of India's revisionist type, India is coded as a territorial revisionist since it is attempting to alter the territorial status quo for economic gain. First day of dispute was on 3/7/2002 and last day of dispute was on 3/7/2002.

The shared border between Bangladesh and India was a source of major tension as violations and raids by both civilians and official forces sparked localized clashes between Bangladeshi and Indian military forces. Additionally, India undertook a policy of forcibly deporting several thousand Bangladeshi civilians, who India claimed entered the country illegally, living in Indian territory near the shared border. These forcible deportations resulted in additional violent clashes between Bangladeshi and Indian forces as Bangladeshi military troops either attempted to stop the deportations on Indian soil or sought to turn Indian troops out of Bangladeshi territory. First day of dispute was on 7/24/2002 and last day of dispute was on 1/28/2007.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Bangladeshi Indian relations have been characterized by border control and demarcation issues since Bangladesh gained its independence from Pakistan in 1974. The border issues date from the hasty demarcation of the border in 1947 at the time of Indian-Pakistani partition. Both governments also accuse one another of harboring and supporting rebels. 

MID1469 occurred April 19 through 21 of 1976. Tensions between India and Bangladesh were high prior to the dispute for several reasons. Bangladesh had been accusing India of supporting a rebel group (the Chittagong Hill Tract Rebels) that had clashed with Bangladeshi armed forces. The terrain of the actual border is not conducive for patrolling and securing. There are few natural barriers which enables guerillas, bandits and smugglers to cross easily. Bangladesh also accused India of involvement in a coup in which Sheik Mujibar Rahman was assassinated along with nine membes of his family. Border incidents between Bangladeshi police and insurgents took place with the insurgents attacking from the Indian side of the border. Tensions erupted in four clashes between Indian and Bangladeshi armed forces with a number of fatalities on both sides. 

MID3109 occurred on November 23, 1980. Here, Bangladeshi troops and Indian troops clashed near Tamavil on November 21-23, 1980. MID3096 occurred on September 24, 1981. India deployed troops on New Moore Island on May 9, 1981. Bangladesh protested the deployment of Indian troops on the island on May 11, 1981, and requested the withdrawal of Indian troops from the island. Bangladesh deployed gunboats in the area on May 12, 1981. Bangladesh and India deployed gunboats in the New Moore Island area on August 9-12, 1981. The countries agreed on September 13, 1981 to resolve the New Moore-South Talpatty Island dispute peacefully. Bangladeshi troops and Indian troops were deployed near the border on September 29, 1981 after border incidents on September 24-28, 1981. India withdrew its gunboats and troops from the New Moore Island area on October 6, 1981. 

MID3055 occurred from December of 1983 until June of 1984. Several incidents occurred here over the status of the border and territorial sovereignty. India constructed a barbed wire fence to keep illegal border crossers out of India. A Bangladeshi border guard was killed in one of the salvos. 

From February through April of 1986 MID3626 occurred. Here a number of incidents took place especially along the Muhuri River area. A two day meeting took place to discuss the border issue after which another skirmish took place. One Bangladeshi border guard was killed. 

MID2779 occurred in June of 1987. Bangladesh alleged that Indian troops attacked and killed 11 individuals in the village of Nalvarchar in Bangladesh on June 1, 1987, but India denied the allegation on June 3, 1987. Bangladeshi troops and Indian troops clashed near the border on June 25, 1987, resulting in the deaths of seven Bangladeshi soldiers. 

MID4006 occurred May 20 through 22 1996. The chief of the Bangladeshi military was sacked by the civilian government. This prompted members of the Bangladeshi armed forces to move on Dhaka in support of the chief. In response to the instability at their doorstep, India tightened security at the border with Bangladesh. 

In April of 1996 six Indian paramilitary soldiers were killed in an ambush by secessionist rebels. In response India tightened its border with Bangladesh in hopes of preventing the rebels from fleeing across the border. (I was not able to locate reference to a direct clash between India and Bangladesh. This item was the closest I could find to a MID. I searched the exact dates of the MID and widened the search parameters to a month prior and after the occurrence of the MID. I searched in Lexus/Nexus Asian News, the New York Times, the Times of London, Facts on File, and a general Google.com search. J. Klein.)

MID4313 occurred in April of 2001. According to the Bangladesh government, since 1971, Indian forces have occupied a small sliver of land along their border near the village of Pyrdiwah. Troops of the Bangladeshi Rifles (border troops) occupied the disputed village. In the fighting that followed, 15 members of India's border forces, the Border Security Force (BSF) were killed, along with several of the attacking soldiers. Indian forces responded and retook the village. Between 10,000 and 20,000 villagers living in the area fled the fighting, with at least 17 suffering wounds. The combat remained limited to the border troops of the respective nations, though mortars were used in addition to automatic weapons fire. Several villages were destroyed or heavily damaged in the fighting. Several of the Indian dead appeared to have suffered brutal, non-combat deaths, which were blamed on mob violence perpetuated by Bangladesh civilians. The governments of both nations worked quickly to defuse the tension and end the fighting.

Talks between Bangladesh and India took place in March of 2002. They met in Dhaka to discuss disputes along their four-thousand-kilometer border. 

Dhaka has protested alleged attempts by Indian border guards to forcibly deport Bengali-speaking Muslim Indians into Bangladesh, a report said on January 27, 2003. The Indian Embassy denied the allegations. Indian border security forces reportedly gathered about 400 Bengali-speaking Muslims near the border over the weekend and tried to force them into Bangladesh, a border official said on customary condition of anonymity. Bangladesh border guards stopped the Bengali-speakers from crossing over because they could not show any identity papers or prove that they came from Bangladesh, the official said. The Bengali-speakers were taken away by Indian guards after spending the night in the border area, the official said. The Indian embassy in Dhaka called the reports "baseless," and said Indian guards were not forcing any one-let alone Indian nationals-into Bangladesh. "The reports are baseless. No one is being forced to cross over," Deputy High Commissioner Dilip Sinha, the number two at the Indian mission in Dhaka, told The Associated Press. Border troops have been put on alert along Bangladesh's western frontier with India to prevent any more "push-in" attempts, the Bangladeshi border official said. India and Bangladesh share a porous 4,000-kilometer (2,500 mile-) border. The Bangladesh Foreign Ministry summoned India's deputy high commissioner in Dhaka to express concerns over "the seriousness of the situation" and urged India to halt such attempted push-ins, Bangladesh's state-run news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, reported. The Indian diplomat was requested to convey to his government the "utmost seriousness with which the people and the government of Bangladesh have been observing the unfortunate development," the report said. India claims thousands of Bangladeshis live illegally in India, a charge Dhaka denies. Dhaka says the Bengali-speakers either migrated to India during colonial times or are from India's West Bengal state, which shares a border and a common language with Bangladesh.

On February 3, 2003, Bangladesh accused India of trying to push Indian citizens over the border, dismissing demands from New Delhi to "cooperate" on the issue. "This push-in effort should stop," Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary Shamser Mobin Chowdhury told AFP when asked about the Indian leaders' comments. He said India's actions "did not serve the interest of promoting bilateral relations." "There are laid-down procedures to settle outstanding issues," Chowdhury said. India announced it was deploying more troops to its border with Bangladesh as some 213 people remained stranded in a village 650 kilometers (400 miles) north of Calcutta. Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani, speaking Wednesday in Singapore, urged Bangladesh to "cooperate" with New Delhi against the "massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh." He lashed out at Bangladeshi statements that the stranded people are Indians, saying: "You cannot base something on total lies and untruths." India, which last month announced a campaign to deport Bangladeshi migrants, says the 213 are Bangladeshis illegally in its territory. Bangladesh insists the groups are Indians who speak Bangladesh's national language, Bengali. It alleges that India has repeatedly tried to force Bengali-speaking Indians across the border. India and Bangladesh have historically had warm if unsteady relations. Ties have soured dramatically since late last year when India charged that Muslim-majority Bangladesh was becoming a haven for extremists, allegations dismissed by Dhaka.

On February 16, 2003, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Morshed Khan has wrapped up his visit to India, saying that Bangladesh favors engagement with India over issues such as illegal migration and shelter for insurgent groups. Bangladesh firmly believes that through engagement and peaceful discussions, and not through use of force, all differences and irritants could be resolved, Foreign Minister M. Morshed Khan said. He was exchanging views, over breakfast, with Indian columnists, senior journalists as well as with international media representatives and the civil society people. In a bid to lower temperature over the standoff on "illegal immigrants", Khan said this issue should not be allowed to impede forward movement in relations with India and favored "sustained engagement" between the two countries to resolve all differences. "At times there are irritants. We should not allow the border incidents to act as a stumbling block in our relations," Foreign Minister Mohd Morshed Khan said. Morshed Khan said that Bangladesh would not allow the long and porous border with India to disturb its bilateral relations. He said that security concern should not be seen in isolation because Bangladesh firmly believes that insecurity in Bangladesh could disturb neighboring countries including India and similarly security problems in India were bound to affect Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Foreign Minister made courtesy calls today, first on India's Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani then on Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. Since these were courtesy calls, both the Indian and Bangladesh officials did not reveal what Khan and two of India's top-most leaders discussed. "They looked for constructive engagement between India and Bangladesh and hoped that the two countries would progress forward", an Indian official said, adding that Khan extended an invitation to Vajpayee for a visit to Bangladesh which the Indian Prime Minister accepted. Khan was scheduled to meet India's opposition leader Sonia Gandhi, but that could not materialize since the Congress leader was out of town for electioneering. During the day, the Bangladesh Foreign Minister had hosted lunch for some select Indian leaders, including former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral. And, in turn, Gujral invited Khan for dinner at his residence.

Indian border security officials have proposed a joint paramilitary operation with Bangladesh to flush out militants from each other's territory, a top Indian security official said on May 3, 2004. The proposal was made at a meeting the previous week between officials of India's Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles, BSF chief Ajai Raj Sharma told reporters. "They have neither agreed, nor refused. The Bangladesh Rifles has said they will refer our proposal to their government," Sharma said. India has already taken several measures to strengthen its porous 4,096-kilometer (2,560-mile) border with Bangladesh, including erecting a barbed-wired fence along some stretches. India claims that separatist guerrillas and Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, have been using Bangladeshi territory for attacks in India, a charge both Pakistan and Bangladesh deny. India has been fighting insurgencies in its remote northeastern states and in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir for decades. Meanwhile, Bangladesh alleges that anti-Bangladeshi terrorists are hiding in India. Sharma said the joint operation could be a "good solution" to the charges of abetting terrorism that India and Bangladesh trade against each other. He handed his Bangladeshi counterparts a list of 194 camps allegedly run by Indian insurgents from Bangladeshi territory. The Bangladeshis gave Sharma a list of 37 Bangladeshi rebel camps that Dhaka says are located India. Sharma said India had again proposed joint patrols of the border. In Dhaka, the Bangladesh Rifles said both sides have agreed to cooperate in fighting cross-border crimes like smuggling and human trafficking. They also agreed to hold regular meetings at the border to discuss any tensions and security issues that may arise, the Bangladesh Rifles said in a statement issued after the five-day talks.

Officials from Bangladesh and India held talks on September 16, 2004, on illegal migration, smuggling, and insurgents that New Delhi claims are operating bases across the border. The first day of the two-day talks focused on border issues, including coordinated border patrols and the trafficking of people, drugs and weapons, officials said. A joint statement on the talks' outcome was expected from the talks. India claims that autonomy-seeking insurgents from its northeastern states have camps in neighboring Bangladesh-a charge Dhaka denies. India wants Bangladesh to crack down on the alleged bases and deport the rebel leaders. Dhaka wants India to extradite several members of organized crime gangs, saying they have crossed into India from Bangladesh. "We have a cordial discussion, and I am very much hopeful of getting fruitful outcomes," M. Omar Farooq, Bangladesh's home secretary, told reporters. His Indian counterpart, Dhirendra Singh, called the talks constructive. India and Bangladesh share a porous 4,000-kilometer (2,500-mile) border, where skirmishes and crime are common. Indian officials say illegal migration from Bangladesh has dropped in recent years after New Delhi fenced half the border. But Bangladesh says the fence violates international rules, and denies having illegal citizens in India.

On January 17, 2005, Bangladesh asserted that it would agree to the signing of a tripartite agreement to allow a gas pipeline from Myanmar to India only if New Delhi agreed to give it a "corridor" with Nepal and Bhutan. "We will only sign the tripartite agreement if we get the corridor facilities with Nepal and Bhutan to import electricity," Minister of state for Energy Musharraf Hossain told reporters in Dhaka on return from a tripartite energy meeting in Myanmar. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar agreed this week in the Myanmar meet to cooperate in gas exploration and an overland pipeline project from western Myanmar to India through Bangladesh. During the meet, Dhaka had sought the right to access hydro-electricity from Nepal and Bhutan through Indian territory and a corridor to bring in commodities. Hossain said a technical committee would prepare a report by March and the next tripartite meeting would be held in Dhaka in April 2005.

On August 4, 2005, a two-day Bangladesh-India Joint Working Group meeting has ended without any major breakthrough, but has agreed on a road map to ease non-tariff barriers and facilitate trade between the two countries. "We have approved a road map in a step forward to eliminate non-tariff barriers and facilitate trade so that more Bangladeshi products can have access to the Indian market," M.V.P.C. Shastry, joint commerce secretary and head of the Indian delegation told reporters on August 4, 2005. The two sides signed a 13-page agreed minutes the day before, the officials said. The meeting of officials from the Commerce Ministries of both countries which began on Monday, deferred revision of the India-Bangladesh Trade Agreement, but reports said both sides have, however, agreed on the points for change. Earlier, Bangladesh side had said they were close to finalizing the revised trade accord between the two neighbors. Bangladesh commercial councilor to India Wasiuddin Ahmed had said on Monday the two sides are nearly close to finalizing revision of the trade agreement, although some points are yet to be resolved which might reach an agreement.

On September 22, 2005, Bangladesh and India ended a two-day Joint Rivers Commission meeting without any tangible breakthrough on sharing the waters of a common river, the Teesta. Though the Water Resources Ministers of India and Bangladesh both aired high hopes about a positive impact of the talks, the two-day JRC meeting could not set any timetable for a permanent arrangement of the Teesta water sharing, a longstanding issue. They could not reach any concrete understanding either over India's planned dam at Tipaimukh on the Barak river, upstream the Meghna basin. However, the 36th JRC meeting, held after a gap of two years, agreed that India would communicate data on flood forecasting and water falls to Bangladesh via e-mail so Bangladesh could take advance preparation to combat any hazard of floods. Indian Water Resources Minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi and his counterpart Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, who signed the agreed minutes, decided to go around inspecting the vulnerable sites of river erosion on the frontier shortly to have a firsthand view of the problem and find solutions-without depending on bureaucrats. Addressing a joint press conference at Hotel Sonargaon, Dasmunshi said the meeting decided that the Joint Committee of Experts (JCE) would study the Teesta flow and report to the next JRC meeting in six months to enable it to arrive at a sharing "agreement"-or "arrangement"-on the river waters. About the Tipaimukh dam, he said the planned project, whose design has not yet been finalized, is not meant for irrigation but for generating hydropower, which would also help flood management in Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh. On Dhaka's concern, he said India would inform Bangladesh at the next JRC meeting whether there is any diversion structure on the Barak other than Fulertal. On arsenic contamination management, Bangladesh agreed to an Indian proposal and decided to send a list of scientists and other people to New Delhi immediately to receive kits and technical support in tackling the chemical poisoning of groundwater-apparently a pandemic problem that also has affected India's West Bengal state. On Dhaka's anxiety about New Delhi's controversial river-linking project, Dasmunshi said the project would not affect Bangladesh as it would not be implemented in the Himalayan region. "Before affecting the lower-riparian Bangladesh, it would affect Bihar and West Bengal... I can categorically assure that India will not do anything against the interest of Bangladesh," the Indian Union Minister from West Bengal told a questioner. He, however, said Dhaka's media misquoted him as saying that the river-linking project would not be implemented by India in next 2000 years. Under the agreement, India will supply data on water level and rainfall from Gawahati to Bangladesh 66 hours ahead instead of present 43 hours, and from Farakka Barrage to Bangladesh 67 hours ahead instead of present 40 hours. This communication of data and flood forecast will be made by email. On the question of augmenting the Ganges flow at Farakka as per 1996 water-sharing agreement, the Bangladesh Water Resources Minister, Hafiz Uddin Ahmed, Dhaka mooted the idea of constructing reservoir through a tripartite arrangement among Nepal, India and Bangladesh. But India refused to discuss the issue within the framework of the JRC. Both the Ministers described the outcome of the 36th JRC meeting as positive and a step forward towards resolving the issues on the waterfront of the two neighbors. They also decided to hold the JRC meeting twice a year. 

On 15 March, 2006, the Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia is scheduled to visit New Delhi for three days from 20 March. The 3-day visit is significant for both countries at a time when the relations may be not at their best. At this point of time, Bangladesh is perceived by India as uncooperative and insular, while India is perceived in Bangladesh as uninterested and insensitive. There is a saying that one may choose one's friends but not neighbors. India surrounds Bangladesh on three sides with the opening to the Bay of Bengal on the fourth side, where the Indian Navy has a dominating presence. The geo-political-economic compulsions within and outside the region necessitate cooperative and mutually supporting relationship between the two neighbors. Bangladesh's relations with India have gone through an up and down curve during the 34 years. This uneven relationship appears to be due to misperception of one country against the other at different times. One fact is that the ties of history are so enduring and pervasive that relationship between the two exists independently of governments and their policies. Bangladesh's relations with India do not rest on normal tests in measuring the content and depth of relations. For example, half a million of Bangladeshis reportedly visit India per year. Similarly, the Bangladesh missions in India are overwhelmed in issuing visas to Indian nationals for their trips to Bangladesh. These processes are being undertaken quietly and without any hindrance or impediments. These are success stories in bilateral relations. Bangladesh needs India as much as India needs Bangladesh. India is 23 times larger than Bangladesh and India's economy is not only much larger and more diversified but also is more advanced in industry, services, science and technology. The asymmetry in economic size and populations has impact for the way in which the distribution of possible gains is evaluated in both countries. Obviously the gains are seldom equally shared and this is a cold reality. Given the background of India's rise as an industrial power, Bangladesh needs to work out a framework of cooperative relations with India. 

India and Bangladesh have taken the first step in resolving their complex boundary dispute by conducting a joint survey and identifying disputed land, a newspaper report said on September 19, 2006. The two-year survey of boundary lands, conducted jointly by experts from India and Bangladesh, has identified 607 hectares (1,500 acres) of disputed land as belonging to India, the Hindustan Times newspaper said. Another 314 hectares (776 acres) of land has been identified as belonging to Bangladesh. "The survey was completed about a month back," the newspaper quoted Somesh Goyel, inspector general of India's Border Security Force as saying. The question of formally transferring the land was likely to come up at talks between the Border Security Force and its Bangladeshi counterpart, the Bangladesh Rifles, in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta. Most of the land identified as belonging to India falls in the state of West Bengal, adjoining Bangladesh. Indian and Bangladeshi officials were not immediately available for comment. Tensions often arise between the two South Asian neighbors because their 4000-kilometer (2,500-mile)-long frontier is not clearly demarcated. In many stretches the border is marked only by rivers that occasionally shift course, sparking land disputes among villagers on either side.

The usage of water from their shared rivers and the immigrants issues have not been resolved as of December 2006. The relations between the two countries remain cold, and new issues of contention were added to the agenda (the gas pipeline from Myanmar).

Bangladesh became a member of the international system on January 1, 1972. On February 8, 1972, Bangladesh and India agreed to pull out the Indian troops that helped Bangladesh gain independence from Pakistan. On his first visit abroad, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, said to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that he wants to promote cooperation between the two countries `inspired by a vision of lasting peace, amity, and good neighborliness.' On May 24, 1975, India and Bangladesh worked out a solution over the waters of the river Ganges. The two countries under the leadership of the Indian-Bangladesh Joint River Commission, built a dam which allowed the waters of the river Ganges to supply tributaries in both countries. Thus, the water crisis in Calcutta was addressed. On August 19, 1975, a few days after the coup d'etat in Banglandesh, the new government of this country announced that it wants to seek `friendship and cooperation' with India and that it will abide by all bilateral agreements previously signed between the two countries. On August 27, 1975, the Indian government recognized the legitimacy of the government of President Khondakar Mushtaque Ahmed, who took power in a coup d'etat that ended in the assassination of Sheik Mujibur Rahman. 

Bangladeshi troops and Indian troops clashed near the border on April 19-20, 1976, resulting in the death of one Bangladeshi. India protested the incidents on April 20 and April 21, 1976. Major General Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh accused India of providing military assistance to rebels on September 26, 1976.
