This dispute is comprised of a series of incidents generated by United States led efforts to restore the rule of Haitian President Aristide after he was deposed in a coup. The incidents begin with a naval blockade in October of 1993 where the United States was joined by a number of other nations (Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Haiti, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). As the blockade wore on, and the military junta led by General Cedras remained in place, the United States resorted to a number of threats of military action and displays of force. The dispute was resolved with the return of Aristide only after the intercession of US Special Envoy Jimmy Carter. An invasion force was in the air as the deal was brokered. First day of dispute was on 10/20/1993 and last day of dispute was on 9/29/1994.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the UK and Haiti took place in the 19th century and resulted from British attempts to collect financial claims on the behalf of British nationals. In 1875, the UK sent a warship to La Tortue to collect a mahogany concession on behalf of a British national. This MID is not recorded in the MID 3.0 dataset. In 1883, the UK participated in a naval blockade of Haiti with France and Spain, along with supplying arms to liberal Haitian rebels and exiles in an 1883 rebellion, MID1683. This was mostly due to the fact that the Haitian government refused to recognize claims made by the British. In July 1886 and March 1887, the UK sent a naval ship to Haiti to secure the release of a British national from jail and collect further claims, MID2683 and MID3136. In 1887, Haiti agreed to settle the largest British claim, known as the *Maunder claim*, leading to the withdraw of the British ship from Haitian waters. 

The rivalry ends in the 19th century probably because of increasing US intervention which sought to keep European powers out of Haiti while reconciling their claims. Beginning in 1881, the US had five interventions that serve to illustrate this point, eventually leading to the US occupation of Haiti. Further British claims thus became resolved through diplomacy with Haitian and US officials instead of through force or intimidation.

In the 20th century, there were two disputes between the UK and Haiti, in 1963 and 1994, respectively. These are isolated and not part of the 19th century rivalry. 

On April 26, 1963, Haitian troops entered a Dominican chancery in search of fromer Lieutenant Francois Benoit who President Duvalier suspected of murdering the driver and two bodyguards of his children's limosine. These murders came after a series of terror attacks by Duvalier to eliminate any rivals from elections that were to be held in February. These elections never occured. On the 28th of April, the Dominican Armed Forces went on alert as Juan Bosch demanded that the Haitians leave the chancery and withdraw its troops that had it surrounded. The British ship, H.M.S. Cavalier, along with Canadian and US ships entered the Gulf of Gonave in preparation for intervention, MID1002. On May 15, 1963 Duvalier declared the beginning of an unconstitutional second term, ending or at least limiting his terror attacks and ending any justifications for foreign intervention. On June 3, 1963, the British ship left the Gulf of Gonave along with the US. 

In 1993, the UK sent a frigate to Haiti to participate in an international naval blockade against the country to enforce a UN embargo, MID4016.
