On June 30, 2002, Ugandan soldiers crossed into neighboring Kenya and looted several head of cattle. Later, on July 1, a group of Ugandan soldiers crossed the border into the Kenyan town of Amaguriat. While in the town, the soldiers entered into a firefight with local Kenyan police, in which one of the Ugandan soldiers was killed before they retreated. First day of dispute was on 7/1/2002 and last day of dispute was on 7/1/2002.

Relations between Kenya and Uganda deteriorated in March 1995, leading up to a Ugandan troop build-up along the northeastern border with Kenya. The troop deployment, starting March 22, was aimed at curbing alleged incursions into Uganda by Kenya security forces. Uganda claimed that Kenyan security forces entered Uganda, burnt villages and killed the father of a prominent Ugandan parliamentarian. Relations between Kenya and Uganda had been tense following Uganda's refusal to hand over the leader of an alleged Kenyan guerrilla movement, Brig. John Odongo, from exile in Uganda, who has since been relocated to Ghana. In early March, 200 attackers believed to belong to the February Eighteen Movement raided a police post in western Kenya killing administration policemen and getting away with 13 guns and 1,300 rounds of ammunition. The Kenyan border violation was in response to this rebel attack originating from Uganda. First and last day of dispute was on 3/00/1995.

Relations between Kenya and Uganda deteriorated in March 1995, with both accusing the other of harboring armed opposition groups. Kenya violated the Ugandan border in search of Kenyan rebels in March 1995, and Uganda responded with a troop buildup along the border. This dispute (MID4083) was left unsettled. Then later in November 1995, another dispute involved a Kenyan military buildup along the border, which Kenya said was justified by fears that Uganda was about to invade "with the help of Kenyan rebels and South African mercenaries." Leaders of both countries met in early 1996 to remove the suspicion that had built up in 1995. Both pledged cooperation in the fight against bandits and rebels along their common border in the future. First and last day of dispute was on 11/00/1995.

Kenya fortified its border with Uganda without specific reasons given. There has been tension in the border region before. First day of dispute was on 2/16/1997 and last day of dispute was on 2/00/1997.

NARRATIVE-CM:

President Amin of Uganda placed his military on alert for an invasion of British forces from Kenya as tensions grew concerning the death sentence of British journalist, Denis Hills who criticized Amin. On June 25, Amin accused Britain of sending two warships with soldiers to Kenya in preparation for an invasion. The British government called the deployment a routine visit. Kenyan press accused Ugandan soldiers of murdering and chasing off railway officials in February, 1973. Uganda claimed that the attack was planned by former Ugandan president, Obote and his supporters. Tanzanian president, Julius K. Nyerere had a one day meeting with President Kenyatta to discuss "matters affecting the East African Community". On July 1, 1975, Amin announced that he would grant Hills a pardon. President Kenyatta of Kenya threatened war with Uganda in February, 1976 over a border dispute. President Amin of Uganda withdrew his claims on the disputed area on Febraury 27, 1976, but tensions continued. Kenya protested the killing of a Kenyan student in Uganda on March 12, 1976. Amidst growing tensions and a Soviet arms build-up in Uganda, US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger visited Kenya to discuss the situation with President Kenyatta in April, 1976. On June 16, 1976, the United States announced that it would begin supplying arms consisting of 12 F-5 jet fighters to Kenya to offset the Soviet Union's supplying of arms to Uganda. Israeli troops rescued some 100 hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda on July 3-4, 1976, and Israeli military aircraft used in the rescue mission landed in Nairobi, Kenya for refueling before returning to Israel. President Idi Amin of Uganda accused Kenya of collaborating with Israel on July 4, 1976. Some 3,000 Kenyans fled from Uganda on July 5-15, 1976. On July 8, Kenya demanded that Uganda pay for all goods being shipped through Kenya because of the debt Uganda owed it. On July 9, Kenya restricted Uganda's access by rail to the Indian Ocean. The Kenyan government reported on the tenth of July that 245 Kenyan citizens had been killed in Uganda. Libya sent several Mirage jets to Uganda, and France protested the gift as a violation of the terms of the sale. On July 12, 1976, the United States sent a frigate and a Navy patrol plane to Kenya to show support in their dispute with Uganda. A second Navy patrol plane was sent to Kenya by the United States the following day. Also, on July 13, Kenya sent a letter to the UN Security Council accusing Uganda of massacring Kenyans living in Uganda and mounting a military build-up on the border. On July 16, 1976, Kenyan truck and railway workers refused to enter Uganda. Uganda promised not to invade Kenya on July 21. Uganda cut electricity supplies to Kenya on July 24. Kenya severed the supply of oil to Uganda on July 25, 1976, and President Amin retaliated by threatening to go to war with Kenya. The British government cut diplomatic relations on July 28 with Uganda in response to its recent behavior. Uganda agreed to hold negotiations with Kenya on July 30, 1976. The same day, Liberian ambassador, Dusomo Johnson suggested that both countries impose a news blackout on their dispute as each had been attacking each other in the press. President Amin of Uganda and President Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya signed an agreement in Nairobi on August 7, 1976, which provided for the withdrawal of troops from the border region. Kenya resumed the supply of oil to Uganda on August 11, 1976. Kenya and Uganda agreed to resume diplomatic relations on February 10, 1978. Kenya closed its border with Uganda in April, 1979 to stop the inflow of fleeing Ugandan soldiers fleeing from the invasion of Tanzania. On December 15, 1987, at least 15 people were killed in fighting along the border with Kenya. The border was closed for a few days. On March 2, 1989, 300 to 400 armed Ugandans entered Kenya to steal cattle and killed an army officer. Kenyan soldiers then killed 72 of the cattle rustlers. The Kenyan government reported that two days later a Ugandan aircraft dropped two bombs on Kenya. The International Committee for the Red Cross reported that 5 people were killed. President Moi of Kenya visited President Museveni of Uganda in August of 1990 where they signed a 12-point agreement and restored full diplomatic relations with each other.

NARRATIVE-CR:
A shipment of 11 truckloads of weapons from China was caught and seized by Kenyan authorities being shipped through Kenya by Ugandans on May 16, 1965. The 22 Ugandan soldiers and 25 Ugandan and Tanzanian civilians who were transporting the arms were placed in jail in Kenya. Uganda and Tanzania threatened to break up the East African Common Market unless Kenya released the weapons. On May 23, a Ugandan economist announced that it was no longer willing to carry on economic relations with Kenya. Prime Minister Obote went to Kenya to offer apologies and request the return of the weapons on May 25. The following day, President Kenyatta accepted the Ugandan apology and agreed to return the weapons. This is designated as MID1366.

Kenyan press accused Ugandan soldiers of murdering and chasing off railway officials in February, 1973. Uganda claimed that it was planned by former Ugandan president, Obote and his supporters. Idi Amin's regime threatened thousands of Kenyans from the Luo tribe, living in Uganda, with expulsion. About 200 frightened Luo left Uganda. Kenya's trade-union organization threatened to block the movement of goods from and to Uganda, which would basically paralyze Uganda's economy as its imports and exports depend on Kenya's harbors. This is MID1367 which occurred on February 13, 1973. 

President Amin of Uganda placed his military on alert for an invasion of British forces from Kenya as tensions grew concerning the death sentence of British journalist, Denis Hills who criticized Amin. On June 25, 1975, Amin accused Britain of sending two warships with soldiers to Kenya in preparation for an invasion. The British government called the deployment a routine visit. On July 1, 1975, Amin announced that he would grant Hills a pardon, ending MID1809. 

President Kenyatta of Kenya threatened war with Uganda in February, 1976 over a border dispute in MID1368. President Amin of Uganda withdrew his claims on the disputed area on Febraury 27, 1976, but tensions continued. Kenya protested the killing of a Kenyan student in Uganda on March 12, 1976. 

Israeli troops rescued some 100 hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda on July 3-4, 1976, and Israeli military aircraft used in the rescue mission landed in Nairobi, Kenya for refueling before returning to Israel. President Idi Amin of Uganda accused Kenya of collaborating with Israel on July 4, 1976. Some 3,000 Kenyans fled from Uganda on July 5-15, 1976. On July 8, Kenya demanded that Uganda pay for all goods being shipped through Kenya because of the debt Uganda owed it. On July 9, Kenya restricted Uganda's access by rail to the Indian Ocean. The Kenyan government reported on the tenth of July that 245 Kenyan citizens had been killed in Uganda.

On July 16, 1976, Kenyan truck and railway workers refused to enter Uganda. Uganda promised not to invade Kenya on July 21. Uganda cut electricity supplies to Kenya on July 24. Kenya severed the supply of oil to Uganda on July 25, 1976, and President Amin retaliated by threatening to go to war with Kenya. Uganda agreed to hold negotiations with Kenya on July 30, 1976. 

President Amin of Uganda and President Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya signed an agreement in Nairobi on August 7, 1976, which provided for the withdrawal of troops from the border region. Kenya resumed the supply of oil to Uganda on August 11, 1976. This ended the series of conflicts that make up MID1368

Kenya and Uganda agreed to resume diplomatic relations on February 10, 1978. Kenya closed its border with Uganda in April, 1979 to stop the inflow of fleeing Ugandan soldiers fleeing from the invasion of Tanzania. 

Relations between the two countries were strained when in March, 1987 a Ugandan national died after a period of detention by Kenyan police. Further, Uganda decided to ship freight and fuel by rail instead of truck, which caused hardhip for Kenya. Kenya applied strict border controls on Ungandan traffic, making shipment excessively slow. Uganda accused Kenya of closing the border. On June 1, 1987, Uganda accused Kenya of cutting its electricity. Meetings were held on June 5-6, and the shipment issues seemed to be somewhat resolved. On December 15, 1987, at least 15 people were killed in fighting along the border with Kenya. The border was closed for a few days. This is designated as MID2804.

On March 2, 1989, 300 to 400 armed Ugandans entered Kenya to steal cattle and killed an army officer. Kenyan soldiers then killed 72 of the cattle rustlers. The Kenyan government reported that two days later a Ugandan aircraft dropped two bombs on Kenya. The International Committee for the Red Cross reported that 5 people were killed. This is MID3911.

President Moi of Kenya visited President Museveni of Uganda in August of 1990 where they signed a 12-point agreement and restored full diplomatic relations with each other.

On February 3, 1995, Kenyan authorities announced the existence of a subversive communist organization, the February 18 Movement or the FEM. The goal of this organization was to overthrow the government of Kenya. They alleged that they were based in Uganda. The Ugandan government denied the charges. Tensions increased in March, MID4083. On March 8, Uganda announced that Kenya's requests for the extradition of FEM leader Brig. John Odongo had been denied and that he had been transferred to a third country. On March 10, there was a military build-up along the border. On March 16, there were alleged attacks by FEM forces, but they denied it.

In November of 1995, President Moi of Kenya accused Uganda of harboring South African mercenaries who were planning an invasion of Kenya. Uganda claimed that Kenya was also supporting subversive groups who wanted to overthrow the regime of Museveni in Uganda. This is MID4084.

There is no real coherent conflict between these two countries as the disputes have been over different issues and have crossed multiple regimes. The fact that conflict has continued to flare up over this entire period, and as recently as 1995, indicates that it is too early to consider this rivalry terminated.

MID4249 started on February 16, 1997. Kenya has amassed a contingent of armed soldiers along its border with Uganda during the last five days, Uganda's local daily "the new vision" reported. Deployment of an unknown number of troops started over the weekend. It said investigation done among top security organs on both sides of the Uganda-Kenya border towns of Busia and Malaba indicated that there are seven positions so far taken by the Kenyan troops. In another development, six people were killed and three others injured over the weekend in tribal clashes occurred in Uganda's northeast district of Kotido between Uganda's Karimojong tribal men and Turkana tribal men from Kenya. Turkana tribal men, who crossed to Uganda early this year to graze and water their animals, fled back to Kenya with hundreds of cattle, goats, sheep and food they raided from Kaabong market near Kotido town, said the report.

Uganda became independent on October 9, 1962. Kenya became independent on December 12, 1963. On December 13, 1963, newly independent Kenya pledged to remain in the British Commonwealth and to seek a union with neighboring Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Uganda. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have made two attempts to unite in a regional organization since they gained independence. In each case, the nations sought a loose federation underpinned by an economic common market. In 1961, the three countries formed the East African Common Services Organization (EACSO), in which a shared and centralized administration was to provide services, including transportation, communication, tax collection, scientific research, social services and university education. The EACSO charter was also to create a common currency, a common appellate court, and a common market in which goods and labor could circulate freely. These were to be directed by a central legislative assembly. By 1965, the EACSO began to come apart due to growing tendencies toward nationalism and diverging economic and political policies. It never accomplished what it set to accomplish: an economic common market and it was finally ended in 1967.

A shipment of 11 truckloads of weapons from China was caught and seized being shipped through Kenya by Ugandans on May 16, 1965. The 22 Ugandan soldiers and 25 Ugandan and Tanzanian civilians who were transporting the arms were placed in jail in Kenya. Uganda and Tanzania threatened to break up the East African Common Market unless Kenya released the weapons. On May 23, 1965, a Ugandan economist announced that it was no longer willing to carry on economic relations with Kenya. Prime Minister Obote went to Kenya to offer apologies and request the return of the weapons on May 25, 1965. The following day, President Kenyatta accepted the Ugandan apology and agreed to return the weapons. On December 1, 1967, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania formed the East African Community, an attempt to save the common market in place since 1961. Even though the EAC was supposed to promote even stronger relations between the three countries, the animosities that led to the change from the EACSO to EAC were still present and blocked any significant developments towards an integrated East Africa. On January 25, 1971, the Ugandan Army stages a coup and overthrew the Ugandan president, Milton Obote. Tanzania and Kenya, the two other members of the East African Community which replaced the EACSO in 1967, did not recognize Idi Amin's regime right away. However, Kenya asked former Ugandan President Obote to leave Nairobi and recognized Amin's regime short afterwards. The second MID of RIV1108, MID1367 occurred on February 13, 1973. Kenyan press accused Ugandan soldiers of murdering and chasing off railway officials in February, 1973. Uganda claimed that it was planned by former Ugandan president, Obote and his supporters. Idi Amin's regime threatened thousands of Kenyans from the Luo tribe, living in Uganda, with expulsion. About 200 frightened Luo left Uganda. Kenya's trade-union organization threatened to block the movement of goods from and to Uganda, which would basically paralyze Uganda's economy as its imports and exports depend on Kenya's harbors.

The last MID of RIV1108, MID4249 ended in February 1997. Ugandans who have been held in Nairobi have been cleared and released, Kenya police said on August 1, 1997. Assistant Commissioner of Police in charge of Public Relations for the Kenyan police force, Peter Kimanthi, told The New Vision on phone there were no more Ugandans in Kenyan cells. "Ugandans who were found with proper documents were released," Kimanthi said, adding: "We are only holding illegal immigrants." Kimanthi said there were no Ugandans among the illegal immigrants in custody. "All Ugandans were released," Kimanthi emphasized when he was asked to explain what happened to Ugandans who were not found with proper documents. He said he did not know the number of people held without proper documents. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Rebecca Kadaga, issued a protest note to Kenya's High Commissioner to Uganda over the harassment of Ugandans in Kenya.

Uganda will raise with Nairobi difficulties its nationals are facing in penetrating the Kenyan market, President Yoweri Museveni said on May 27, 1998. At a luncheon with Ugandan manufacturers in Kampala, which was attended by the visiting Kenyan head of state, President Daniel arap Moi, Mr Museveni asked the business community to list the problems they said they were facing and hand the list to him instead of just complaining. "List the problems and give them to me instead of (just) talking about them, we shall approach them at a governmental level," he said. He said it was unlikely that Nairobi would ignore barriers hindering trade between the two countries because Uganda is a big market for Kenyan products. The business community, particularly manufacturers have complained that their attempts to penetrate the Kenyan market were being frustrated both officially and unofficially. Until recently, they noted, Kenya had banned the importation of maize from Uganda. This had adversely affected Ugandans, especially those living in the east where at times more maize than can be consumed locally is produced. Other problems raised by the business community include harassment by Kenyan police and criminals who masquerade as security officials. Other issues raised by the community included the introduction by the Kenya Revenue Authority of cash bonds, which has angered the community, with business people saying it had greatly increased their operational costs. Also of concern to the manufacturers was congestion at the port of Mombasa and inefficiency by the transport system. To resolve these particular problems, they called for the privatization of the Kenya Ports Authority and the merging of the Kenya Railways Corporation with its Ugandan counterpart to improve transport services. Kenya introduced the bonds last year to curb the diversion of transit goods into the local market. Addressing the luncheon, President Moi said his government was committed to enhancing the growth trade in the region. He promised to address the problems raised by the business community. He challenged the community to follow the example of Kenyans by investing across the borders. He told the business community that together with his Ugandan and Tanzanian counterparts, they would ensure that there was adequate security in the region to enhance investment. Mr Moi, who arrived in Uganda earlier in Mayon a three-day state visit at the invitation of President Museveni, said Kenya stood to gain from the economic growth of Uganda. President Museveni told manufacturers that Kenya has agreed to buy any extra electric power to be generated by Uganda. "Kenya has promised if there is any excess (power) they will buy it," said Mr Museveni. Presently, Kenya and Rwanda import power from Uganda. In the past few years, Uganda has licensed more than two independent power producers and is increasing the capacity of the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja. "That will be our contribution to East Africa's industrialisation," said Mr Museveni.

On September 21-23, 1998, Kenyan police arrested 22 Ugandans, mostly of Nubian origin, in a national-wide campaign. The arrested Ugandans, whose identities are yet to be established, were arrested at the border areas of Malaba and Busia, and are being detained at the provincial headquarters in Kakamega. Ugandan security officials yesterday said, "We have learnt that some Ugandans were arrested but we have no details on their identities and reasons for the arrests," the top security source said. Kenya Police spokesman, Emmanuel Mwejiti, said that the arrests were not aimed at Ugandans or Somalis. "The Police raided areas all-over the country where criminals conduct their business. The arrests do no discriminate between Kenyans and foreigners. The Police pick any person whom they suspect commits offences, Mwejiti said on telephone from Nairobi. Ugandan security sources said most of those arrested were suspected to be organized from among Ugandan Nubian groups in Kibira estates in Nairobi by rebel groups. They said the groups planned to start rebel activities.

The East African Community was finally revived on 30 November 1999, when the Treaty for its re-establishment was signed by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. It came into force on 7 July 2000, twenty-three years after the total collapse of the defunct erstwhile Community and its organs. Kenya and Uganda have reaffirmed their commitment to enhance and consolidate their historical ties of friendship and the good neighborliness existing between the two peoples, said a joint communique issued on September 22, 2000. After the two-day state visit to Kenya by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at the invitation of his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi, the two leaders issued the communique, saying they pledged to work closely to expand cooperation in the fields of trade, tourism, transport and communications, and energy. They agreed to set up a Committee of Ministers of Finance and Trade to ease trade between Kenya and Uganda, the communique said. Kenya undertook to purchase additional hydroelectric power from Uganda as the latter's generation capacity increases, and the two sides also agreed to complete negotiations by the end of October this year on Uganda's additional supplies of power to Kenya. The two leaders reviewed progress made in efforts to forge closer cooperation among the three east African countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, within the framework of the East African Community. They reiterated the need to expand membership of the community and underscored the importance of regional economic integration and cooperation. Moi and Museveni also exchanged views on recent political development in the region and emphasized the need for concerted regional efforts towards the attainment of durable peace, stability and development in the Great Lakes Region. Museveni arrived in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Wednesday. On that day, he attended the Burundi peace talks here and witnessed the signing of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi by three Tutsi groups.

On September 22, 2000, Kenya entered an agreement with Uganda to purchase additional electricity. A communique issued after a meeting between President Moi and Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni said Kenya undertook to increase the demand as Uganda's generation capacity rises. The communique, read to the Press by Kenya's Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, said the two leaders were motivated by the comparative advantage of using hydro-electric power over other energy sources. "They also agreed to initiate a study on upgrading the transmission lines between the two countries in anticipation of higher loads," the statement said. Earlier reports indicated that the Ministry of Energy was working out a new program to ease power rationing. In the deal, Uganda is expected to increase its supply to Kenya from 30 megawatts to 135MW by 2004. The deal will be sealed later this week. The two leaders also agreed to extend the life of a Joint Co-ordination Commission to finalize the study on extending the oil pipeline from Eldoret to Kampala. On the East African Community, the two Heads of State stressed the need to expand its membership to enhance regional and economic integration. President Moi thanked his counterpart for agreeing to offer temporary accommodation to Kenyan pastoralists and their livestock during the current drought. President Museveni left Nairobi yesterday after a two-day State visit. 

On November 3, 2000, Kenya and Uganda have resolved to extend the Kenya oil pipeline from Eldoret to Kampala. Kenya Energy Minister Mr. Francis Masakhalia and his Ugandan counterpart Ms Syda Bbumba said at the end of a consultative meeting in Kampala on October 13 that feasibility studies for the project would begin in December. The pipeline, with a pumping capacity of 220,000 litres per hour, or nearly one billion litres per year, will save Uganda the cost of transporting fuel by road and rail. Uganda currently consumes 460 million litres per year. "We have not yet decided whether the project will be financed by the two governments or by the private sector, but that will be resolved after studies by the consultants," said Ms Bbumba. Studies conducted in 1995 estimated that extending the pipeline to Kampala would cost $80 million. Establishing the current cost and modes of financing is part the new study. At the end of the talks, the two countries signed two memoranda of understanding: one for the extension of the oil pipeline from Eldoret to Kampala and the other for increased power supplies by Uganda. The meeting also renewed the term of the Joint Co-ordination Committee that oversaw the pipeline extension project. Uganda will increase its power load to Kenya from 30MW to 65MW from July 2005 and to 80MW in July 2006. Details of tariffs and the duration of the contract will be spelt out in an agreement to be signed in mid-November. Sources said Kenya had contracted for less power than had been anticipated because it had several power generation projects currently under construction.

Uganda accounts for a third of Kenya's total exports and was Kenya's largest trading partner largest in the East African region, an East African Community (EAC) report said on December 5, 2002. The report said that Kenya exported to Uganda mainly manufactured consumer goods worth 300 million dollars in 2000, and Uganda exported goods and services worth only 63 million dollars to Kenya during the same period. "Total trade among the three EAC countries-Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda-increased from 403 million dollars in 1999 to 495 million dollars in 2000, an increase of more than 23 percent," the report noted. "The largest volume of trade was between Kenya and Uganda, with Kenya accounting for about 33 percent of Uganda's imports. The report noted that the skewed trade was the result of a well developed private sector in Kenya, while most sectors in Uganda and Tanzania still lagged behind, triggering fears of domination. "This has created a major hurdle to efforts for a quick integration of the region's economies," it said. But it also pointed that there were areas of comparative advantage on which private sector development strategy could be tilted, such as export of hydropower by Uganda to the other two neighbors. The three partner states have a combined population of about 83 million people and gross domestic product (GDP) of some 22.5 billion dollars-8.8 billion for Kenya, 7.9 billion (Tanzania) and 5.8 billion (Uganda). But gap could quickly decrease Ugandan and Tanzanian economic growths have been much higher than Kenya's. Kenya's GDP growth in 1999 was 1.4 percent, 4.8 percent for Tanzania and five percent for Uganda.

Uganda's exports to Kenya increased from $ 22.6m in 2001 to $ 72m in 2002, according to a report released by the Kenyan High Commission in Kampala recently. The report also reveals that during the same period, Kenya's exports to Uganda rose from $ 150m in 2001 to $ 184m in 2002. The report titled 'Uganda's trade with Kenya' says Kenyan exports continue to be dominated by rolled coated iron and steel, Portland cement, petroleum products, paper and paper products, textiles, medical supplies, salt, vehicles and spare parts. The report says these items account for over 50% of Kenya's exports to Uganda. There was an increase in maize, and fruits and vegetable imports from $ 0.02m in 2001 to $ 16.52m in 2002, and $ 0.12m in 2001 to $ 9.39m in 2002 respectively. Cereal export increased from $ 0.05m in 2001 to $ 2.29m in 2002. "The increased exports are partly attributable to food aid for the internally displaced persons in northern Uganda and re-exporting to the Lake Basin region, but demand for most other products remained stable over the two year period," the report says. The report says tea, coffee, fish and fish products, tobacco and tobacco products, motor vehicles and spares, earthmoving equipment, cereal flours, cotton yarn, cocoa and cocoa products dominated Kenya's imports from Uganda. These products accounted for over 90% of Uganda's exports to Kenya. "Fish and fish products are the number one export product from Uganda to Kenya," the report says. The report says the implementation of recently announced measures to curb fish smuggling in the lake will lead to increased exports of fish to Kenya where there is large capacity for processing. In 2002, fish became a leading export item for Uganda fetching over $ 87m. However for most products which Uganda can export to Kenya, Kenya is making inroads in exporting the same to Uganda, the report said.

On June 14, 2003, Kenya and Uganda announced they will launch cross border goods train service. Mr Murungi noted that transit cargo has always been delayed at border points, where the goods trains stop, currently. "Goods trains from Kenya will be stopping in between stations for only inspection purpose," he said. The final destination in Uganda would be Tororo, while in Kenya, it would be Eldoret town. Repairs of bridges on the line between Kampala and Malaba have already commenced, funded by an EU grant of 10m euros. The work, being monitored by the EU, is to be completed in 2005, he said.

On June 11, 2004 it was announced that Kenya and Uganda are working seriously on modalities that will in future ensure cooperation between the two countries to ensure liberalization of the media activities and communication operations. Kenya's Ministry of Information and Tourism will work very closely with Uganda's Ministry of State, Information and Broadcasting to ensure that the media liberalization that had enhanced press freedom was not a mockery to the Fourth Estate. The two ministries will be working very closely in the regulation of radio and television signals and ensuring that the rule of law was observed and that there was not infringement on the rights of other members of the Fourth Estate. Addressing a press conference in Nairobi yesterday, the minister for information and tourism, Raphael Tuju, revealed that the very problems that the Kenyan media was facing were the very problems experienced in Uganda and across Africa. "What I have been doing with the minister for state, information and broadcasting from Uganda is to exchange the frustrations we have been experiencing in the media industry," Tuju said. He expressed concern that modern journalists these days lacked patriotism in the line of duty. The minister also revealed that the two countries were considering prospects of bringing other partners on board to ensure efficiency and accountability as well as adequate exchange of ideas. "We are working on prospects of bringing Tanzania on board so that we can work as a community. We realize that we stand strong united that alone. We have also realized that we have the similar problems facing out media and this require us to sit down and share our experiences," commented Tuju. Decrying the manner in which the media "treated" news materials, Ugandan minister for state, information and broadcasting, Dr Nsaba Butoro, said that information was a very vital tool to the society and challenged journalism to work objectively without fear or favor.

On December 28, 2005, Uganda and Kenya have signed an agreement that will enable the landlocked country to maintain stable oil supplies to avert rampant inflation caused by rising fuel prices. Under the agreement signed between Kenya's Ministry of Energy and Uganda's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, Kenya is committed to increasing petroleum products to Uganda to meet rising demand caused by increased industrial growth. Uganda has registered unprecedented industrial growth this year that has increased oil demand pushing up prices and raising fears of high inflation. Uganda recently also faced temporary shortage of fuel supply after the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) adopted a new policy of collecting tax from petroleum products.

Uganda has an additional demand of 18 million liters of oil per year, which is still expected to increase in 2006. The agreement, also signed by the KRA, Uganda Revenue Authority and the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), provides for enhanced coordination by the two tax authorities and faster clearance of export consignments at Eldoret and Kisumu depots for transit to Kampala. The KPC's chief technical manager Absalom Kosgei said the company had technical and financial muscle to meet Uganda's increasing demand without compromising Kenya's supplies. He said the KPC would meet the new demand by easing congestion at the Eldoret and Kisumu depots and maximizing usage of Nakuru depot, which is operating below capacity. Kosgei said Nakuru, which is distributing 180 million liters of oil every year, was operating at 37 percent capacity. He said Nakuru's distribution capacity would be raised to 550 million liters annually to meet the rising demand.
