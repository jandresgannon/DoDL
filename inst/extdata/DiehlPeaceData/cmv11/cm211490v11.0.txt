COUPMID-CER: MID1321 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: MID1321 from Gibler 2018, after independence in June 1960, the minister of defense of the DRC announced that Belgian officers could serve in the defense ministry but Congolese citizens could not become military officers. (DRC had just gained independence from Belgium.) Members of the military, the Publique Force, mutinied and the mutiny soon turned against Europeans in the DRC. Belgian soldiers engaged Congolese soldiers in various locations in DRC, and the UN eventually got involved to stop the fighting and get Belgium out of DRC. Coded coup MID because members of the military, including a Lieutenant General in the Publique Force, mutinied and attempted to depose the government.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3975 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3975 from NYT 10/30/1991, widespread domestic unrest was occurring in Zaire after the economy crashed. Belgium and France sent soldiers in to evacuate their nationals, and remained in the country even as President Mobutu demanded they leave, triggering this MID. Coded not civil war because the NYT (10/30/1991 and 11/4/1991) does not indicate that rebel groups were among the domestic protests. Some soldiers were looting/extracting bribes from locals, but there is no mention of rebels.

COUPMID-NOTES: MID3975 From NYT 10/30/1991 and 11/4/1991, Zaire experienced domestic unrest in response to anger over an economic crisis. Some soldiers began looting local markets and extracting bribes from various individuala and businesses, but they were not attempting to depose the regime and this bandit activity did not seem to involve any military elites.
