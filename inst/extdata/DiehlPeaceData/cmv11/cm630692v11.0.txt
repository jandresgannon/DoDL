RIVNOTES: In the absence of information about MID2772 (see below) we assume that it is related to the Iran-Iraq war and hence code this rivalry as isolated.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Iran claimed sovereignty over Bahrain on September 21, 1979, and Bahrain rejected the claim on September 22, 1979. On December 13, 1981, Bahraini police arrested 60 members of the *Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain* (IFLB) for their involvement in an attempted rebellion against the government. The IFLB members admitted to being trained in Iran. Bahrain's foreign minister issued a formal protest to the Iranian embassy on December 13, 1981, but the government of Iran denied involvement in the attempted rebellion. On December 14, 1981, the *Gulf Cooperation Council *(GCC) secretary-general and the Qatari foreign minister condemned Iran for its involvement in the attempted rebellion. Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan also condemned Iran and expressed their support for the government of Bahrain on December 14, 1981. Bahrain banned Iranians from the country, suspended economic relations with Iran, and declared martial law on January 8, 1982. Bahrain tried 73 individuals (60 Bahrainis, 11 Saudi Arabians, one Kuwaiti, and one Omani) for subversion beginning on March 13, 1982, and the individuals were convicted of subversion on May 23, 1982. On December 23, 1987, Bahraini police arrested three members of the IFLB for their involvement in planned subversion against the government. The United States announced its decision to provide military assistance (70 Stinger missiles and 14 launchers) to Bahrain in December 1987. Bahrain and Iran resumed full diplomatic relations in December 1990. On February 12, 1996, the GCC secretary-general condemned Iran for its interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain. On June 3, 1996, Bahrain announced that it had arrested 80 individuals for their involvement in an attempted rebellion. The *League of Arab *States (LAS) secretary-general expressed its support for the government of Bahrain on June 4, 1996. Yemen, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, US, and Egypt condemned Iran for its involvement in the attempted rebellion and expressed their support of the government of Bahrain on June 5, 1996. On June 23, 1996, Syria agreed to facilitate negotiations between Bahrain and Iran after Bahrain requested that Syrian provide its good offices. The foreign minister of Syria facilitated negotiations between Bahrain and Iran through July 2, 1996. Kuwait's prime minister expressed its support for Bahrain on July 11, 1996.

NARRATIVE-CR:
One source of long-standing tension between Iran and Bahrain stems in part because of the demographic make -up of the two states. While a Sunni family has ruled Bahrain traditionally, the population is roughly 70% Shiite. In Iran, the population is roughly 90% Shiite. Thus, the revolution in Iran in 1979 caused the ruling family, and the emir great concern. Additionally, Iran attempted to absorb Bahrain by claiming sovereignty over the state in 1979. During the Iran-Iraq War Bahrain supported Iraq, as did its Saudi Arabia. On several occasions during the war Iran was accused by Bahrain of subversive activity directed against the regime in Bahrain. Bahrain accused Iran of training terrorists and insurgents with the aim of destabilizing the Bahraini regime. During the war, Iran actively sought to destabilize Bahrain by training, funding and facilitating subversive activity in the country. The end of the Iran-Iraq War helped to allay some Bahraini fears concerning Iran, but the small Gulf State was somewhat hesitant to embrace Iran. 

MID3617 occurred from May of 1984 until July. This is a multilateral mid involving Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia vs. Iran. Here the issue is the war between Iran and Iraq. Iraq is receiving support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in its war against Iraq. Iran wants to limit that support. They do so by bombing Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf and making it clear that they are doing so in response to the Saudi support of the Iraqis. They widen the bombing to include tankers of all the Gulf States. On 5/17/1984, Iranian warplanes bombed a Saudi oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. This was the fifth such attack in a three-week period. On May 21, 1984, an Iranian newspaper suggested that Iran's air force bomb power stations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to force them to stop supporting Iraq in its war with Iran. Iraq is also bombing Iranian tankers or tankers flagged with other countries that attempt to take on oil at Iranian ports.

MID2587 is a multilateral mid involving Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait vs. Iran. This is a one day mid taking place on 8/29/1986. Here again the motivation for this mid is the squeeze Iran was trying to put on other gulf states in an effort to bleed Iraq dry of cash. Here Iran threatened to close the Gulf of Hormuz that would effectively cut off access to the Persian Gulf and cripple the oil exporting capacity of the Gulf States. 

In 1990, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait precipitates an improvement in Iranian-Bahraini relations. Iran supported the UN resolutions against Iraq and supports the Gulf States positions that included Bahrain. In 1990, the Iranian Foreign Minister paid an official state visit to Bahrain. This visit was reciprocated in the same year. Later in 1990, the two states agreed on a seal link for commerce and travel. In 1991, the states improved relations by exchanging ambassadors as Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic relations with Iran. The states also established more detailed trade links and Iran Air began service to Marana. 

In 1992, Iran established control over Abu Musa, islands that had been shared by Iran and the UAE. This caused a short reconsideration in Manama of the character of relations. They called for a loosening of the sanctions versus Iraq. They spoke out due to concerns Bahrain had about Iran. They felt that Iraq could serve as a bulwark against Iran. Bahrain wanted to run a middle ground course of diplomacy. It wanted to pacify Iran but it also called for attenuation of the sanctions versus Iraq. From 1994 until 1996, there was a general social uprising in Bahrain of the Shiite population. There were protests, demonstrations, and violence. Bahrain blamed Iran, claiming that it had supported and encouraged the unrest. In 1997, relations between the two countries improved dramatically with the election of Khatami. Bahrain followed Saudi Arabia's lead in openness towards Iran in 1998. The two states then began to exchange high-level visits again.
