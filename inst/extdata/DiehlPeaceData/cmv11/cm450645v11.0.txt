NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Liberia and Iraq is wholly a product of the Iran-Iraq War. Both Iran and Iraq put pressure on the opponent's oil assets during the war - especially from 1984 until 1988. Iraq attacked Liberian tankers when they were carrying Iranian oil. Frequently, the Iraqis attacked just after the Liberians had loaded crude oil at an Iranian facility. This period was a dangerous time for any tanker in the region as they were all targets for both Iran and Iraq. In fact Liberian tankers were also the occasional target of Iran during this period. Iraq attacked Liberian tankers in the Persian Gulf numerous times from 1984 until the war's end in 1988. The individual attacks are listed below. The attacks ceased when Iran and Iraq ended their war in 1988. This removed the incentive to attack assets of the opponent. 

MID3046 took place from May of 1984 until July of 1985. This is a series of attacks on Liberian oil tankers. On 27 April, Iraq attacked the Liberian cargo ship the Sea Eagle. The ship was struck by a missile causing and explosion and fire. This occurred about 160 km north of Bahrain. Iraq attacked the Liberian oil tanker Atlanticos on 31 May. The Iraqi air force fired missiles hit the tanker near Kharg Island. On 7 Aug Iraq attacked the Liberian ship Friendship L damaging the engine room crew's quarters. On September 16, Iraq attacked the Liberian merchant vessel, the Med Heron south of the Iranian Island Lalam oil terminal. On October 8, Iraq attack the Liberian super tanker the World Knight. On December 21, Iraq attacked the Liberian ship Magnolia. The attack occurred 50 south of Kharg. Iraq attacked the Liberian tanker Neptunia on 14 Feb 1985. On 10 March, Iraq attacked the Liberian taner Atlanticos again. 

MID3039 occurred on October 8th, 1984. Here Iraq attached the Liberian super tanker World Knight with Exocet missiles 65km south of Kharg Island. The ships sustained severe damage. 

Iraq attacked the Liberian ship Trade Fortitide on 15 March 1988. The attack took place south of Kharg Island and the extent of the damage was unknown (MID2758).
