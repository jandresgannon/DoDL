TERRLINK: MID1331 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID1331 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1331 from Gibler 2018, Western Sahara was claimed by Spain (at this time), Morocco, and Mauritania. Algeria did not claim a part of the territory, but backed the SADR (rebel) government in the territory. In October 1975, Morocco and Spain amassed troops on the Western Sahara border, and Algeria threatened Morocco with war if they crossed into the territory. Morocco and Mauritania reached a secret agreement to divide the territory, putting them on the same side of this MID, with Algeria opposing both of them. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute outside this dyad.
