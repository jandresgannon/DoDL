TERRMID-CER: MID1179 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1179 from cm narrative, Bolivia and Paraguay disputed the border region of Gran Chaco since the 1800s. Here, in January 1906, a minor border incident occurred, triggering this MID. The countries agreed to mediation and eventually signed an agreement in 1907 to prevent further border clashes. The agreement did not hold up. Coded territorial MID because this was a border clash in the disputed territory.

TERRMID-NOTES: from MID-B data, this MID has date 10/1921-12/1921. From Schultz data, the Bolivian government began gradually occupying the disputed area of the Chaco region. Coded territorial MID because this was an occupation of disputed territory. Note that while it is certain that Bolivia was occupying the territory and this should be sufficient to trigger a MID, Schultz notes that there is no evidence of military clashes, and no further info on this dispute could be found in Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016), NYT, Facts on File, Keesings, or cm narrative.

TERRMID: MID1027 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1027 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1027 from Schultz data, this MID is the Chaco War, a war that occurred over the disputed Chaco region.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1211 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIC-2), Bolivia and Paraguay had signed a cease fire, but here, an exchange of military threats occurred over recriminations in the disputed region. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the disputed territory. However, GLM argue that this case should be merged with MID1027 and MID1211. Those MIDs were coded as separate events because they occurred several months apart, but this MID (MID1211) actually occurred between these disputes and therefore erase the period of inactivity that separates those MIDs. Coded uncertain for this reason.

TERRMID: MID2134 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID2134 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2134 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (IIB-20), the Paraguayan military had set up on an international road connected to Bolivia and was apparently harassing trucks. However, the Paraguayan military had authorization to be on this road and no threat to Bolivia was made. There was no evidence that Bolivia perceived the Paraguayan presence on that road as a threat. GLM suggest this case be dropped. Coded territorial MID because Paraguay was using the harassment as leverage during the Chaco territorial/border negotiations, but coded uncertain because GLM suggest this case be dropped since no actual dispute occurred.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1028 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-20), this MID should be dropped. It is coded as a threat in the COW MID data, but GLM find no evidence for this. According to COW, the NYT reported that Bolivian President Toro stated that the Paraguayan occupation of disputed territory could easily lead to clashes, which the COW coders coded as a threat and MID1028. GLM argue that this is a "vague threat at best,” that Paraguay never responded, and that therefore there is no evidence that they perceived this as a threat. Coded territorial MID because this incident, whatever its actual nature, was connected to the disputed territory, but coded uncertain because of GLM's recommendation to drop this MID.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID2135 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-20-21), this MID occurred in the aftermath of the Chaco War - in 1937. Paraguay occupied a road that was on a piece of territory that it had won in the Chaco War, triggering a diplomatic dispute and this MID. Schultz also discusses a series of aggressive actions by the Paraguayan troops on the road. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the disputed territory.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1082 from Schultz data, this MID occurred 9/1937-12/1937 and involved mutual troop buildups in Chaco, despite an agreement that featured caps on the numbers of troops allowed. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the territorial dispute, and the agreement signed at the end of the Chaco war had not led to a decrease in tensions over Chaco.

RIV10333 was originally coded as three separate rivalries, the first two rivalries constituting MID2128 and MID1601 in one rivalry and MID1179 in the other respectively and disputes starting with MID1182 in the last. Yet all disputes involve the same territorial dispute (Gran Chaco) and therefore are combined into one.

Rivalry from riv30 eliminated in riv500 because disputes have been incorporated in other rivalries:

Bolivia and Paraguay signed the *Quijarro-Decoud Treaty* in Asuncion on October 15, 1879, which established the boundary in the disputed region. The countries failed to ratify the *Quijarro-Decoud Treaty*. Miguel Suarez Arana of Bolivia founded Bahia Negra (Puerto Pacheco) in the region on July 16, 1885. Paraguayan troops captured Bahia Negra (Puerto Pacheco) and five Bolivian soldiers on December 23, 1887. Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Paraguay. Uruguay facilitated negotiations between Bolivia and Paraguay, which resulted in the resumption of diplomatic relations on July 31, 1889.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The rivalry between Bolivia and Paraguay involved territorial claims over the Chaco Boreal region that bordered the two countries. The territorial claims were the result of seemingly ambiguous boundaries given to the two states after Spanish decolonization. Because the claims were unresolved at the beginning of decolonization, the rivalry between the two is a continuous one that actually starts as early as 1886, MID2128.

On August 10, 1886 Paraguay re-established a military guard garrison at Fuerte Olimpo in the Chaco which was in Bolivian territory according to an earlier treaty, *Decoud-Quijarro*, signed between the two sides. In December 1887, Bolivia sent its own troops into the territory to prevent Paraguay from controlling the region. Paraguayan troops captured Bahia Negra (Puerto Pacheco) and five Bolivian soldiers on December 23, 1887, MID1601. Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Paraguay. Uruguay facilitated negotiations between Bolivia and Paraguay, which resulted in the resumption of diplomatic relations on July 31, 1889. After another incident over the region in January 1906, MID1179, Foreign Minister Manuel Dominguez of Argentina facilitated negotiations between Bolivia and Paraguay beginning in December 1906, and the parties signed the *Soler-Pinilla Protocol *in Buenos Aires on January 12, 1907.

This rivalry comes to a conclusion in August 1938 when Bolivia and Paraguay ratified the *Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries*, calling for an arbitration by six states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay and the US) to settle the boundary issue. Border skirmishes in June and July 1938 characterize the end of the rivalry in terms of militarized conflict (MID1029 from 6/5/38 to 7/21/38). While the treaty explains a large part of the ending of the rivalry, there are other issues that must be considered, especially given the fact that both Bolivia and Paraguay, along with numerous third parties had tried to settle the issue before as early as 1879 with the *Quijarro-Decoud Treaty* that supposedly establihsed the boundary.

Overall, the Chaco War (MID1027) between the two countries from 1931 to 1935 seems to provide the catalyst for the rivalry termination, leaving each country severly weakened by the other. Prior to and after the war, clashes between the two countries over the border dispute were much less costly in terms of life and money. The Chaco War created casualties that ran from 80,000 to 100,000 dead between the two sides. While Paraguay's defeat of Bolivia and control of most of the Chaco left little left for Paraguay to want to dispute, its victory and subsequent treaty with Bolivia brought about economic crisis along with a rise of nationalism that led to a series of coups and dictatorships bringing the military to power. Economically, the war had cost the country $US 128 million and severly diminshed the country's manpower. Politically, nationalist groups in Paraguay viewed President Eligio Ayala's concessions as too much, leading to his removal from office in August 1936 by a military junta led by Rafael Franco. Franco had also come to power after appealing to a discontent war-weary population. Franco's junta soon fell as well as they were unable to deliver on promises of expropriating land for the poor and being tougher militarily in dealing with Bolivia. In August 1937, the junta suffered a coup by Conservative army officers. Dr. Felix Paiva was placed as interim president. During his presidency, Paraguay signed the permanent treaty with Bolivia, ending the rivalry. In 1939, the Liberal party's Felix Estigarribia was elected as president. In 1940 Estigarribia granted himself dictatorial powers. In 1940 Estigarribia had a new constitution written that would control the anarchial environment brought about by the end of the Chaco War. The constitution rejected laissez-faire economics and delegated most national affairs to the state. A mysterious death in 1940 of Estigarribia led to the placement of General Higinio Morinigo as provisional president. Morinigo forced all Liberals out of the government, replacing them with Franco's former followers along with the Tiempistas, a group of Catholic socialists. Morinigo remained in power until 1946 at which time pressure from the US to democratize led to scheduled elections. Increased competition for power led not to peaceful elections but to a civil war in March 1947 between several different groups (Liberals, Communists, Colorados and Franco's Febreristas). Economically, 1947 to 1955, Paraguay suffered chronic currency depreciation, capital flight and low rates of investment, with inflation averaging over 100 percent a year. In 1948 the Colorado party emerged victorious but not without problems as coup attempts occurred frequently between 1948 and September 1949 when Federico Chaves took the office of president. Chaves and the Colorado party managed to consolidate their power in Parguayan politics and maintained a relatively stable country through 1954. On August 15, 1954, Alfredo Stroessner came to power through a coup after challenging Chaves for control of the Colorado party. Stroessner's regime brought about both political and economic stability to Paraguay albeit in the form a dictatorship and state control that lasted through 1989.

In Bolivia, the old liberal regime was blamed for losing the war, a war that cost Bolivia $US 228 million and the Chaco territory. The financing of the war came through the Bolivian Central Bank that had received loans based on its mining revenues. After the war, the Central Bank's international credit was suspended, leading to widespread inflation. With these large economic troubles, Colonels David Toro and German Busch were able to bring about a coup and institute a form of military socialism for Bolivia in May 1936 and July 1937, respectively. This form of government ended the Liberal and Conservative struggle for power that had left the military out of politics for over 50 years. Under Busch, a new constitution was drafted in 1938, allowing for rights to unionize and strike. These included rights were the administration's attempt to calm a series of labor unrests that brought about general, mining and railroad strikes in May 1936, April 1937, June 1937, March 1938, and June 1938. Cementing Busch's efforts to nationalize the economy, he nationalized the Mining Bank and tightened state control over the Central Bank. Such measures brought about aggressive opposition from the conservative and the extreme left. On August 23, 1939 President Busch died, allowing the traditional Liberals under Carlos Quintanilla to return to power. The brief change of regimes did bring about the emergence of new parties to challenge the liberals and began the fall of the old political regime. These new parties (the Falange, PIR, POR and the MNR) all represented the increasing societal pressure for changes in the country's economy and politics. In 1940, Conservative Enrique Penaranda was elected president. For the next three years, the country became important to the war effort because it was a principal producer of tin. Bolivia's importance led to a $US 5 million loan from the Export-Import Bank. In December 1942, strikes and demonstrations at one mine led to a massacre of women and children causing immediate international attention. In December, the US sent a mission to Bolivia to examine the labor conditions in the mines in an effort to maximize tin production for the war effort. The massacre weakened the Penarnada party and led to its overthrow on December 20, 1943 by Gualberto Villarroel. International recogniton of the government by the US and most Latin American governments was withheld, however, until 1944 due to perceived pro-Axis leanings. On July 21, 1946 President Villarroel resigned amidst growing popular demonstrations and strikes. A military junta took control of the country until January 1947 when Enrique Hertzog was elected president. Growing support of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) in addition to governmental inefficiency and repression led to a civil war on August 26, 1949 initiated by the MNR. The MNR lost the conflict but forced Hertzog to resign. His vice-president, Mamerto Urriolagoitia took office and remained president until 1951 when he lost in May to a candidate from the MNR, Victor Paz Estenssoro. Before the elections were official, Urriolagoitia resigned and left control to General Quiroga who annulled the elections. Economically, Bolivia suffered a severe setback as tin sales were curtailed due to a dispute with the US over prices. In 1952, revolution broke out in Bolivia, led by the MNR. On April 15, 1952 Estenssoro took office as the first revolutionary president signalling MNR victory. Sweeping reforms took place at this point including universal suffrage, mine nationalization, and land reform.

Given such domestic instability in both countries after 1935, it seems that the devastation caused by the Chaco War practically compelled each state to settle the border issue in order to focus on increasingly unstable domestic problems. After the *Treaty of Peace, Freindship and Borders* the countries did seem to focus on these domestic issues. Although their focus hardly resolved the domestic problems, they did at least keep the countries out of conflict with each other.

Bolivia / Paraguay Years: 1886-1938. Issues at stake: Border between Colombia and Peru. End coding: 1938 marks the signing of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Borders, officially ending the Chaco war (1931-1935). The treaty signing followed pre- treaty clashes in 1938. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 8. Last militarized dispute: 1938. Wars: 1931-1935. Summary: The border dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay also has its origins in the inadequate boundary setting of the Spanish. Bolivia believed they had a better claim to the Chaco Boreal region than Paraguay based on certain old Spanish maps and documents. Paraguay was financially unable to garrison the entire region, and Bolivia in 1836 began to explore the Northern Chaco and set up agricultural and military colonies along with missionary posts. However, in 1852 a boundary treaty between Paraguay and Argentina stated support for Paraguay's claim. Bolivia protested this support through the 1850s and 1860s. The stage was set for the beginning of the militarized rivalry between Bolivia and Paraguay in the 1870s. Paraguay went to war against Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay from 1864-1870 (the War of the Triple Alliance). The war left Paraguay occupied by Brazilian forces, and Brazil and Argentina used Paraguay's weakness to settle their border disputes with Paraguay by taking 40 about 55,000 square miles of Paraguay's territory. Brazil wanted to annex Paraguay, but due to conflict between Argentina and Brazil, Paraguay was left as a buffer state. In the course of negotiations leading up final settlement between Brazil and Paraguay (1872) and Argentina and Paraguay (1876), Bolivia's claims to the Chaco Boreal were ignored. In fact, Argentina made a claim to the Chaco Boreal, which was submitted to arbitration by the US. Arbitration found in favor of Paraguay in 1878, but again did not address the Bolivian claim. Thus Bolivia's claim remained officially unresolved. From 1879 to 1883 Bolivia fought the War of the Pacific with Peru against Chile (see discussion above under the Bolivia-Chile rivalry). As a result of the war, Bolivia lost its access to the Pacific ocean. Unable to defeat Chile, Bolivia began to pursue its claims in the Chaco. Bolivian efforts focused on claims to the Rio Paraguay. A port on the Rio Paraguay would have given Bolivia access to the Atlantic; Bolivia claimed that its neighbors were demanding unfair terms to use their ports. The discovery of oil in the Bolivian occupied part of the Chaco made sea access even more important to Bolivia; Bolivia's neighbors refused to give it rights to build a pipeline through their territory. 1886 marked the first of a series of moves by both Bolivia and Paraguay to seize and fortify territory around the Rio Paraguay. In 1879 Bolivia and paraguay had signed the Quijarro-Decaud treaty, which set a frontier through the middle of the Chaco; the treaty was ratified by Bolivia with an additional provision regarding the construction of a port in an "acceptable" location; Paraguay refused to accept the treaty. Paraguay did, however, approve Bolivian construction of a port on the Rio Paraguay. Bolivia began construction in 1885, but approximately 10 kilometers further into Paraguayan territory than approved. In response to this construction and continuing Bolivian claims, Paraguay in 1886 fortified the frontier area, marking the first militarized dispute of the rivalry. Disputes followed through the early 1900s. Further border agreements were signed in 1894 and 1907, but were quickly rejected. In the 1920s both sides sent additional forces into the Chaco to bolster their de facto control. Arbitration efforts by several states and the League of Nations failed from 1928 to 1930. Increased efforts by Bolivia to reinforce its territory and expand its control in 1930 and 1931 led to fighting which escalated to the Chaco War of 1931 to 1935. Bolivia was defeated in the war, and Paraguay was left in control of almost the entire Chaco, although Paraguay did not gain access to the Bolivian oil fields. However, Paraguay was left much weaker than previously, with the value of its currency reduced to about 1/6 of its previous value. Although a truce was signed in 1935, a final settlement was not reached until 1938, and disputes around the border continued. In 1938 the Treaty of Buenos Aires was signed, a treaty of borders, peace, and friendship. In the treaty, Paraguay received about 3/4 of the Chaco region, but Bolivia was guaranteed access to the Atlantic via the Rio Paraguay. Disputes continued until the treaty was signed in July, 1938, centering around certain border areas which changed hands under the terms of the treaty. However, no disputes followed the final treaty ratification in August and the arbitrated resolution of minor remaining points in late 1938. Sources: Goldstein (1992)
