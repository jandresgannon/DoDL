CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3131 from Gibler 2018, during the Rhodesian (Zimbabwe) civil war, Zambia publicly supported the guerillas fighting against the Rhodesian government and hosted rebel bases in Zambian territory. Rhodesia threatened to invade Zambia, and Tanzania threatened to fight alongside Zambia if Rhodesia invaded. Tanzania's threat to join forces with Zambia pulls them into this MID against Rhodesia. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to the civil war in Rhodesia, within this dyad.
