PS-UPDATE2020: Coding change to reflect the onset of a "proxy war" between the two states in which each supports rebels in the other's civil war. The lesser rivarly period dates from the beginning of the Ivorian civil war through the peace agreement in Liberia, which removes the main points of contention between the two sides.
