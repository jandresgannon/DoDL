CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1369 from Gibler 2018, in 1959 East Pakistani (current-day Bangladesh) troops raided a Burmese border village. Coded not civil war MID because there is no indication that this is connected to militarized rebels. Gibler 2018 does not mention rebel activity and the NYT coverage of the event (8/30/1959) does not mention militarized rebels. The NYT coverage does mention that the Pakistani troops looted the village and burned down a police station, so while the pursuit of rebels is one possible reason for the intrusion into Burma, it may also be the case that the Pakistani soliders were not following orders but instead went rogue in this incident. Coded somewhat uncertain because it is unclear why Pasistani troops raided the village, so the motivation/connection for this MID is unknown.
