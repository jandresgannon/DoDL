COUPMID-NOTES: MID2136 from Gibler 2018, President Amin of Uganda put his military on high alert in response to what he alleged was a propaganda campaign by UK, triggering this MID between them. However, most people asserted that Amin put his military on high alert because he was concerned of dissention in the military. No military escalation occurred. Coded not coup because some speculated that Amin put his military on alert because of possibel dissenters in the military, but this does not amount to a coup MID.
