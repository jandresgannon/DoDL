CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2327 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this MID was originally coded as the seizure of a Turkish vessel by Israel in 1976. However, it is unclear why this occurred. It may be the case that Israel suspected the ship of carrying arms to Palestinians in Lebanon. However, this is not certain. GML recommend this case be dropped since the seizure lasted less than 24 hours (a seizure must be for at least 24 hours to constitute a MID) and Turkey did not protest.
