TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4018 from Gibler 2018, China established relations with South Korea in the 1990s, and North Korea resented this, leading to tensions. In 1993, North Korean troops fired at Chinese troops across their border. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the North Korea-South Korea territorial dispute.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4019 from Gibler 2018, in 1995 North Korea fired at a Chinese fishing boat. It is unclear why they did so. Coded not third party link to territory because there is no indication that this is connected to the North/South Korea dispute. North Korea and China had a previous MID that was connected to China establishing relations with South Korea, but (per cm narrative) North Korea and China's relations had been turbulent over recent years for other reasons. It is therefore not clear that the relations with South Korea contributed to this MID. The news coverage of the event does not mention South Korea (BBC 5/20/1995). Coded somewhat uncertain because the motivation for the MID remains unclear.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4089 from Gibler 2018, in 1997 Chinese and North Korean forces clashed near their border. From cm narrative, tensions had been escalated by China's refusal to offer economic aid to North Korea, by North Korea's friendliness toward the Soviet Union in previous years, and by China establishing relations with South Korea. However, it is unclear precisely why this clash occurred beyond it being a product of general tension between the two. The news coverage of this MID does not mention a motivation (BBC 10/31/1997). Coded not third party link to territory because there is no indication that this is connected to the North/South Korea dispute. Coded somewhat uncertain because the motivation for the MID remains unclear.

Between January and April 1993, North Korea provoked a series of 42 incidents with Chinese border guards. Reports indicate that North Korean forces fired more than 700 bullets at Chinese forces. The 42 incidents are only reported vaguely and this dispute is really composed of one incident as a surrogate for those 42 incidents. These incidents occurred in the wake of a deterioration of PRK-China relations that included the suspension of flights between PRK & China and antiChinese broadcasts by PRK. This deterioration of relations began with the establishment of relations between China and South Korea. First day of dispute was on 1/00/1993 and last day of dispute was on 4/00/1993.

North Korea became a member of the international system on September 9, 1948. On May 5, 1949, China's new Communist government signed a mutual defense pact with North Korea. On October 6, 1949, diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. China supported North Korea during the Korea war with more than 1 million troops. The Korean War ended on July 27, 1953. With this date the significant manpower support from China to North Korea ended, too.

On August 15, 1953, China pledged assistance to North Korea to rebuild in the aftermath of the Korean War. On November 24, 1953, the two countries signed a pact for economic and cultural cooperation.

On August 15, 1953, China pledged assistance to North Korea to rebuild in the aftermath of the Korean War. On November 24, 1953, the two countries signed a pact for economic and cultural cooperation. On October 13, 1960, China provided North Korea with a loan of US 100 million dollars approximately. On July 11, 1961, China and North Korea signed the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. This committed China to defend North Korea if attacked. In 1965-1966 the relations between the two countries soured as North Korea took an independent line in the Sino-Soviet dispute. On March 4, 1970, new warmth has become apparent in the relations between China and North Korea. This was the first reconciliation since 1966. On May 28, 1975, China strongly cautioned North Korea not to attack South Korea. On October 6, 1979, North Korea and China's ministers of foreign affairs celebrated 30 years since the establishment of relations between the two countries. China's Communist Party chief, Hu Yaobang, told Japanese leaders on November 24, 1983, that his government has twice told its ally North Korea that increased tension on the Korean peninsula must be avoided. Hu's comments to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone appeared to be a deliberate underscoring of China's new interest in using its weight to keep the divided Koreas from waging any new conflicts. In what seemed an oblique rebuke of North Korea, Hu also deplored the October 9, 1983, bombing in Rangoon, Burma, which killed four South Korean Cabinet officials and other top aides. Burma has declared that North Koreans planted the bomb. Hu did not blame North Korea as the culprit and said that China did not know the details of the explosion. But mentioning the incident at a time when North Korea has been subjected to worldwide criticism for the bombing was itself an unusual bit of finger-pointing. Hu's comments to Nakasone, as described by Japanese officials, indicated that the Korean peninsula will be the main focus of his visit here, one which has taken on the atmosphere of a visit by a head of state. Although technically only the party chief, Hu is regarded by the Japanese as China's second most powerful man and the most likely successor to Deng Xiaoping. In an effort to continue its good relations with China, Japan has invited Hu to meet with Emperor Hirohito and address Parliament as President Reagan did two weeks ago. Besides seizing an opportunity to further good will, the Japanese are eager to explore what they think is a new Chinese initiative to maintain stability between communist North Korea and South Korea, which is linked militarily with the United States and is friendly to Japan. That initiative, the details of which are still murky, was launched on Sept. 28 when Deng suggested to U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger that the United States and Chinacooperate on ways of keeping the two Koreas at peace. In the past, China has rarely discussed with the West its relations with the Pyongyang communist government and, when asked for assistance in restraining North Korea, has insisted that it had no control over that country. In contrast, Hu today brought up the issue with Nakasone and told him that he and Deng had met twice, apparently recently, with Kim Il Sung, the president of North Korea, according to Japanese officials. Hu said that he and Deng had stressed to Kim the importance of keeping stability on the peninsula and had said that "tensions from any source should be avoided," the Japanese officials said. Hu also said that Kim had insisted that his country would never invade South Korea and had insufficient military power to do so, according to the officials. Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said today that Hu's visit would be used as an opportunity to explore details of what they consider an important new initiative on China's part. One key question, they said, is what terms North Korea might insist on to enter any talks that also involve South Korea. Past efforts to arrange unification negotiations between the hostile countries have always foundered on North Korea's insistence that the United States first withdraw its nearly 40,000 troops from South Korea. One Japanese source said it is now believed that the idea of new talks of some kind first came from Kim. Originally, Japan had thought it was a Chinese initiative which had been agreed to by Kim.

On January 25, 1984, North Korea rejected a role for China in the peace talks to put an end to the Korean War. On May 4, 1984, the Chinese Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang made an official visit to North Korea. This is the first time Hu visited Korea since April 1982 when he accompanied Chinese strongman Deng Xiaping to Pyongyang. On August 15, 1986, North Korea and China have agreed to establish first consulates outside their capitals. The source said the agreement called for North Korea to set up its consulate in Shenyang and for China to open a consulate in Nampo, southwest of Pyongyang by the end of 1986. The agreement appeared to reflect the continued importance North Korea attaches to its relations with Beijing although it has been said that Pyongyang has strengthened its pro-Soviet stance in recent years.

North Korea appears to be improving its relations with China after having leaned toward the Soviet Union for several years, West and East European sources said on May 9, 1987. The sources said preparations are being made for a visit to China by North Korean President Kim Il Sung in what appears to be the latest sign of a warmer attitude toward the Chinese. Diplomats said such a visit could come as soon as this month and certainly no later than August. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that he could not confirm that Kim planned a visit to China. Diplomats said this weekend that Kim might want not only to balance more evenly North Korea's relations with China and the Soviet Union but might also seek more Chinese support for North Korea's demand that it be allowed to "cohost" next year's Summer Olympics, to be held in South Korea. Kim would also likely seek clarification from the Chinese on a recent U.S. diplomatic overture toward North Korea, diplomats said. They suggested that Kim also wanted a first-hand look at the direction of domestic Chinese politics. Kim's last visit to China, a low-key, unofficial trip, was in November 1984. This time, the sources said, Kim was insisting on an official visit. An East European source said Kim also wanted assurances that when he met with China's acting Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, during the visit he would be meeting with the man who would ultimately be China's permanent party chief. The Chinese gave Kim such assurances, the source said. China has been encouraging a peaceful settlement of differences between the two Koreas. China, which fought on the side of the North in the 1950-53 Korean War, needs stability on the Korean peninsula so Beijing can devote most of its energies to its economic modernization program, according to analysts here. A western diplomat said a visit by Kim to China might help reduce tensions between the Koreas. In March, the United States informed the North Koreans that it was prepared to take major steps to improve relations if the North resumed talks with the South and agreed to participate in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. U.S. State Department officials said last month that the U.S. initiative was presented to the North Koreans through Chinese officials. Analysts in Beijing said the United States would like to see a lessening of Soviet influence in North Korea. Washington, they said, also hopes that North Korea will not disrupt the Olympic Games, for which South Korea has been preparing at great expense. North Korea has agreed in principle to receive a delegation from the International Olympic Committee, according to committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch. Samaranch said he hoped to send a mission to prepare for a July round of talks among North Korean, South Korean and International Olympic Committee officials, Reuters reported. The United States and North Korea have no diplomatic relations and, until recently, had no official or even informal contacts. But in early March, the State Department disclosed that American diplomats were authorized to talk with North Korean officials when they met at diplomatic receptions. Western diplomats said that several such contacts have taken place in capitals other than Beijing. The United States has been concerned about North Korea's acquisition of advanced MiG23 fighter planes from the Soviet Union and about Soviet naval visits to North Korean ports as well as the use of North Korean air space by Soviet reconnaissance planes. But the North Koreans now appear to be eager to open a dialogue with the United States and may believe that China can be useful to them in facilitating such a dialogue, analysts said. During the past two to three years, North Korea has tilted more toward the Soviet Union than toward China, diplomats said. But a visit by Kim to China might help restore a balance of influence between the two leading communist nations. Diplomats said they detected a warmer North Korean attitude toward the Chinese when Zhu Liang, head of the international liaison department of the Chinese Communist Party, visited Pyongyang in early March.

Relations between China and North Korea have been cooling recently, a Chinese source announced on March 8, 1988, in Hong-Kong. The source cited two things as indicating the cooling of ties. The first one is the suspension of negotiations between Beijing and Pyongyang on China's use of the North Korean port of Chongjin for transport channel between three northeastern Chinese provinces and Japan. The other point cited is China's failure to increase the volume of oil supply to North Korea this year, maintaining last year's level. Bilateral relations have been very close since 1982 and were marked by frequent mutual visits by top-ranking leaders of the two countries.

China pledged continuing close relations with Communist North Korea on October 25, 1990, in a state-approved newspaper editorial that appeared to dash South Korean hopes for formal Beijing-Seoul ties. The two Communist countries will remain "as close as lips and teeth," said the editorial, published in the Communist Party paper, the People's Daily. The editorial marked the 40th anniversary of China sending troops to aid the North in the Korean war. The Chinese intervention prevented victory by American-led U.N. forces fighting on the side of the non-Communist South, and fighting ended in a stalemate in 1953. No peace treaty was ever signed, and the two sides remain formally in a state of war. The past few months have seen new high-level North-South talks, but reunification remains distant. South Korea has openly pressed for diplomatic relations with China and was a major sponsor of the Asian Games held in Beijing this month. But China's Foreign Ministry said last week that its policy of not having political contacts with the South was unchanged. The Soviet Union and other East bloc countries have recently established diplomatic ties with the South while maintaining relations with the North.

On December 17, 1990, China refused to offer financial help to North Korea. China advised North Korea to save itself through economic reform and by opening up to foreign investment.

On October 5, 1991, Chinese Premier Li Peng met with President Kim Il Sung of North Korea and stressed the need for economic reform even while the hard-line Communist nations stay on the path to socialism, news reports said. China has provided few details to foreign reporters about Kim's visit. The government would not confirm South Korean newspaper reports that he planned to stay for 10 days and visit a special economic zone. Kim, 79, the authoritarian leader of North Korea for four decades, is one of Beijing's last remaining hard-line allies. He reportedly is seeking guidance from Chinese officials on setting up an economic zone to attract investment in North Korea. Market-style reforms introduced in China a decade ago have led to relative prosperity in many parts of the country, and Chinese leaders are believed to be urging North Korea to follow a similar course. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that Li told Kim a recent Chinese Communist Party conference concluded that China's state-owned enterprises should become more market-oriented. Despite China's economic woes, it still can offer advice to North Korea, which is in dire need of help to stimulate development because of a stagnant economy and a loss of aid from the Soviet Union. Kim met earlier with Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin. The English-language China Daily said Jiang assured Kim that changes in the world political order would not alter China's relations with North Korea. The newspaper said Jiang also reaffirmed China's support for Kim's proposal to reunite North and South Korea in a confederation that would maintain two governments. China and North Korea have been close allies since 1950, when Chinese troops sided with the North against American-led U.N. forces defending South Korea. But China recently has increased trade and other exchanges with South Korea.

This deterioration of relations began with the establishment of relations between China and South Korea.

MID4019 This dispute consisted of 1 incident in which a North Korean patrol boat fired at a Chinese fishing boat. MID4019 occurred in April 1995. MID4089 occurred on October 25, 1997. MID4089 This dispute involved one incident between China and North Korea. In the dispute, North Korean and Chinese troops in the vicinity of Hyesan near the China-North Korea border clashed, exchanging gunfire.

North Korea's No. 2 political leader arrived in Beijing on June 3, 1999, for the first high-level meeting between the two Communist allies in eight years, talks that will be closely watched by the United States and China's Asian neighbors. The official, Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, brought a large entourage of political, trade and military officials and may also visit Shanghai and Hangzhou. Months in the planning, the talks are intended to demonstrate that the alliance between North Korea and China remains strong. They come just as the United States has made its own offers of cooperation in an effort to moderate North Korea's military and economic policies. During the Korean War, in the early 1950's, China sent troops to help North Korea beat back the advancing Americans, and China has remained determined ever since to preserve the Communist Government there as a buffer on the Korean peninsula. But the alliance has been a tortured one. Even though Kim Il Sung, the North Korean leader at the time, visited Beijing in 1991, the relationship was deeply strained the next year when China bowed to practical reality and recognized North Korea's archenemy, South Korea, with its dynamic economy. More recently, China has been concerned by North Korea's disastrous economic policies, which have forced China to provide large amounts of aid and could cause a social collapse, and by the North's missile tests, which have undermined China's regional security goals. "North Korea is a troublesome ally," said Bates Gill, a military expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "But the Chinese see propping up the regime is their only real option." In the talks this week, North Korea is expected to ask for renewed commitments of the food, energy and other aid that has helped the Government of Kim Jong Il (the son of Kim Il Sung) survive a famine and severe slowdown of its industries. The country's rigidly controlled, closed economy has never recovered from the demise of the Soviet Union and the subsidies and barter arrangements that Moscow provided. China, in turn, is expected to press its secretive ally to moderate its behavior in areas that have threatened China's own strategic interests, appealing to North Korea not to repeat its tests of a new long-range missile. The surprise launching over Japan last fall set off alarm bells throughout East Asia and strengthened Japan's support for developing antimissile defenses with the United States-a development seen by China as a threat. China is also expected to urge North Korea not to develop nuclear weapons, according to a Western diplomat, who said China wants to avoid any increase of tension on the Korean peninsula. China has long maintained scientific and technical exchanges with North Korea, but many Western experts say there is no evidence that advanced weapon technology have been handed over directly in recent years. North Korean sales of missiles to countries like Iran have been a major concern of the United States, and the extent of Chinese influence over such sales is disputed. Chinese officials say they will urge North Korea to begin opening up its economy so it can resume development and reduce its desperate need for outside aid. But China is unlikely to pose any ultimatums that could lead to a serious break in relations or endanger the Communist Government, diplomats say. China publicly endorses cooperation between the two Koreas and the "four party" international talks-including Japan and the United States-on a long-term peace settlement. At the same time, China wants to avoid a total collapse in North Korea, or other scenarios in which South Korea essentially absorbs the North: that would bring an American ally, and possibly American troops, right to China's border. "China doesn't want U.S. forces north of the 38th parallel," said Douglas Paal, an Asia expert in Washington who served on the National Security Council during the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Last week a former United States Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry, visited North Korea, offering economic and diplomatic benefits if the country would agree to abandon its missile and nuclear-weapons programs. There has been no official reply. The two Koreas have also discussed resuming talks on the reunification of families and economic aid, officials in South Korea say.

On May 29-31, 2000, Kim Jong Il visited China and met with president Jiang Zemin and the ruling Communist Party's inner circle. He received promises of free food and other material assistance.

China's defense minister has promised to maintain strong military ties with North Korea as part of the countries' revitalized relations, Chinese state media reported on October 23, 2000. Gen. Chi Haotian's visit to North Korea, China's highest-level mission to its communist neighbor in years, was overshadowed by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's arrival in Pyongyang on Monday. But Chi's presence highlights China's close ties with North Korea even as it breaks a self-imposed political isolation. Chi's five-day visit culminates with ceremonies Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of China's entry to the Korean War on North Korea's side. The 1950-53 conflict is known inChina as the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Chi, now a member of the communist ruling inner circle, is a Korean War veteran.

Shortly after arriving Sunday, Chi told North Korea's defense minister, Vice Marshal Kim Il Chol, that ties between the two militaries were ''a vital part'' of overall relations, China's Xinhua News Agency reported. Chi added that the two armies ''have been maintaining close contacts at all levels.'' Underscoring China's key role in the region's changing politics, Chi expressed Beijing's support for a peaceful Korean peninsula and warming relations between North Korea and South Korea, Xinhua said. China is unique among the major powers, enjoying robust ties with capitalist South Korea as well as its long-standing relations with the North. Although relations frayed in the 1990s, China and North Korea have sought to revive them, most dramatically during North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's secretive visit to Beijing in May. The Korean War anniversary sparked speculation in Beijing diplomatic circles last week that Chinese President Jiang Zemin would soon go to Pyongyang to keep the momentum going. Chi noted to North Korea's defense minister that the Jiang-Kim meeting in Beijing pushed relations into ''a new stage of development,'' Xinhua said. Xinhua did not report if Chi made any mention of North Korea's recent diplomatic forays inviting Albright and opening relations with Britain and Germany. North Korea's state media also did not mention the substance of Chi and Kim's meeting, although it described the talks as ''friendly.'' China is keen to see stability on its borders so that it can pursue economic modernization and would like Pyongyang to reform its torpid economy. North Korea, for its part, has become dependent on donations of Chinese food and oil and credits for trade but needs foreign investment. The defense ministers of China and North Korea promised to maintain strong military ties as part of their countries' revitalized relations, their state media reported.

North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-Il made a six-day visit to the country at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin, the official Xinhua new agency said on January 21, 2001. During Kim's tour, Jiang held talks with Kim at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and hosted a welcome banquet in honor of the North Korean leader, Xinhua said. Prior to the talks, Kim had made a four-day tour of Shanghai, it added.

China has expressed cautious optimism that the dialogue between the United States and North Korea, due to begin in Beijing on April 17, 2003, holds the prospect of a peaceful resolution to the nuclear standoff on the Korean Peninsula. Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said regardless of what form the communication took, China supported dialogue and had no objection to other countries, which may contribute to the process, coming to the negotiating table. As long as the concerned parties were serious about finding a solution, the format was not important, he said. Over the weekend North Korea announced through its state news service that it would agree to negotiate in any format if the US was willing to make a "broad switchover" in its North Korea policy. Until now, North Korea has insisted on talking directly with the US, which, however, wants multilateral talks. The about-face was apparently precipitated by fears that North Korea could be the next target after the quick US military success in Iraq but Chinese analysts also pointed out that North Korea's pragmatism vindicated the patient, behind-the-scenes mediation that China had worked on. "North Korea has made a series of subtle shifts," said Li Dunqiu, director of the Korean Peninsula Studies Association, noting that through frequent consultations China had nudged North Korea to become more pragmatic. At the same time, China used its influence as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council to block a resolution condemning North Korea's withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. North Korea has warned that any Security Council action would undermine peace efforts and it has reiterated several times that it would regard UN sanctions as a declaration of war. The refusal by the Security Council to act on a US request to condemn North Korea paved the way for North Korea to seek to end the nuclear standoff through diplomatic efforts, Mr Li said. Chinese diplomatic sources and analysts said that although China provided substantial amounts of food and fuel aid to North Korea, the extent of its influence on North Korean President Kim Jong-Il's regime had been exaggerated. China has urged North Korea to refrain from brinksmanship, alternating between giving verbal support and applying soft pressure. In an unusual move, China's then-president Jiang Zemin in 2002 openly expressed China's consternation when North Korea dropped out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. China opposed economic sanctions against North Korea throughout the crisis, however. Xu Wenji, an authority on North Korea in Jilin University, said China's quiet diplomacy followed the guidelines, laid down in the 16th Communist Party Congress, that China would build a partnership with neighboring countries. It was also a policy of minimizing China's direct involvement in other countries' disputes and using its leverage judiciously, he said. China had served as venue for diplomatic talks on the Korean Peninsula nuclear crisis for envoys from not only North Korea but also Russia, South Korea and Japan.

Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing will visit North Korea next week, the foreign ministry announced on March 18, 2004. `Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing will visit North Korea from March 23 to 25," said ministry spokesman Kong Quan, without immediately revealing the purpose of the trip. A second round of six-nation talks last month on North Korea's nuclear program failed to resolve differences over a key US demand for the complete dismantling of Pyongyang's nuclear programs. However, it yielded an agreement to establish working groups and to convene again before June.

North Korea's claim that it already has nuclear weapons is likely to reveal how much power China has or will chose to use over its renegade neighbor and ally. China pledged on February 14, 2005, that it would pressure North Korea to return to six-party talks despite North Korea's dramatic statement late last week that it would abandon talks and build up its "nuclear weapons arsenal." In an official statement, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said he had spoken with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and that China will "strive to make the situation develop in a positive direction so that the six-party talks could be resumed as soon as possible." North Korea demanded that the United States withdraw its 37,000 troops in South Korea in order to get nuclear talks back on track. For its part, China is likely to minimize the extent of the crisis even as it leans on North Korea to come back to negotiations, experts on Northeast Asia said. As North Korea's only ally, China is also feeling deeply discomfited in the aftermath of the nuclear claim, and will struggle to resolve the crisis even as Beijing and Washington jockey over competing long-term interests in the region, scholars said. `China's strategy now is to deal with the issue in a low-profile approach," said Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Peoples' University. "China will increase its pressure (on North Korea)," Jin added, and will probe to determine if Pyongyang is simply bluffing about nuclear weapons as a negotiating ploy. If world powers come to believe that North Korea is telling the truth about its nuclear arsenal, then China may be forced to let the matter go to the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions against Pyongyang, policy-makers and academics in Beijing said in interviews in recent months. Like the United States, China wants the Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons to avoid sparking a nuclear arms race in the region. Both nations seek resolution of the current deadlock through the six-party talks China began hosting in 2003, experts said. South Korea's foreign minister, Ban Ki Moon, said that the United States and North Korea could hold some direct talks _ on which North Korea has insisted _ in the course of renewed six-party negotiations. Ban's in Washington for a previously scheduled meeting with Rice on Monday. In an appearance on CNN's "Late Edition," he urged China to use its leverage over Pyongyang to bring it back to the negotiating table. Yet Beijing has a complex and sensitive relationship with North Korea, a nation that has strategic value for China as a buffer state with South Korea, with its large U.S. military presence. Not so many years ago, propaganda here hailed ties between Chinese and North Korean communists as "closer than lips and teeth." "The importance for China of keeping North Korea as a vital partner is rising," said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Peoples University. China has a host of grievances against North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, and has counseled him to open his nation's bankrupt economy to market forces. It also has seen trade ties soar with South Korea to more than $60 billion a year, compared to the $1 billion or so a year it trades with North Korea. But Shi said Chinese military strategists commonly view North Korea through the prism of Taiwan, the island to the south that China considers a renegade province. Tensions along the Taiwan Strait have increased in recent years as China claims the right to reunify with Taiwan by force, an eventuality that few Chinese discount. If China's military should move on Taiwan, Shi said, the Peoples Liberation Army could face a confrontation with the U.S. Seventh Fleet sailing to Taiwan's rescue. In such a scenario, "any strategic diversion that the United States may face is vitally important for China," he said, noting that Beijing at such a moment might spur Pyongyang to cause an eruption of tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Aware of China's complex interests in maintaining a status quo on the Korean Peninsula, the Bush administration has heaped praise on Beijing for serving as host of three previous rounds of six-party talks, which bring together the two Koreas, China, Russia, Japan and the United States. The talks hit a deadlock after a third round last June. U.S. officials say only China can really sway North Korea, noting that as much as 80 percent of North Korea's fuel arrives across its border with China, and that Beijing holds a choke chain on Pyongyang's economy as its only real trade partner. "China's influence in North Korea is not as much as the U.S. side imagines but not as little as China advocates," said Jin Linbo, director of the division of Asia-Pacific studies of the China Institute of International Studies. While China can say things to the Kim Jong Il regime "that other countries cannot say," Jin said, Pyongyang officials resist any measures that might weaken their ironclad political control. Jin said the China and the United States share an abiding interest in preventing North Korea from sparking a nuclear arms race, potentially destabilizing East Asia. "If we fail to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, (a nuclear arms race) is quite possible," Jin said. Both South Korea and Japan might be tempted to seek such weapons, he added. "Japan can develop nuclear weapons probably within months, or even weeks," he said.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Il returned to North Korea on January 18, 2006, after holding talks in China with President Hu Jintao, diplomatic sources and South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency gave the first confirmation that Kim visited China, saying he "paid an unofficial visit to the People's Republic of China from January 10 to 18" at Hu's invitation, Yomhap reported. Kim discussed North Korea's nuclear weapons program and other issues with Hu and other Chinese leaders in Beijing, and boarded his train, the agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying. Diplomatic sources in Beijing also confirmed to Deutsche Presse-Agentur that Kim had visited China and met Hu in Beijing. The Chinese government was expected to confirm Kim's eight-day visit to China. The Chinese foreign ministry continued the diplomatic silence that has kept Kim's stay in China shrouded in secrecy, despite widespread news reports of the trip by media outside China. Ministry spokesman Kong Quan repeated his earlier assertion that he was "not authorized" to discuss the issue. China only confirmed Kim's previous known visits to the country in 2004, 2001 and 2000 once the reclusive leader had left, saying this policy was requested by North Korea. Kim spent several days secretively touring southern China, apparently visiting high-technology industries over the weekend in Shenzhen, a special economic zone that pioneered China's economic reforms in the 1980s. His latest visit comes as six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program have reached a critical stage. Pyongyang has demanded that the United States drop financial sanctions before negotiations can resume. Washington has rejected the demand. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher made an unscheduled return to Beijing to hold further discussions with Chinese officials on the nuclear talks. Hill, who led the U.S. team in the last round of six-party talks, met Chinese officials nut did not plan to meet any North Korean officials, a U.S. embassy spokeswoman said. On Tuesday, North Korea again said that the U.S. sanctions were the "main obstacle to the progress of the talks." Communist-ruled China remains one of the few allies of North Korea, providing vital food and energy aid.

China has described its relationship with North Korea as one that is "as close as lips and teeth." With North Korea's announcement that it tested a nuclear device, its "teeth now bite China's lips," said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at People's University in Beijing, on October 10, 2006. China angrily denounced the apparent test as "brazen" in a statement and demanded that North Korea stop any action that could worsen the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula. The statement was a departure from the normally diplomatic tone that China's government adopts when talking about North Korea. Even so, Chinese President Hu Jintao told President Bush in a phone call that the issue should be resolved through negotiations, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. China called for a return to the six-party talks it has hosted since 2003 in an attempt to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The talks among North and South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States have been suspended for more than a year. North Korea, which wants the United States to end financial sanctions, has boycotted the talks. "The six-party talks aim to remove North Korea's nuclear weapons, but it is a mission impossible," said Shen Dingli, a foreign policy analyst at Fudan University in Shanghai. North Korea appears bent on pursuing its nuclear ambitions regardless of international pressure, Shen said. Foreign governments, including the United States, have long hoped that China's political and economic ties with North Korea would translate into useful leverage. North Korea gets about 70% of its food and 70% to 80% of its fuel from China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. David Straub, a consultant and former State Department official, said "the Chinese are used to being slapped by the North Koreans" despite all the aid China has provided over the years. Fearful of being dominated by its wealthier and more powerful neighbors, North Korea has sought to be unpredictable and often acted the ingrate, he said. Some experts say North Korea's insular regime is not susceptible to economic pressure. Shen said North Korea's regime could survive famine even if millions died. "North Korea is a sovereign independent country, and, very importantly, the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il is a very unique character," said Chen Fengjun, director of the Korean Peninsula Research Center at Peking University. China's ties with North Korea extend to the Korean War, when up to a million Chinese soldiers died while supporting the North. In recent years, China has tried to exercise its influence by attempting to convince travel-shy Kim of the benefits of opening up his country's economy-while retaining a strict one-party state. The reclusive dictator has even toured the Shanghai Stock Exchange. In the past few months, attitudes have hardened in North Korea. After the country fired test missiles in July, China "wanted to have direct talks with Kim Jong Il to exchange ideas on this issue, but they refused," said Shi Yongming, a North Korea specialist at the China Institute of International Studies, which is linked to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. China's relationship with North Korea will be tested further in the coming days as the United Nations Security Council debates its response. "I think our government will support sanctions, but only on terms concerned with missiles and nuclear technology, not including food for the people and economic assistance," Shi said. "If the sanctions are wider, and the North Korean government couldn't survive, there could be chaos in North Korea, and that is dangerous for both China and South Korea."

China's trade with North Korea remains unaffected by the North's nuclear test, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on October 31, 2006, defending the trade as a way to improve the lives of ordinary Koreans. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao characterized China's trading relations with North Korea as normal and said they were not disrupted by the October 9 nuclear test. "China has normal trade with the DPRK, which has been continued," Liu said at a briefing, using the acronym for North Korea's formal name. China is North Korea's main trading partner, accounting for more than half the North's total trade, and its main supplier of oil. Beijing has been under pressure from the United States, even before the test explosion, to use this economic leverage to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs. Liu suggested that China's refusal to use trade as a diplomatic pressure would continue, saying that it benefited ordinary North Koreans. "China and the DPRK have normal trade relations which are aimed at people's livelihoods and at helping people overcome economic difficulties," Liu said. "I do not have any news that the policies will change." China has, however, been willing to use some economic levers to show North Korea its displeasure over the test. China signed on to a U.N. resolution prohibiting trade in military materials and luxury goods. It has stepped up inspections of some cargo across their shared border and restricted banks from conducting some transactions with North Korea. Liu sidestepped questions about foreign media reports that said China reduced shipments of oil in September, a period when tensions were on the rise amid suspicions that North Korea might conduct a nuclear test. He said trade was normal in September, though he did not address whether China might have curtailed deliveries of subsidized fuel, rather than those at market prices. Liu made clear that Beijing remained committed to negotiated solution, calling for a resumption of the disarmament talks that North Korea has boycotted for a year and that also include the United States, Japan, Russia and South Korea. "It's imperative to resume the six-party talks and through these talks push ahead with the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and address the concerns of different parties," Liu said.
