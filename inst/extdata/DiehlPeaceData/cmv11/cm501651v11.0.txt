TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3010 from Gibler 2018, in 1978 Egypt, en route to Somalia, violated Kenyan airspace. In response, a few days later Kenya intercepted and downed an Egyptian plane carrying ammunition to Somalia. Egypt was supporting Somalia in their war against Ethiopia. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the war between Somalia and Ethiopia, and that war was a territorial war.
