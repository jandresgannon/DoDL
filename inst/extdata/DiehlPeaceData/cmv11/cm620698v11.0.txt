CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3098 from Gibler 2018, in 1981 Libya raided Sudanese territory in a series of attacks on anti-Chad rebels located in Sudan. Libya was supporting Chad in its civil war. Coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebels in Sudan/Chad, outside this dyad. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not recognize Oman as a party to this dispute.
