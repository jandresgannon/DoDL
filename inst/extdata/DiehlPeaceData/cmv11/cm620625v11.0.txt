CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2138 from Gibler 2018, Libya was transporting troops and ammunition to assist in Uganda's war against Tanzania. Per the cm narrative, this war was connected to Tanzania allowing rebels opposing the Amin regime in Uganda to use its territory. The Libyan planes entered Sudanese airspace, and because Sudan was trying to mediate an end to the conflict, it downed the planes in Sudan. Coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Uganda, outside this dyad.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The beginning of tensions between Libya and Sudan occurred on September 21, 1972, when the Sudanese government prevented five Libyan air force planes from flying troops and arms to Uganda to join in the conflict between Uganda and Tanzania. This was MID2138.

Sudan accused Libya of involvement in an attempted military coup against President Mohammed Gafaar Numaryi on July 2-3, 1976. Sudan severed diplomatic relations with Libya on July 6, 1976. Colonel Muammar Qaddafi of Libya denied involvement in the attempted military coup on July 15, 1976. The rivalry between the two countries was based upon Libya's continued interventions into the domestic affairs of the Sudanese government over the next 8 years as Co. Qaddafi attempted to undermine all African governments, including Sudan, that he viewed as pro-Western. Libya and Sudan agreed to resume diplomatic relations on February 8, 1978. 

The Sudanese government survived another coup attempt sponsored by Libya in 1979. Egypt requested assistance from the United States. In response, the United States sent 12 F-5 planes to Sudan for protection. This is MID3001.

Sudan proposed expelling Libya from the *League of Arab States* (LAS) on March 24, 1981 after Libya's military intervention in Chad. President Numaryi called for neighboring countries to "overthrow or kill" Colonel Qaddafi on March 31, 1981. Sudan order the Libyan ambassador and diplomatic staff to leave the country on June 25, 1981. Major-General Umar Mohammed al Tayib, vice-president of Sudan, accused Libya of subversion on October 4, 1981. Sudan claimed that in the latter part of 1981, Libyan forces and planes were raiding Sudanese border towns along the Chad-Sudan border as part of Libya's incursion into Chad. These air raids are designated MID3098.

The United States deployed four AWACS (airborne warning and control system) surveillance aircraft in Egypt in support of Sudan on February 17-23, 1983. This was MID3072.

MID3065 occurred in August of 1983, when Libya claimed that Sudan had sent troops to fight along side forces from Chad against Libyan forces.

In August 1983, Libya attacked northern Chad, just west of Sudan with the purpose of gaining a better corridor to stage attacks against Sudan. This was MI3065.

The US and Egypt accused Libya of planning to overthrow the Sudanese government. Libyan military aircraft bombed a radio station in Omdurman, Sudan on March 14, 1984, resulting in the deaths of five individuals. The US deployed two AWACS surveillance aircraft in Egypt in support of Sudan on March 18, 1984. This was MID3051. It marked the final MID between the two countries. In April 1985, President Nimeiry of Sudan was overthrown, satisfying the basis for Qaddafi's interventions into that country. This domestic change appears to be the reason for the termination of the rivalry between Libya and Sudan.

Libya became independent on December 24, 1951. Sudan became independent on January 1, 1956. Between 1967 and 1971 Libyan-Sudanese relations had been based on a positive foreign policy relationship with both nations favoring solidarity with other Arab countries. However, during the early 1970s President Gaafar Nimeiry of Sudan began to pursue a foreign policy strategy which aligned Sudan with Western powers. Sudan's western focused policy conflicted with Libyan interests. On November 17, 1969, the Sudanese president, al-Nimeiry, made an official visit to Tripoli, Libya, where he met with Libyan officials. A timetable for the economic integration of Libya, Sudan and Egypt was agreed upon on April 20, 1970 between the three states. Under the agreement, the three countries will lift import custom fees, grant freedom of transport and transit, and assure freedom of entry, work and residence for each other's citizens. Initially, Libya supported Sudanese President Jaafar an Numayri against an unsuccessful leftist coup attempt in 1971. Libya turned over two of the top communist plotters to the Sudanese authorities, who executed them shortly afterward. 

19850708-19900707 Transition

On July 8, 1985, Sudan and Libya have signed a military assistance agreement allowing Libya to provide equipment and training for the Sudanese army, navy and air force. The newspaper quoted Sudanese Defense Minister Major Osman Abdalla as saying Libya will supply transport aircraft and surface-to-air missiles to Sudan as a result of the pact, signed last weekend in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The agreement followed Abdalla's disclosure the previous month that Sudan was seeking to ''diversify'' its military suppliers to prevent the country from becoming totally dependent on one source. The United States is presently the only source of supply for Sudan's military. Abdalla, commenting after returning to Khartoum from Tripoli, denied the agreement was a first step toward a union between the two countries-which has been proposed by Libya. ''Libya has no intention of forming any strategic alliance with Sudan or of interfering in Sudan's domestic and foreign policies,'' Abdalla said. Abdalla said Sudan decided to sign the accord after Libya assured the government it had ceased all support for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the largest rebel force battling the government in the southern section of the country. Libya had been a major supplier of arms and money to the SPLA, which operates from bases inside Ethiopia. ''Libya has ceased extending support to (SPLA leader) Col. John Garang, his Sudan People's Liberation Army and any other organization bent on anti-Sudan activity,'' Abdalla said. ''On the contrary, the Libyans are making personal endeavors to convince John Garang to come to negotiations under Libyan sponsorship,'' he said. Since the military seized power in Sudan in a bloodless coup April 6, 1985, Garang has refused offers by the new regime of a cease-fire and a Cabinet post in the new government. Abdalla ruled out Sudan would act as a mediator between Libya and Egypt, Sudan's major ally. Libya broke diplomatic relations with Egypt after the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, known as the Camp David accords. ''Libya has made its position clear that it would not restore relations with Egypt until Egypt renounces Camp David,'' Abdalla said. ''Sudan has no role to play as a mediator between the two,'' he said. Diplomats said Egypt has been extremely worried by Sudan's new relationship with Libya. Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained because of Egypt's refusal to extradite former President Jaafar Numeiry, deposed in the April coup, to face trial in Sudan on corruption and treason charges. Sudan's civilian Prime Minister Al-Gizouli Dafalla said Sunday the government will try Numeiry in absentia if Egypt refuses to extradite him.

Sudan and Libya have signed an agreement for the Sudan to buy Libyan oil with money withheld from Sudanese workers in Libya, Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi of the Sudan said on August 10, 1986, after a short visit to Tripoli. In 1985, Libya expelled thousands of Arab workers or blocked their paychecks, saying it was reducing dependence on foreign labor because of adverse economic conditions. It was Mr. Mahdi's first trip to Libya since he took power in May, 1985, after winning a general election in April, and another sign of better relations between the two countries since President Gaafar al-Nimeiry of the Sudan was ousted in 1985. 

On December 6, 1988, Libya and Sudan have agreed to strengthen their economic cooperation by promoting trade, setting up joint ventures and establishing a joint bank. An agreement to the effect was reached during the talks between Sudanese officials and visiting Libyan defense minister colonel Abu Bakr Yunis, who ended his week-long visit to Sudan. Under the agreement, Libya will supply Sudan with more than one million tons of oil annually for two years. After that Libya would increase its oil export to Sudan so that the value of oil could cover that of camels Libya imports from Sudan, said Sudan's information minister Abdullah Mohamed Ahmed. Both sides have agreed to set up a joint venture oil company to ensure Libya's oil supply to Sudan. Libya will also help Sudan train students specialized in oil industry and provide technicians in this field. The two countries also planned to establish a joint Sudanese-Libyan bank with initial capital of 50 million US dollars and cooperate in textile and food industries.

Libya will continue to provide military aid to the new government and fresh military hardware will reach Sudan in the near future, said a member of the 15-man ruling military junta in Sudan on September 25, 1989. Brigadier Al Tijani Adam Taher, a member of the Sudanese revolutionary command council, made the statement on his return from Tripoli after a four-day visit. But he gave no details of Libya's arms aid in his statement. In July, 1985, Sudan and Libya signed a military cooperation agreement under which Libya was to provide Sudan with transport equipment and anti-aircraft weapons and to train personnel for the Sudanese armed forces. However, the agreement was declared no longer in force by the government of former prime minister Sadeq al-Mahdi after it agreed to hold peace talks with the Sudan people's liberation army (SPLA). The Mahdi regime was overthrown in a coup on June 30, 1989. The new military junta refuses to abrogate the military pacts signed with Libya and Egypt in the past while insisting on having talks with the SPLA for the settlement of the six-year civil war in the south. Taher said that Libya also agreed to supply oil to Sudan in accordance with an agreement signed in 1988, under which Sudan was to get 50,000 to 70,000 tons of oil per month totaling 250,000 tons by the end of 1989.

19900708-20140905 0.5

A ministerial council set up to discuss a political and economic merger of Sudan and Libya will hold its first session on July 8, 1990. Twelve ministers from each country will be represented on the council, which was created when Sudanese military leader Gen. Omar al-Bashir visited Tripoli in March 1990. Al-Bashir, who seized power in Sudan in 1989, and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi declared they intended to merge the two countries in pursuit of the goal of Arab unity, and opened their common border to visa-free transit by each others' citizens.

Oil-rich Libya has pumped millions of dollars of aid into Sudan, the largest country in Africa, which is impoverished despite its reserves of oil.

The 12 Libyan representatives on the council will arrive in Khartoum. ''The meeting is expected to review means for the realization of solidarity and unity between the two countries and for the utilization of their economic potentialities in all spheres and to invest them for the benefit of the two peoples,'' the newspaper said. An integration charter drawn up by the two governments at the time of al-Bashir's visit to Libya has not yet been signed, despite predictions in the official Sudanese media that its ratification would go ahead on June 30, the anniversary of al-Bashir's coup. Western diplomats have expressed doubts about the seriousness of the planned merger, describing it as a Sudanese bid to strengthen economic ties with oil-rich Libya. Libya has tried unsuccessfully before to merge with its neighbors, most recently with Chad.

Sudanese premier General Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, chairman of the command council of the ruling national salvation revolution, emphasized on November 6, 1991, that integration between Sudan and Libya and the establishment of a common market are steadily progressing. At a meeting with the heads of media organizations and Islamic leaders in Khartoum, al-Bashir said that during his recent visit to Libya, he had witnessed a great deal of enthusiasm that reflected the desire of Libyan leader Muammer al-Gaddafi on the completion of all integration establishments and ventures, as well as Libya's readiness to provide the necessary hard currency to Sudan to finance these projects. He denied the rumored rupture of oil agreements with Libya, describing them as "unfounded." In a related development a 40 million US dollar trade exchange agreement was concluded the same day between Sudan and Libya. Under the agreement, Sudan will export to Libya 10,000 tons of mutton and 22,000 camels beginning from the last week of November 1991. Sudan and Libya are seeking to establish integration over the past couple of years, and several joint ventures have been formed. Libya is the first exporter of petroleum to Sudan.

The state minister in the Sudanese Ministry of Social Planning, Colonel Yousif Abdel-Fatah, told the Akhbar al-Yom daily on August 8, 1995, that the relationship between Sudan and Libya was stable. Colonel Abdel-Fatah made the statement in the wake of press reports originating from Egypt that relations between Sudan and Libya were getting chilly. He said that in his capacity as chairman of the Sudanese wing of the Forum for Arab Revolutionary and Democratic Dialogue he had met with the Libyan charge d'affaires in Khartoum who invited him to attend the 26th anniversary of the Libyan September 1 revolution. The Sudanese official said Libya had also invited a large popular delegation including chiefs of some Sudanese tribes to participate in the Libyan national day celebrations. "The Libyan diplomat praised the Sudanese stand in Arab and international affairs especially our rejection of the western conspiracies against Libya," Abdel-Fatah told the Khartoum newspaper.

A Libyan official arrived in Kahrtoum on November 13, 1995, with a message from the Libyan leader Moamer Gaddafi to Sudanese President Omar Beshir, the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. The Libyan secretary general for unity, Juma'a al-Fazani, would deliver the message to General Beshir, it said. The content of the message was not disclosed. The Libyan leader recently met with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Tripoli and observers here think the message may have to do with the Libyan attempt to reconcile the two neighbors. Sudan accuses Uganda of supporting the current offensive by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in southern Sudan. Another point that may be of concern to Sudan and Uganda is the plight of the 300,000 Sudanese being expelled from Libya. Sudan is supposed to move these Sudanese out of Libya by the end of this year but the difficulty of transporting them by land through the desert routes makes it impossible to get this number out of Libya by the end of December 1995. 

A senior Libyan government official who arrived in Khartoum said on January 3, 1996, that his visit was part of Libya's attempt at mediation to end border tension between Sudan and two of its neighbors. Abu Bakr Yunus Jabir, described by the radio as a member of the Libyan leadership council, was speaking after a meeting with Sudanese President Lieutenant Omer Bashir. He said relations between Libya and Sudan were solid and deep, and his visit was also to join in Sudan's independence celebrations and those to mark the convening of the first national congress. He said his meeting with the Sudanese president was part of Libya's effort to end border tensions between Sudan and Eritrea and Uganda and, despite the existence of mutual misunderstanding between Sudan and Uganda, those involved had not rejected this mediation.

Sudanese nationals who took refuge in the Sudanese consulate in Tripoli following their escape from a camp in Libya set up to hold "illegal immigrants" will be transported home by the Sudanese government, the Foreign Ministry said on August 13, 1996. A statement said some Sudanese nationals were among the 400 foreigners who escaped from the camp of illegal immigrants and took refuge in the Sudanese consulate. The statement said with the help of the Libyan authorities the situation at the consulate was under control and that the embassies of the countries whose nationals took refuge at the Sudanese consulate had agreed to transport their nationals to their countries. In 1995, when Libya decided to expel all foreigners illegally living in the country, the Sudanese government said there were about 300,000 Sudanese nationals affected by the expulsion order. About half of them managed to return to Sudan by the first half of 1996. Some expellees staying behind could not afford to pay their transport back home. The Foreign Ministry said it would be closely monitoring the situation.

On February 5, 1997, Sudanese Vice-President Gen. Zoubeir Mohamed Salah conferred with the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi in Tripoli, as part of Khartoum's diplomatic offensive in the wake of a worsening military situation in the southern part of the country. Sudanese government troops and civilian volunteers are currently battling to fight off an offensive by an alliance of exiled Sudanese nationals, who have seized several locations in the Blue Nile province. The Libyan News Agency reported that Gen. Salah conveyed a message from Sudanese president Omar Hassan Al-Bashir. JANA said the message dealt with the situation in Sudan, Khartoum's worsening relations with its neighbors and bilateral issues. Sudan has in recent times repeatedly accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of supporting rebels fighting government forces in the country's southern and eastern parts. Khartoum also accuses Egypt of being involved in an "American-Zionist" conspiracy aimed a overthrowing Gen. al-Bashir's regime by encouraging the secession of southern Sudan. Egypt and the other neighboring states have denied the allegations, saying the situation in Sudan was basically an internal affair. Gen. Salah's visit to Libya is part of his country's diplomatic move to secure the support of Arab states in its strained relations with the four neighboring states.

On April 26, 1999, Sudanese foreign minister Mustapha Osman has commended Libya's efforts to find a solution to the dispute hindering the development of relations between Sudan and Eritrea. In a public statement Osman expressed support for these efforts, saying they are the "most appropriate way" of settling all the disputes between Khartoum and Asmara. During the occasion of the Community of Sahelian-Saharan States (COMESSA) summit held on 14 and 15 April in Syrte, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadhafi arranged a meeting between Presidents Omar Hassan Al Bashir of Sudan and Issaias Afeworki of Eritrea. Sudan and Eritrea have expressed their willingness to positively respond to Kadhafi's efforts and endeavor to eradicate all the causes which led to the severing of their diplomatic relations. Eritrea was admitted as the seventh COMESSA member at that summit in Syrte. The sub-regional organization has now grown to eight members: Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Libya, Mali, Niger and Sudan. Niger, however, was suspended from COMESSA after the assassination of President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara in a coup d'etat recently.

On August 10, 1999, President Omar Hassan l-Bashir of Sudan has commended Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi, for undertaking initiatives aimed at reconciling the government and opposition in Sudan. "Libya is the only country which presented to us an efficient initiative", al-Bashir noted, specifying that his government has accepted the Libyan peace plan which is favorable to the maintenance of unity in Sudan. Khartoum-based newspapers printed large excerpts of President Bechir's speech which mostly dwelled on Libya's proposal of the holding of a conference involving the government, the opposition, all other political forces as well as trade union organizations in Sudan to reconcile. No date was announced for the meeting. Sudanese foreign affairs minister, Mustapha Ousmane Ismail, told reporters in Khartoum that his country relies on Kadhafi's peace efforts to "reach a definitive solution in the conflict between the government and the opposition." He said that in-depth consultations were underway between Libya and all the parties to the Sudanese conflict. Libya's plan provides for an immediate end to military operations, media campaigns, the opening of direct dialogue between the government and the opposition, followed by the formation of a committee to prepare for negotiations. Kadhafi, who has been attempting for a few months now to reconcile the Khartoum government and all opposition political forces in the country, had talks last week-end with the leaders of the Democratic National Alliance, a joint structure of the northern and southern opposition. Kadhafi also touched on the situation in Sudan during talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at Marsa Martrouh, in north-eastern Egypt. Mubarak is also making efforts toward achieving national reconciliation in Sudan. A civil war has raged in Sudan since 1983 with the North-Arab and Muslim-against the South, mainly populated by Christian and animist majority. In 1995, the northern opposition took up arms in turn to overthrow the Khartoum regime.

On October 31, 1999, Sudan's Foreign Affairs Ministers Mustapha Ousman Ismail arrived Saturday in Tripoli for a visit the duration of which was not specified. Ismail said he carried a message to Col. Moammar Kadhafi from Sudanese President Omar Hassan el Bashir on the consolidation of bilateral relations and on-going consultations between the Sudanese government and the opposition based on the Libyan-Egyptian peace initiative. The Leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, Col. John Garang, told the Libyan leader on the telephone that his movement supported the Libyan-Egyptian initiative as a step towards national reconciliation in Sudan.

The first batch of 96 Sudanese nationals escaping unrest in the Libyan region of Azzawya arrived by road on October 9, 2000, at the western city el Fashir, near the border with Chad, official sources said in Khartoum. The official news agency reported that the returnees were from the Northern Darfur and Southern Darfur states in western Sudan and Gedarif in the east. Addressing the returnees, Northern Darfur Governor Sharif Mohammadain expressed the hope that after being forced to leave Libya, they would contribute to the country's development process. He said a high-level committee had been formed to cater for their return to their home areas, saying the state was prepared to accommodate more people fleeing from Libya. He added that the government would make arrangements for the restoration of their belongings left behind in Libya. Meanwhile, Khartoum daily Sahafi I Dawli (international pressman) wrote in a report from el Fashir that the 96 returnees were in bad shape and psychologically upset. The newspaper said about 3,000 more were on their way to el Fashir and were expected to start reaching the area soon. It quoted some of the returnees as saying many Sudanese citizens were killed in the Libyan carnage. Thousands of others had escaped death by running for safety in the Sudanese embassy in Tripoli or in makeshift camps built by the Libyan authorities.

The president of Sudan, Staff Lt-Gen Umar al-Bashir, received in his office on June 27, 2002, the secretary of the General People's Committee for African Unity, Dr Ali Abd al-Salam al-Turayki. The meeting touched on ways of joint cooperation and coordination between Khartoum and Tripoli, in the regional and international scene, particularly through the Sahel-Saharan Community. Al-Turayki reiterated his country's commitment to realize peace and stability in Sudan. For his part, the president of the republic commended the active role of the Jamahiriyah in bringing about stability in the African continent.

On December 1, 2002, the minister of foreign affairs, Dr Mustafa Uthman Isma'il, has underscored the efforts exerted by the leader of the Libyan revolution, Col Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi, to remove the tension between Sudan and the Eritrean regime, stressing that Sudan just wants the Eritrean regime to change its behavior in dealing with its neighbors, give concern to its own internal problems and totally abandons intervention in Sudan's affairs. 

The President of Sudan, Staff Lt-Gen Umar al-Bashir, received on 17 March, 2003, the secretary of the Libya People's Committee for African Unity, Abd-al-Salam Al-Turayki, and discussed the situation in the Arab area. In a press statement after the meeting, Al-Turayki said that the meeting discussed progress of the bilateral relations between Sudan and Libya as well as the trilateral cooperation between Sudan, Libya and Egypt. Al-Turayki said that Libya has attended the Comesa meeting as observer, adding that his country has applied to join Comesa with full membership. 

Sudan's president met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on May 3, 2003, for talks on bilateral relations, Libya's state-run news agency reported. Omar el-Bashir was accompanied on the one-day state visit to Libya by Sudan's foreign and defense ministers, the official Sudan news agency reported. No further details were available and el-Bashir later departed Libya for Sudan. Neither leader spoke to reporters. Sudan's official newspaper, al-Anba, reported earlier that el-Bashir was expected to meet in Tripoli with his Eritrean counterpart, Isaias Afewerki, for talks aimed at easing Sudanese-Eritrean tensions over charges each nation shelters rebels fighting the other's government. There was no word on any el-Bashir-Afewerki meeting taking place. Afewerki was not believed to be in Libya. Libya's Minister for African Affairs Ali Abd al-Salam al-Turiki told The Associated Press that Libya is not mediating between Sudan and Eritrea. Khartoum accuses the Eritrean regime of assisting the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army in southern Sudan as well as northern Sudanese opposition groups, which Eritrea denies. Sudan hosts several Eritrean opposition groups who accuse Afewerki of starving his people to support a military buildup and claim responsibility for guerrilla actions inside Eritrea. 

Libya has proposed a draft constitution for a tripartite union of Libya, Sudan and Egypt, a press report said in Tripoli on May 4, 2003. The proposal came during the brief visit by Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to Tripoli, the official SUNA news agency quoted Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail as saying. The Libyan side led by President Moamer Kadhafi put forward for discussion with the Sudanese delegation headed by Beshir a draft constitution for unity of the two countries and Egypt, Ismail said. The Sudanese promised to give its viewpoint on the matter after thoroughly studying the draft constitution, he added. The minister said the two leaders had a closed-door meeting and a plenary one during the unscheduled visit in which they discussed the peace process in Sudan and the security situation in west Sudan's Darfur region. The two leaders discussed the current tension in relations between Sudan and Eritrea but "did not concentrate on this issue as it was not one of the objectives of the visit," said Ismail, denying a meeting between Beshir and Eritrea's Issaias Afeworki, noting that the latter was not in Libya. The two sides also discussed the bilateral cooperation and integration agreements and related projects, said Ismail. He added that Assistant President Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, who is in charge of Sudanese-Libyan integration programs, and International Cooperation Minister Yousuf Tekenah stayed behind in Libya to discuss reactivation of the integration projects between the two countries.

Khartoum announced on June 5, 2003, that it has completely closed its border with Libya, according to a decree issued by the minister of internal affairs, Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn. The minister said the decision to close the border with Libya was taken to ensure the safety of Sudanese and their property and the two governments' efforts towards road safety. The decree directs the customs department to restrict the movement of Libyan vehicles currently in Sudan, and assemble them in Dunqula town northern Sudan until their safe return to Libya is ensured.

Sudan asked Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi on August 17, 2004, to "intervene personally" in the escalating crisis in Darfur, Libya's official JANA news agency reported. Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail delivered the request from President Omar al-Beshir at a meeting with Kadhafi in the central town of Sirte, the news agency said. "President Beshir is pleased with Colonel Kadhafi's opposition to foreign intervention in Darfur and asks him to help settle the crisis in the region and assist in the repatriation of refugees," JANA quoted Ismail as saying. African Union-sponsored peace talks between the Sudanese government and the Darfur rebels are supposed to be taking place in Nigeria the following week. But the previous week, Libya hosted informal talks in Sirte which brought together Khartoum and the two Darfur rebel movements as well as representatives of the African Union and neighboring Chad, which hosts the lion's share of Darfur refugees. At the time, a Chadian source expressed concern Libya might be trying to seize a bigger role in the peace process. "We are afraid it will be taken over by Kadhafi at the expense of the African Union," the diplomat said. Libyan has strongly opposed foreign intervention in Darfur warning the previous week that it could spark another Iraq-style conflict.

On 6 September 2014, Libya expels Sudananese military atache after accusations of Khartoum flying weapons to aid Islamist rebels in tripoli.

2014 the civil war in Libya had been transformed into a proxy war, which pitted Islamist forces supported by Qatar, Sudan and Turkey, against more secular forces supported by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt [and probably the United States]. Field commander Ashraf El Hasi accused Khartoum of supporting the Libyan militias, and using the airports of Sirte, Tripoli, and Masrata to supply weapons to the militants. El Hasi said in September 2014 that Sudan attempted to enter a convoy of vehicles carrying Yemeni fighters into Libya. He stated that the convoy was detected at the border town of El Kufra. He reported that a convoy of vehicles loaded with militiamen crossed the Libyan-Sudanese border at El Kufra in support of the Libyan Islamist insurgents.

On 06 September 2014, Libyan authorities announced the grounding of a Sudanese military aeroplane at El Kufra airport, "laden with weapons bound for rebels". They claimed that the transport aircraft was heading for Tripoli's Mitiga airport, then under the control of a Islamist militia group. Sudan described the incident as a misunderstanding. The week before, the Sudanese military attaché in Tripoli was declared persona non grata, after he had been accused of supporting Libyan militia groups.

The presidents of Egypt and Sudan agreed 19 October 2014 to support the Libyan military in its fight against armed militias in the country following two-days of talks in Cairo. Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir agreed to co-ordinate efforts to achieve stability in Libya through supporting state institutions, in particular the army. The chaos in Libya is one of Egypt's main foreign policy concerns, following cross-border attacks by fighters who control parts of the country's east, including oil-rich Benghazi. Libya's new government accused Sudan of arming "terrorist groups" operating on its soil, a charge Khartoum denied.
