CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire (Congo) was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. The Zaire government received money and arms from the French government. Coded civil war link because this is connected to a civil war in Zaire, outside this dyad. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not identify Congo Brazzaville as part of this MID.
