MARITMID-NOTES: MID2845 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-29), Chile fired warning shots at US fishing vessels when the boats refused to leave Chilean waters. GLM recommend this case be dropped because the US boats were private vessels (not military vessels, therefore not a show of force), and the US did not protest the incident, meaning this does not meet the criteria for being a militarized incident. Coded not maritime because the border was not disputed. Coded uncertain because GLM recommend this case be dropped.

NARRATIVE-CR:
While the disputes between the US and Chile in the 19th century occur close in time to each other, they do not seem to constitute a rivalry since they are not over any coherent set of issues between the two countries. On August 20, 1857 a Chilean navy ship arrested a US ship in its territorial waters, MID1496. In 1883, the US along with the UK, Italy, and France sent warships to Chile to protect their interests during the War of the Pacific, MID1517. In December 1891, US soldiers of the U.S.S. Baltimore were arrested for fighting with Chileans during shore leave in Valparaiso, MID1512.
