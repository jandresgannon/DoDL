CIVWARMID-CER: MID4302 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4302 from Gibler 2018, Liberian rebels were attacking from Guinea, seizing workers and towns. Liberia closed the border, and Guinea placed troops on the border. Soon thereafter, ministers from member states of the Economic Community of West African States announced they would form a border commission to address the problems on the border. Later, Guinea accused Liberia of attacking three of their villages. Guinea and Liberia agreed to a non-aggression pact and to exchange security information to end this MID. Coded civil war MID because the border closed and had troops placed on it due to Liberian militarized rebels attacking Liberia from Guinea.
