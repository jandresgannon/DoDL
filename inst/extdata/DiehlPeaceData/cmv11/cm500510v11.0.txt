CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1382 from Gibler 2018, domestic unrest in Uganda led Amin to accuse Tanzania, Sudan, and Zambia of preparing to invade Uganda in 1974. Tanzania and Uganda then amassed troops on the border, and Uganda threatened the aforementioned countries with military force should they invade. From New York Times 11/11/1974, part of this unrest involved a small group of Ugandan troops that rebelled against the rest of the military and the regime due to a lack of pay and food. The rebellion was quickly put down. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved troops in the military rebelling against the regime; these are organized, militarized rebels.

COUPMID-NOTES: MID2140 from Gibler 2018, in 1977 Amin sensed that he was in danger of losing control of Uganda to elements of his military and losing support internationally. He then accused Tanzania of preparing an invasion of Uganda and threatened force. Clashes did not occur. Coded not coup because although Amin feared losing support from his military, there is no indication here that a coup/rebellion by the military was actually imminent.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2141 from Gibler 2018, Uganda, expecting an invasion from Tanzania, preemptively invaded Tanzania in 1978 and started a war between the countries. Tanzania sought to topple the Amin regime and re-install the former Ugandan president to power. It fought alongside rebels in Uganda to pursue this goal. Libya intervened on behalf of Amin in Uganda, but ultimately the rebels seized the capital and Amin fled to Libya. Coded civil war MID because this involved militarized rebel activity in Uganda.

COUPMID-NOTES: MID2141 Idi Amin had been ousted from power in 1978, after taking power in a coup in 1971 (per Gibler 2018). Amin and Tanzania were antagonistic while he was in power, and the Ugandan-Tanzanian War in 1978-1979 led to Amin being forced to leave power for fear of being captured by Tanzanian forces. Although Amin took power via coup in 1971, this war was connected to the antagonism between their regimes, and not particularly to the fact that Amin took power via coup seven years earlier.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The basis for the rivalry between Uganda and Tanzania was the regime of Idi Amin. After he overthrew President Obote, Tanzania opposed his leadership through military interventions.

President Milton Obote of Uganda and 1,000 soldiers fled to Tanzania following his overthrow in a military coup led by General Idi Amin on January 25, 1971. This was the beginning of MID1380. General Amin closed the border between Uganda and Tanzania on July 7, 1971. Tanzanian troops and Ugandan troops clashed near the border on August 24, 1971. Ugandan military aircraft attacked a Tanzanian military base on October 20, 1971. Some 100 Ugandan and 50 Tanzanian troops were killed during the crisis.

Some 1,000 Ugandan rebels (supporters of former President Obote) invaded Uganda from Tanzanian territory on September 17, 1972, but the troops were defeated by Ugandan troops on September 19, 1972. Uganda military aircraft bombed the villages of Bukoba and Mwanze, Tanzania on September 18-22, 1972, resulting in the deaths of 24 Tanzanians. Some 230 Ugandan rebels, 150 Ugandan civilians, and 33 Ugandan government soldiers were killed during the conflict. This is MID1381.

President Amin accused Tanzanian President Nyerere and Zambian President Kuanda of spying on July 13, 1974. This is MID1382. Tanzanian and Ugandan troops amassed along the border in the following days, but by August 2 the tensions appeared to be reduced. Ugandan military aircraft dropped a bomb on the village of Kihumulo on December 26, 1973, resulting in the death of one Ugandan civilian. On November 5, 1974, Uganda claimed that Tanzanian military aircraft had violated its airspace on November 4-5, 1974. 

On February 17, 1977, the Anglican Arhbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga-Zaire was killed in an automobile accident just hours after being accused of helping in a plot to overthrow President Amin along with Ugandan exiles from Tanzania. Amin then claimed that Tanzanian invading forces were assembled six miles off the Ugandan border on March 2, 1977. This was MID2140. No invasion was actually reported in this case.

Uganda accused Tanzania of invading its territory on October 11, 1978, but Tanzania denied the accusation. Some 3,000 Ugandan troops invaded Tanzania on October 27, 1978. President Amin announced the annexation of the Kagera Salient on November 1, 1978. This is MID2141. Tanzanian troops launched a counterattack against Ugandan troops on November 11, 1978. Some 20,000 Tanzanian troops and Uganda National Liberation Front (UNLF) rebels invaded Uganda from Tanzania on January 20, 1979. The government of President Amin was overthrown on April 10, 1979, and Yusufu Lule was proclaimed president by the UNLF on April 13, 1979 shortly after the Libyan intervention force that had been defending his regime left the country. President Amin fled into exile to Libya. Some 3,825 individuals were killed during the conflict, including some 375 Tanzanian soldiers, 1,500 Tanzanian civilians, 150 Ugandan rebels, 1,000 Ugandan soldiers, 500 Ugandan civilians, and 300 Libyan troops. Some 10,000 Tanzanian troops remained in Uganda through June 30, 1981.

Once Idi Amin was removed from power in Uganda though, the basis for the rivalry was eliminated. Regime change is the root of the termination of this rivalry. This is clear in that there has not been a continuation of fighting between the two countries since that domestic change.

Tanzania became independent on December 9, 1961. Uganda became independent on October 9, 1962. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have made two attempts to unite in a regional organization since they gained independence. In each case, the nations sought a loose federation underpinned by an economic common market. In 1961, the three countries formed the East African Common Services Organization (EACSO), in which a shared and centralized administration was to provide services, including transportation, communication, tax collection, scientific research, social services and university education. The EACSO charter was also to create a common currency, a common appellate court, and a common market in which goods and labor could circulate freely. These were to be directed by a central legislative assembly. By 1965, the EACSO began to come apart due to growing tendencies toward nationalism and diverging economic and political policies. It never accomplished what it set to accomplish: an economic common market and it was finally ended in 1967. On December 1, 1967, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania formed the East African Community, an attempt to save the common market in place since 1961. Even though the EAC was supposed to promote even stronger relations between the three countries, the animosities that led to the change from the EACSO to EAC were still present and blocked any significant developments towards an integrated East Africa. The first MID of RIV1109, MID1380, lasted from January 27, 1971 to December 25, 1971. President Milton Obote of Uganda and 1,000 soldiers fled to Tanzania following his overthrow in a military coup led by General Idi Amin on January 25, 1971. President Obote was in Nairobi, Kenya when the coup occurred and was ordered out of the country by the Kenyan authorities. Tanzania received him and his soldiers who fled from Uganda. This was the beginning of MID1380. General Amin closed the border between Uganda and Tanzania on July 7, 1971. Tanzanian troops and Ugandan troops clashed near the border on August 24, 1971. Ugandan military aircraft attacked a Tanzanian military base on October 20, 1971. Some 100 Ugandan and 50 Tanzanian troops were killed during the crisis.

The last MID of RIV1109, MID2141 ended on June 3, 1979. Once Idi Amin was removed from power in Uganda though, the basis for the rivalry was eliminated. Regime change is the root of the termination of this rivalry. This is clear in that there has not been a continuation of fighting between the two countries since that domestic change. During the period 1979-1981 Tanzanian troops remained in Uganda as peacekeepers at the request of the new Ugandan regime. Tanzania decided to withdraw all its troops in summer 1981, at the end of the two years defense agreement between the two countries, even though the Ugandan leadership wanted the Tanzanian troops to remain in Uganda. 

On December 14, 1979, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Uganda signed two agreements under which Tanzania will provide Uganda with defense and police forces at Uganda's request to strengthen her defense and security during the next two years. At the end of the two-year period Uganda will be at will to terminate the agreements if the Government of the Uganda National Liberation Front considers itself capable of ensuring its defense and security. The Police force agreement was signed by the Minister for Home Affairs, Ndugu Hassan Nasor Moyo, on behalf of Tanzania, and the Ugandan Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Paulo Muwanga. The defense agreement was signed by Ndugu Moyo, as Acting Minister of Defence and National Service, and the Ugandan Deputy Minister for Defence, Lt-Col Omaria. The Principal Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ndugu Julius Matiko, told newsmen after the signing ceremony that the two accords were not a threat to any country, nor are they military pacts. 

On April 28, 1981, Tanzania announced the start of a total withdrawal of its 10,000-strong security force from Uganda despite last-minute appeals from the Kampala government. Ugandan officials in Kampala had no immediate comment on the Tanzanian move, which diplomats said could only further weaken President Milton Obote's already shaky hold on the country. Uganda, a land-locked East African nation of 12 million, has been racked with terrorist and guerrilla activity, deep political divisions and dire economic difficulties ever since the 1971-1979 reign of Dictator Idi Amin. The Tanzanian army, which invaded Uganda in April 1979 to help depose Amin, has since served as a peace-keeping presence by performing many police duties and holding the ill-disciplined Ugandan army of 6,000 in check. Radio Tanzania reported Tanzanian Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Abdallah Twalipo told residents of the town of Mwanza, on the Tanzaian side of Lake Victoria, to prepare to welcome the first contingent of returning soldiers on May 1, 1981. He said the last Tanzanian soldiers will be home by the end of June, according to the radio, when the two-year defense agreement between Tanzania and Uganda expires. Ugandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paulo Muanga, accompanied by chief of defense forces Maj. Gen. Tito Okello, traveled to Dar es Salaam over the weekend for talks with Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. Tanzanian government officials said privately the Ugandans appealed to Nyerere to allow some troops to remain beyond June. Failing that, they wanted Tanzanian officers to remain to command units of the Ugandan army. Nyerere turned down the request, the officials said. They said it was costing Tanzania $4 million-$5 million a month to keep its troops in Uganda. Under the terms of the defense agreement, Uganda is supposed to pay Tanzania the entire cost. But Tanzanian officials say four successive post-Amin governments have failed to pay anything at all. ''We're a small, poor country ourselves,'' a high-ranking Tanzanian official said. ''We've done more than our share for Uganda.'' Tanzania originally sent 45,000 troops into Uganda in 1979 but withdrew 35,000 shortly after Amin fled. Some 10,000 Tanzanian troops were withdrawn from Uganda by June 30, 1981. Tanzanian troops who helped overthrow Ugandan dictator Idi Amin completed their withdrawal from Uganda on June 30, 1981. Most of the 10,000 soldiers still in Uganda when Tanzanian President Julius K. Nyerere ordered them home eight weeks ago arrived at the port of Mwanza after crossing Lake Victoria. President Nyerere left only 1,000 police officers in Uganda. Tanzanian troops first crossed the border in January 1979, fighting their way to Kampala where they oversaw the installation of a new government in April of that year. Some 45,000 Tanzanian troops were in Uganda at the height of the fighting.

On April 29, 1982, the Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Picho Owiny, has hailed the role Tanzania is playing in promoting regional and continental unity and spearheading the freedom struggle for the oppressed people. The Minister was speaking at a reception marking the 18th anniversary of the founding of the United Republic of Tanzania. He paid tribute to President Nyerere and his Government for steering Tanzania's prosperity and consolidating her independence and economic well-being, based on the policy of self-reliance. He reaffirmed Uganda's continued fraternal relations with Tanzania, which are sealed in blood. 

The Uganda and Tanzanian Government have agreed that what Tanzania owes Uganda shall go for the settlement of recognized-financial claims by Tanzania against Uganda, and that in cases where Tanzania paid the eight creditors of the former East African Community in excess of their liabilities, the portion of the sums will be regarded as sums paid by Uganda to the same creditors. This was contained in an agreement signed in Kampala on February 28, 1984, between the Tanzanian and Ugandan Governments after concluding bilateral discussions held in Jinja from 21st February to 23rd February 1984. Minister of Regional Co-operation, Mr Sam Tewungwa signed on behalf of the Uganda Government, and the Tanzanian Minister of Finance and Treasury, Mr Cleopa Msuya, signed on behalf of his Government. This agreement is a result of talks that were held by the three East African Heads of State in Arusha on 16th and 17th November 1983, where the three Presidents made important decisions on the question of dividing the assets and liabilities of the former East African Community. Arising out of the formula for dividing these assets and liabilities in the proportions of 42 per cent to Kenya, 32 per cent to Tanzania and 26 per cent to Uganda, Kenya realized excess assets and so did Tanzania; Uganda realized a shortfall. Speaking before signing the agreement, the Tanzanian Minister of Finance and Treasury, Mr Cleopa Msuya, said that now that the two countries had concluded the bilateral discussions, they should start thinking of grounds for future co-operation and regard this as a matter of the past. Mr Msuya affirmed that the excess assets owed to Uganda by Tanzania will be compensated accordingly, and hoped that the bilateral talks between Kenya and Uganda shall be completed soon.

Uganda and Tanzania have worked out an emergency transport program to move the backlog of Uganda's goods now lying at Dar es Salaam port of Tanzania. Under the program announced in Kamapala on September 21, 1988, the emergency operation will start to transport 3,200 tons of Uganda's dry cargo via Tanzania per week and clear about 27,000 tons of the piling Ugandan goods at Dar Es Salaam port in nine weeks. The Uganda railway corporation will have four locomotives inside Tanzania operating between Mwanza and Tabora for hauling wagons loaded with Uganda's cargo. The program was worked out by visiting Tanzanian Minister of Communications and Works Mustapha Nyangayi and his Ugandan counterpart Ruhakana Ruganba. According to a joint statement signed by the two ministers, their talks also focused on the investment requirements for the transport infrastructure of the route linking Uganda to Tanzania's Indian Ccean port of Dar Es Salaam, cooperation of air transport between the two countries and the proposed Arusha-Musoma railway project. The proposed railway project, if carried out, will provide Uganda with a new railway line to Tanga port of Tanzania. Uganda and Tanzania signed an agreement on transport cooperation last June during the visit to Tanzania by Ugandan third deputy prime-minister Abubakar Mayanja. At present, more than 70 percent of Uganda's imports and exports are handled through Mombasa port of Kenya.

Tanzania and Uganda will give special attention to their trade relations at a meeting of the joint commission of the two countries to be held in Kampala on October 21, 1988. According to a statement issued by the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry, the two-day meeting is expected to discuss all possible areas for cooperation and find ways and means to expand the existing areas of cooperation between Tanzania and Uganda. They will include tourism, transport and communications, agriculture, health, education and culture. Landlocked Uganda uses Tanzania's Dar Es Salaam port to handle its imports and exports. Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya used to be partners of the East African Community which collapsed in 1977. Leaders of the three countries reached an agreement at a summit meeting in Arusha, Tanzania, in 1983, agreeing to establish diplomatic relations at the high commission level, thus opening up a new era of East African cooperation. Presidents of Tanzania and Uganda have exchanged visits as part of their efforts to improve their relations.

On December 29, 1997, Uganda and Tanzania were trying to promote mutual trade between the two countries. Tanzania Harbors Authority (tha) is setting up a special cargo handling center at Dar-es-Salaam port for Kampala-bound goods from earlier 1998. Uganda's exports to Tanzania are averaged at 2.2 million US dollars in 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 financial years while its imports from Tanzania are averaged at 8 million US dollars during the two years, official figures indicated. It is possible to balance the trades by increasing the export from Uganda to Tanzania.

Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania are finally set to sign a treaty to set up a common market, but critics are skeptical about the protocol's chances of success. During a summit in Arusha on November 29, 1999, in northern Tanzania, Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, Kenya's Daniel arap Moi and Tanzania's Benjamin Mkapa are to sign the treaty forming the East African Community (EAC), which is to lead eventually to political federation, according to a communique issued by the EAC secretariat. The treaty comes after two and a half years of difficult negotiations, and its signing has already been postponed twice, in November 1998 and July 1999. Even now, the text has not been fully finalized. Critics point to huge disparities among the three economies as a cause of skepticism over whether a common market of the region's some 83 million consumers-32.4 million in Tanzania, 30.3 million in Kenya and 21 million in Uganda-will succeed.

Uganda and Tanzania have both voiced fears that Kenya will alone benefit from a common market at their expense. Kenyan industry is far more developed than Tanzania's and Uganda's, and Kenya enjoys a significant trade surplus with both its neighbors. Bilateral trade with Uganda is in Kenya's favor by a ratio of 1 to 20, according to Kampala. Negotiators have been pressing Kenya to accept a zero tariff on imports from Uganda and Tanzania, while Kenya would initially have to pay duties on imports from its two partners. The delegates say they have finally reached agreement on this crucial point. "We hope we will benefit from the common market, from zero tariffs," Tanzanian foreign ministry spokesman Charles Mwakangata told AFP. If it is in fact launched, the new community will replace the East Africa Cooperation, which was formed in November 1994 to regulate tariffs and trade practices and to facilitate the freedom of movement of persons, goods and capital. Like previous efforts, that entity-which also went by the acronym EAC-was a failure. In the early 1960s, the three countries set up the East African Common Services Organization, then in 1967, a first East African Community, which was scraped in 1977 without really having functioned as a result of major political and economic tensions. Now that all three countries have adopted the free market practices prescribed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the climate for union appears more favorable. However, a Kenyan opposition member of parliament, Mukhisa Kituyi, complained during a parliamentary debate on the treaty last week that no precise framework has been worked out merely for setting up a customs union, the first of many steps towards federation. According to the EAC communique: `Establishment of the customs union will be gradual, on the basis of a protocol that will be signed within four years. Then the establishment of a common market will be in phases, according to a time line that is to be approved by the (EAC) Council of Ministers."

On January 27, 2000, Tanzania announced that so far it has received 9.6 million US dollars from the Uganda government in compensation for the costs involved in the 1978/1979 war against Idi Amin, the then Uganda's President. The Deputy Tanzania's Minister for Finance, Prof. Crispin Haule told the on-going Assembly in Dodoma, that the money had been disbursed to the Ministries of Defense and National Service and Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He said the total debt the Uganda government was supposed to pay Tanzania amounted to 123.2 million US dollars as per contract between the two countries, signed on September 23, 1998. He told the house that out of the amount, 64.39 million US dollars had already been verified and the remaining 58.8 million US dollars was still being verified. Prof. Haule said further that the amount still under verification emanated from 35.1 million US dollars worth of surplus commodities and interests from the debt. According to him, the government would look into the possibility of compensating victims in the regions where the war against Idd Amin was fought. Apart from deaths, the Tanzania-Idd Amin 1978/79 war had left thousands of Tanzanians, especially residents of Bukoba and Mwanza regions, homeless and property less. These are the northern Tanzania regions bordering the two countries, Tanzania and Uganda. The war had also caused a country-wide famine, high inflation, and other economic hardships, whose effects are still in place to-date and they include accumulation of foreign debts.

On September 26, 2000, Uganda and Tanzania got close to resolving a long-standing border dispute along the southern part of the country in Mbarara district. Mr. Ngoma Ngime, the Mbarara resident district commissioner, said that the disputed stretch of land at Kamwema has reverted to Uganda. "Surveyors from Tanzania and Uganda worked jointly through last month to come up with a conclusion that the disputed area belonged to Uganda," he said. The Uganda and Tanzanian officials were unclear on who owned the estimated four-kilometre land between Kikagati in Mbarara and Karagwe, Tanzania. "The Tanzanians thought their border extended up to Kikagati and would confiscate cattle from our herdsmen," a Police officer said. Ngoma Ngime said only a small tract of the post-independence boundary reverted to Tanzania.

On 3 June, 2002, Tanzania has asked President Yoweri Museveni's government to pay up the 31m dollars costs that Tanzania incurred during the 1979 war that ousted President Idi Amin Dada. Sources said last week that members of the high-powered Tanzania delegation that was in Kampala in April for celebrations to mark the fall of Idi Amin raised the issue of the unpaid debt. President Benjamin Mkapa, the Chief of Staff of the Tanzania army, Maj-Gen Mwamunyange and the commander of the Tanzania troops that ousted Amin, Gen D B Musuguri, were among those who attended the celebrations in Kampala. The initial debt was 123m dollars, which has reduced to about 31m dollars. A Uganda government official who requested anonymity said Kampala "feels it has paid enough. We don't have money for drugs and they want us to give more money. If Italy can waive our debt, our Tanzanian brothers can also do the same," he said. In a 1998 agreement brokered by donors anxious to see the country settle its bilateral debts, Dar es Salaam agreed to reduce the debt to 95m dollars, which was to be paid in cash and grants. Uganda has reportedly paid 64m dollars so far. But the two countries have reportedly failed to agree on the balance owed with Kampala claiming it is less than 31m dollars. Dar says the Tanzania People's Defence Forces spent the money on the war against Idi Amin's regime. The money included soldiers' pay, equipment and training for the various Uganda fighting groups opposed to the Amin regime. There has in the past been talk of compensating victims in Tanzania's Bukoba and Mwanza regions, which bore the brunt of the fighting.

On March 17, 2003, Tanzania and Uganda have reached an agreement to resolve their 24-year old border dispute. Kagera Regional Commissioner Major General Tumainieli Kiwelu told The East African last week that the agreement was reached at a recent meeting held in Mbarara, Uganda. Among the objectives of the meeting was to work out modalities of moving Ugandan citizens with their cattle and the no-man's-land issue. Maj Gen Kiwelu said that the major issues were the repatriation of Uganda citizens who entered Tanzania illegally; replacing destroyed border beacons; and dealing with cattle from Uganda which were grazed on Tanzanian territory. He said the meeting agreed that, by April 4, all illegal Ugandan immigrants should have left. As has happened along the border between Tanzania and Rwanda, unplanned settlements and cattle overgrazing have contributed to environmental degradation in Tanzania. Maj Gen Kiwelu said that, in order to clearly demarcate the no-man's-land, the current distance of 15 km between beacons should be reduced: "We agreed to reduce the distance to between two and five kilometres," he said. In January, Tanzania and Uganda were once again on collision course when a boundary beacon at Bubare village was destroyed by unknown people. Tanzania also claimed that some Ugandan citizens had constructed their houses on its territory. Efforts by the two countries' officials to resolve the dispute were frustrated when a technical committee appointed to remap the boundary aborted in June 2000. Tanzania was unhappy with some of the issues raised by Uganda in a meeting between the two side at Mutukula, Tanzania. At the time, Uganda claimed that the boundary passed some 300 metres inside its territory. Some border beacons were removed by Amin's soldiers during the 1978/79 war. Amin had made similar border claims. Soon after the aborted June 2000 meeting between Tanzania officials from the Ministry of Lands and Uganda's Ministry of State, Uganda claimed that there was a "one latitude that passes 300 metres inside" its territory. However, Tanzania on its part dismissed the claims as baseless, saying the argument that the one-latitude passed 300 metres inside Uganda territory was yet to be lodged officially. The June 2000 meeting advised Uganda to write an aide memoire stating clearly that it was disputing the present border. 

Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has sent congratulatory message to his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni on October 10, 2003, for the 41st anniversary of Ugandan independence. In his message, Mkapa said that Tanzania joins with the people of Uganda in the commemoration of the Independent Day. The president said that the cooperation between Tanzania and Uganda will be further enhanced for the benefit of the two countries and African continent as a whole. Uganda and Tanzania were former British colonies in eastern Africa, and Uganda gained independence in 1962 and Tanzania in 1961. Both countries are now the members of Eastern African Community.

President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda on February 2, 2004, held talks with President Benjamin Mkapa at State House, Dar es Salaam, where they discussed various issues, including economic and political ones. Speaking to journalists immediately after meeting President Mkapa, President Museveni said the issues were beneficial to both countries in bringing about development. However, the Ugandan leader refused to say what these things were, saying they were confidential and that a statement would be issued at the right time. Regarding security along the Tanzania-Uganda border in Kagera Region western Tanzania, President Mkapa said teams from both countries were working well together and that there were no problems. President Museveni was in the country for a one-day visit.

Tanzania and Uganda reiterated on February 2, 2004, the protocol for establishing a customs union of the East African Community (EAC), which comprises the two and Kenya, would be signed on February 16, 2004. This was announced by Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa and his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni at a joint news conference after their meeting. Mkapa said the long-expected customs union would broaden economic and trade cooperation among the three countries so as to give an impetus to regional integration. The signing of the customs union protocol had been postponed twice. It was first scheduled for Nov. 30 last year and then for Jan. 16, which also proved premature. Explaining the postponement, Mkapa said ministers and experts from the three countries were now ironing out the remaining differences, which he called minor matters, so as to prepare a clear-cut document for the Feb. 16 EAC summit. Answering a question on whether belonging to different economic blocs would hinder their cooperation, Museveni said the three-country integration would not be affected by their marks of other economic bodies. Museveni paid a one-day working visit to Tanzania. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, all Swahili-speaking countries, have long dreamed of a common market which they believe will stimulate product and services cooperation and revitalize cross-border trade. However, uneven levels of economic development have slowed the process.
