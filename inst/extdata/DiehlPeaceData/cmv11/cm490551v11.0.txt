NARRATIVE-CR:
The relationship between Zambia and Zaire has been conflictual over the course of the two states' histories. First, they were caught in the overarching environment of the Cold War, with Zaire representing the West-aligned government of Mobutu and Zambia being more aligned with the Soviet Union. The Zambians opposition to and Zaire's ties with the apartheid regime of South Africa shaped part of the conflict. The rivalry was primarily a result of the arbitrary territorial division between the two countries though. The Lunda and Bemba ethnic groups are straddled across both sides of the borders in the Shaba region, which has caused a great deal tension. Zambia became independent on 24 October, 1964. Zambia and Zaire had a border dispute right from the very beginning of their relationship (and before the dispute was between the colonial powers, Belgium and Britain, respectively) over the exact location of the border in the region of Luapula-Pweto Enclave. In February 1965, there was a border incident on Luapula River, the details of which were not fully recorded. Since both Congo and Zambia had now gained independence, this incident was between two new republics dealing with an issue left over from the colonial period. On April 30, 1965, Zambia's Education Minister John Mwanakatwe and Alex Shapi visited Mweru constituency. They were held at gunpoint and manhandled by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarmes after crossing the Lunchinda River at Chipungu. Despite explaining who they were, they were accused of being in Congolese territory. It was not until the following day that a senior Congolese official who spoke Chibemba saved them and apologised for their mistreatment. They crossed the Lunchinda in the knowledge that they were still in Zambian territory, as the maps showed. At this time, there was no clinic at Chipungu, so many Zambians sought medical facilities from the Congolese hospital at Mpweto. Even the Belgium Congolese franc was accepted currency in Chipungu area itself, as it was in Pweto. The fact was, Mwanakatwe was legitimately visiting his constituency, as far as the Zambian map showed. On September 30, 1966, two English geologists, Dr Premoli and Dr Bratley, and 22 Zambians were to undertake geological investigations on the coast of Lake Tanganyika between Moliro and Nsumbu bay. They were arrested by the Congolese (Katangese) gendarme and their maps were confiscated. Congo was at war. The Zambian maps showed that this area was Zambian territory. In November 1966, In Zambia, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Lands wrote to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs giving reference to the Mpweto/Lake Tanganyika boundary. He pointed out that since the border was not clearly established, negotiation was necessary and suggested the setting of a Joint Boundary Commission. The Zambian Surveyor General, D J B Copeland, in a letter dated 18 August 1966, recalled a boundary incident that had occurred in 1961. Surveyors sent by De Beers Prospecting Ltd had an incident near Mpweto with Congolese officials. The surveyors were accused of being in Congo territory and of illegally prospecting for Congolese gold in Moba territory. The Police report showed that they had been arrested at the Chisenga River near Chipunelu. In 1968, the Congolese disputed air space and flying rights over Nippon Mining that had concession rights over Chipushi. On September 30, 1967, the Zambian Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Lishomwa Muuka suggested the need for a boundary commission to discuss the dispute over: the Congolese claim of 8 degrees 18 minutes south; the Zambian claim of 8 degrees 15 minutes south. He saw the need to clarify whether the point was Cape Akalunga or Cape Kipimbi. He wrote to the British High Commissioner for information on the true boundary, but was told there was none available, despite their having been discussions on the delimitation of the boundary in 1927 and 1933. The British, it appeared had washed their hands of the issue and were not bothered at all if the two countries went to war over a border dispute which they had themselves defended for so many years. In 1989, Zambia and Zaire signed the Zambia-Congo Delimitation Treaty. The Zambian enclave of Luapula-Pweto is still currently under Zairian administration as of December 31, 2006. 

On September 29, 1971, Zambia claimed that 3 Zambians had been killed and 10 wounded by Zairian soldiers in action taken against a group of refugees called the Lumpas. This is classified as MID2619. About 2,300 Lumpas were moved back to Zambia and the border was closed for a few days. As tensions between the two countries escalated, the fighting in the southern region of Zaire continued.

FLNC forces invaded the Shaba region in the southern part of Zaire from Zambia in early 1978, classified as MID3602. French and Belgian troops pushed back the invasion.

On October 12, 1979, Angola, Zaire, and Zambia signed a trilateral non-aggression pact. There was a border dispute tough, in the northern Zambian territory of Kaputa in 1980, and Zaire set up border posts 30 miles inside Zambia on August 11, MID3112. Zambian troops clashed with Zairian troops near the border on February 28, 1982, resulting in the deaths of three Zairian soldiers in MID3090. Zaire closed the border with Zambia in the Sakania area (southern Shaba province) on March 2, 1982. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and President Sese Seko Mobutu of Zaire held negotiations in Zaire on August 28-30, 1982. Zambia claimed that two tourists had been abducted on September 5, 1982 in Zaire. 

Zambians and Zairians clashed near the border on September 21, 1983, resulting in the deaths of two Zambians. This is MID3060. Zambian and Zairian representatives held negotiations in Chilabombwe, Zambia on January 16, 1984. On July 17, 1984, Zambia decided to deport 2,500 Zairian and other African nationals. Zaire responded by announcing that the same number of Zambians would be deported from the Shaba region. The order was later recalled, but 2,000 Zambian workers had already fled. President Kaunda and President Mobutu held negotiations in Gbadolite, Zaire on October 4-5, 1986. 

Zairian troops killed a Zambian civilian near the border on February 21, 1990 in MID3955.

During the 1990s, there was a great deal of upheaval in Zaire. There is a MID4307 listed for 1994, which lasted from April 14th to September, 1994. On April 14th, 1994, Zambia has lodged an official complaint over the presence of a Zairean military camp on the Zambian side at Kasumbalesa. Copperbelt Deputy Minister Mr Kangwa Nsuluka lodged the complaint to the Zairean Shaba Province governor, Godwa Mwambula [both elements phonetic], who arrived in the country yesterday to attend the ongoing Zambia-Zaire regional joint permanent commission meeting being held in Ndola. Mr Nsuluka told the Zairean governor [words indistinct] at Kasumbalesa on his arrival from Lubumbashi that it was not proper, according to international law, to place a military camp just about 10 meters away from the Zambian border in the mainland zone. Meanwhile, the Zairean governor told Mr Nsuluka that he would look into the issue following his return to his country later this week. The Mobutu regime was finally overthrown in May of 1997, after maintaining power for thirty years. The rebels, led by future president, Laurent Kabila were backed predominantly by neighboring states.

On May 21, 1990, about 3,500 University of Zambia students brought traffic to a virtual halt for the whole morning in Lusaka when they defied police by taking to the streets to protest against a reported massacre of 150 Zairian students at Lubumbashi University May 18. The city of Lubumbashi, formerly Elizabethville, is located in the southeast corner of Zaire, on Zambia's northern frontier. The protest, which started as a show of solidarity with fellow-students in Zaire, later turned into an anti-Zambian government demonstration as the students marched through the streets of the capital shouting slogans in support of a multi-party political system. The students, who marched for about six miles from their Great East Road campus to the Zairian embassy to Zambia, the foreign affairs ministry and Freedom House, the ruling party headquarters, were briefly intercepted by about 200 riot police in full battle-dress. After a heated argument with threats of violence, the protesters were allowed to continue under the watchful eye of the police, as they chanted slogans against Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko. But Zairian embassy officials refused to meet the students, who displayed placards reading "down with Mobutu the dictator" and "butcher of innocent students" and "Kenneth Kaunda take action" (Kaunda is the president of Zambia). When the march reached the Zambian foreign ministry, Foreign Minister Luke Mwananshiku agreed to meet a delegation from the protesting students. He refused, however, to commit the government in any way because, as he pointed out, there was no official report on the alleged killings. But according to reports from Zairian students fleeing across the border into Zambia, guardsmen surrounded the University of Zaire campus May 18 around four o'clock in the morning local time, then charged the students with bayonets drawn. A second-year student in the school of medicine who escaped told Zambian pressmen in Ndola at the Kasumbalesa border post, that "as the campus was filled with the screams of the dying and wounded, lecturers fled from the university." The student, who asked not to give his name for security reasons, said: "The situation was gruesome as bodies could be seen lying all over the campus while hundreds of wounded were rushed to the Gecamines and Tshisenda hospitals. The dead were quickly buried."

On October 4, 1991, the Zambian government was making arrangements to evacuate more than 40,000 Zambian nationals in Zaire following disturbances in that country, a government official said. Priority in the evacuation endeavor will be given to wives and children, said Edward Chizu, permanent secretary for foreign affairs. He confirmed that Zambian ambassador to Zaire, Aaron Mulenga had sent SOS to the government to move the nationals, based on recent developments in Zaire that had led to the formation of a crisis government. Over 110 people have been reported killed since unrest broke out in Zaire last week. The violence and looting which was initiated by a group of soldiers in the capital city of kinshasa have since forced thousands of foreigners to flee the country.

''During the night of 11th to 12th October 1991, two uncontrolled elements of the Civil Guard, based on the two countries' common border, attacked the crew of a Zambian train travelling from Sakania [in Zaire] to Ndola [in Zambia] '', Voix du Zaire (Lubumbashi) reported on 18th October. The robbery, according to the radio, had ''caused a diplomatic incident which might have negative effects on the border traffic between Zaire and the Copperbelt'' and this explained the reason why ''a high-ranking official delegation is leaving Lubumbashi on 18th October, 1981, for Ndola, in Zambia, to restore the mood of calm and patience which has always prevailed in the relations of brotherhood and good neighborliness despite a few chance mishaps.''

On 10th January, 1992, thousands of Zambians living in neighboring Zaire have been told to return home and look for jobs in their own country following measures by Zaire to repatriate her nationals to their respective native provinces. Zambia's consul-general in Lubumbashi, Reverend Richard Nyendwa, told the 'Zambia Daily Mail' in [an] interview from Lubumbashi that [the] Zairean authorities had taken a hard-line stance on their nationals, who have been directed to go back to their home villages and develop them in line with a resolution passed at the ongoing national conference of all the political parties in Kinshasa, the Zairean capital. Rev Nyendwa said the Kasai of Shaba Province have been told to return to Kasai Province where they come from. It is understood that Shaba, the main producer of the country's copper and on the border with Zambia in the north, is invaded by foreign factions and measures are being taken to redress the situation. ''It is for this reason that we have also told our fellow Zambians to return home'', he said. A majority of the Zambians living in Zaire are self-employed traders or tinsmiths.

Tanzania plans to host a sub-regional summit on the political crisis in Zaire. Initiated by Zambia, the summit will discuss the current political situation in Zaire where the country's strongman-President Mobutu Sese Seko-is resisting the democratization demands of the opposition. "Mobutu has agreed on the planned summit and we are working on it", a senior government official told IPS on August 12, 1993. "The situation in Zaire is volatile and needs our attention," the official said after a visit last week by an envoy of Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. Presidents Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Chiluba of Zambia and Sam Nujoma of Namibia are expected to attend the meeting whose date is yet to be fixed. "Mobutu wants the summit to be held as soon as possible because he is desperate and the situation is worsening," the source told IPS. Zaire has two rival prime ministers, two parliaments, and a prostrate economy as a direct result of Mobutu's determination over the last three years to hold off democratization demands from the opposition, backed by Western donors. He has used patronage in an attempt to buy off critics, and his control of the security forces to ruthlessly maintain his 28-year grip on power. Recently, there have been clashes between Zaire and its neighbors, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda, which has created sub-regional concern that Zaire's problems may spill across its borders. Mobutu is also accused of giving military assistance to Angola's rebel Union for Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA). "Mobutu wants us (Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda and Namibia) to help him solve Zaire's internal problems. He doesn't want Western countries," the official said. Earlier this year, transitional prime minister and Mobutu's arch foe, Etienne Tshisekedi, appealed for external intervention. Mobutu has accepted Organization of African Unity (OAU) mediation and the United Nations is planning to send an observer mission. Tanzania, buoyed by its success in facilitating the Rwandese peace agreement earlier this month, is keen to offer its services over the Zairean crisis. "We hope Tanzania will also help to solve similar problems in Zaire," the government source said. "Without our intervention, the situation in Zaire will get worse."

On February 22, 1995, Zaire handed back to Zambia two soldiers who were detained in Lubumbashi, the Shaba province capital, after they had strayed into Zairean territory a fortnight ago. The soldiers were handed over to Zambian authorities at Kasumbalesa border post by a Zairean government official, Moses Kabaku. He said the soldiers had been well-treated during their detention in line with what he called the good relations existing between the two countries. Zambia and Zaire have committed themselves are to take urgent measures aimed at combating crime that is prevalent at their common border. In a joint-communique signed in Lusaka on July 22, 1996, at the end of a two-day meetings between the deputy minister of foreign affairs, Dr Peter Machungwa and his Zairean counterpart Lokondo Yoka, the two countries will from now onwards deal seriously with cross-border motor vehicle thefts and armed banditry by providing necessary information about known criminals to police of each other who may be harbouring in either country. The two governments will also ensure that timely information especially on transit times of cargo to various destinations and security is provided to curb thefts of minerals like cobalt and copper. Copper thieves and those of cobalt will be treated like common motor vehicle bandits and these will be prosecuted within the applicable laws of the both countries. Stolen goods will, when recovered, be handed back to the rightful owners once recovered. Zambia and Zaire have for a long time been experiencing thefts of minerals and motor vehicles from either sides especially in border towns. Prior to the signing of the joint communique Dr Machungwa described the two-day meetings with Mr Yoka as successful. He said the outcome of the meeting will help curb the crime in the both countries. And Mr Yoka expressed happiness in that they managed to put in place legal and diplomatic instruments that will end smuggling in both countries. He said the Zairean community will be informed that Zambian authorities will no longer accept goods impounded or stolen from Zaire. Meanwhile Dr Machungwa has said Zambia and Zaire share common ties which must be strengthened in order that misunderstandings are avoided. He said the two countries were both members of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations and COMESA which must strengthen their resolve to work closely together. Zambia and Zaire shared common poverty levels, long geographical ties and economic problems that threaten to derail meaningful cooperation. Dr Machungwa was speaking at a dinner he hosted for his Zairean counterpart Mr Lokondo Yoka at Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka. He called on the two countries to work towards lessening cross border crimes which included thefts of copper from Zambia and cobalt from Zaire in order to improve the welfare of the two peoples. He said enhanced economic cooperation would lead to success of both countries' development programs. On the political front Dr Machungwa noted that Zaire had contributed to peace in the region and cited the 1993 when President Mobutu Sese Seko brokered the Angola peace talks. He said Zaire had made sacrifices on the Rwanda and Burundi conflicts by accepting more than 2 million refugees who migrated from horrors brought about by warring factions there. And Zairean deputy foreign affairs minister, Yoka said trade relations, economic ties and security must be strengthened as these were the cornerstones of democracy.

While the South African issue for which the two states were on opposing sides ended in 1990, and the Cold War as well around the same time, other central issues have not been settled. Particularly, the ethnic and border dispute revolving around the Shaba region is still without a solution in sight as of 2006, even though it became a latent conflict since the signing of the Delimitation Treaty of 1989. During the mid and late-1990s, Zambia played the role of mediator to the internationalized civil war in DR Congo.

The years of 1996-1998 represented a turning point in the Zambian-Zairian relations. Zambia emerged as the mediator of Central African states, because of its role to bring about a peaceful resolution of the DR Congo's civil wars. Secondly, the end of the Mobutu Sese Seko regime allowed for closer cooperation between Zambia and Zaire on issues regarding border criminality, defense and security. During the last years of the Mobutu's regime Zambians living in Zaire had to suffer at the hands of Zairians who blamed them for the problems of unemployment and other social ills that existed in Zaire. Hundrends of thousands of Zambians had to flee back to their country in order not to be murdered. 

On November 3, 1996, Zambia's UNIP president, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, has expressed concern at the on going fighting in neighboring Zaire saying he was willing to mediate. Speaking at a press briefing at Inter-Continental Hotel in Lusaka Dr Kaunda said he was prepared to mediate in the civil strife that has led to wide-spread fighting between the Tutsi-ethnic minority Zaireans, Banyamulenge, and Zairean soldiers on the borders of Zaire and Rwanda. He claimed that already there have been requests from Burundi appealing to him to intervene in the matter that has resulted in many Zairean border towns falling into the hands of the rebel army. He said he was ready to work alongside his old friend, Dr Julius Nyerere of Tanzania in dealing with this matter.

Ten more armed Zairean soldiers, posing as immigration and customs officials, have been arrested by Zambia's security forces after crossing the Luapula river into Zambia, the minister for Luapula Province, Norman Chibamba said on April 1, 1997. Chimbaba also announced that two armed Burundian soldiers were arrested. Eight other Burundian soldiers were being held by police at Mwense, after crossing the Luapula river when Zaire's rebel forces captured Kasenga town. Chibamba said scores of heavily armed Zairean soldiers have been spotted at the Makandwe fishing camp on the banks of the Luapula river near the town, Mwense. "Armed Zairean soldiers on Zambian soil should surrender themselves to local authorities or be ruthlessly dealt with," Zambia's minister of Defence, Ben Mwila said but declined to divulge what type of action to be meted out to recalcitrant Zairean soldiers. Meanwhile, nearly all of the more than 1,000 Zairean refugees that had crossed into Zambia at the weekend, had began moving back to Zaire. The move to return back to Zaire was prompted by the news reaching them from Kasenga that all was calm in the small dusty town.

The Zambian government has recalled all its diplomats and their families from Kinshasa as Laurent Kabila's rebel forces close in on the Zairean capital, Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Shimba said on April 25, 1997, in Lusaka. Only the ambassador and the consul-general in Lubumbashi would remain in Zaire to monitor the situation but they might be recalled too depending on the security situation in Zaire, the minister said. About 48 families of the Kinshasa-and Lubumbashi-based diplomats were evacuated to Zambia's Copperbelt region in early March when Kabila's forces advanced on Lubumbashi. Kabila had since re-established an administration at all customs and immigration border posts with Zambia at Kasumbalesa, Kipushi, Mokambo and Sakanya, Shimba said. Zambian and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) government officials are to hold talks in Kinshasa soon to map out strategies for the repatriation of Congolese refugees still stranded in Zambia, a government spokesman said on January 5, 1998. Zambian Home Affairs (Interior) Minister Peter Machungwa and Defence Minister Chitalu Sampa are to attend the Kinshasa meeting. Machungwa said there were still about 2,000 Congose refugees in Zambia, including 500 elite troops of the late Zambian president Mobutu Sese Seko. The troops, he said, are homesick and have often staged abortive escapes from the Natende and Nkolemfumu refugee camps in Kasama in northern Zambia. A spokesman for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Zambia, Royn Mponda, said the repatriation of the 500 soldiers would commence as soon as Kinshasa gave the go-ahead. More than 8,000 Congolese refugees crossed into Zambia at the peak of the civil war in the former Zaire.

On January 12, 1998, Zambia and Congo-Kinshasa have concluded the Permanent Commission on Defense agreement which has dragged for years. Zambia's Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said on arrival from Congo-Kinshasa that insecurity at borders of the two countries had been a growing concern to the two peoples. The protocol is expected to address security problems that the two countries were facing, especially on the Kasumbalesa border post and the pedicle road where Zambians had been killed and lost property. Mr Sampa signed the agreement for Zambia. "I met the Congolese President Laurent Kabila who expressed gratitude at the way Zambia had handled the volatile situation on the two countries' borders. "We also thank our Congolese counterparts for agreeing to end the long-standing problem of insecurity on our borders. We hope our people will move freely into and from either country," Mr Sampa said. He said the agreements had in the past been derailed by lack of seriousness shown by the then government of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. "The negotiations have dragged because of the past dictatorship of the late Mobutu which did not show interest in solving this problem. The lack of a reasonable government made matters difficult. There was only a fragile agreement between the then Zairean Shaba province and our Copperbelt Province, but now this is at national level. Our people had started enjoying the peace after the fall of the dictatorial regime," he said.

Many Congolese citizens regard the summit on the crisis in the Great Lakes scheduled to open in Lusaka, Zambia, 27 December 1998 as the last chance to find a solution to the conflicts in the area. Almost everyone in the Democratic Republic of Congo seems to agree that a solution can only come through internal dialogue among the sons and daughters of the country. President Laurent Kabila says such a dialogue would be concretized with the organization of general elections in 1999 to enable the Congolese people to choose their leaders. Zambia has been acting as a mediator in the bloody DRC wars of the late 1990s. 

Repatriation of soldiers from the Democratic Republic of, who fled into Zambia in late March 1999 following intense fighting with rebels, has begun, an official has said. The official, who declined to be named, said the soldiers under heavy guard travelled from Kaputa in the Northern Province Wednesday via Ndola to Kasumbalesa where they would enter their own country. The soldiers were supposed to travel through the night but had a breakdown along the Ndola-Kapiri Mposhi highway and had to temporarily camp at Musa Kasonka Stadium in Masala township. The official did not give the number of the soldiers. A correspondent of the Zambian news agency found the Congolese soldiers, most of them clad in military fatigue, waiting at the Musa Kasonka stadium to board buses for Kasumbalesa.

On August 18, 2003, the Zambian minister of defense says the government has managed to contain the security situation in border areas where incursions of pro-Kinshasa ethnic militias Mai-Mai rebels from the Democratic Republic of Congo were reported recently. Michael Mulenga says the security situation has stabilized in Kaputa District in Luapula Province northern Zambia, where the rebels were reportedly harassing villagers. Mr Mulenga was speaking to Zambia News Agency, Zana. The minister also disclosed that efforts are being made to address the problem of illegal movement of livestock from Zambia to neighboring countries. Mr Mulenga said government is aware that some people in border areas are exchanging their livestock for firearms. He said the illegal transactions between the locals and some foreigners could put the security of the nation at risk.

On September 29, 2004, the careless remarks by Zambia's vice-president, Nevers Mumba, on the politics of his country have elicited a sharp reaction from opposition figures and now the government of President Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of Congo wants some action. Mumba stunned Zambians nearly a fortnight ago when he claimed in the northern city of Ndola that some opposition leaders have teamed up and were getting money from DR Congo with which to destabilise the government of president Levy Mwanawasa. Mumba had told cadres of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in Ndola that money plundered from Zambia was pouring in from across the Congo border to fund opposition parties in destabilising the Zambian government. Now the Congo DR government has reacted by asking the Zambian government to send a five-person team to Kinshasa to fully investigate claims that opposition parties in Zambia were getting money from DR Congo for subversive activities. Kabila reportedly passed on the demand for investigations to Mwanawasa when the two met in New York at the United Nations General Assembly. Apart from calling for a full investigation into the allegations, Kinshasa has also denied claims by Zambia that it has been harbouring fugitives of the law such as former director general of the Zambia Intelligence and Security Services, Xavier Chungu and former Zambian ambassador to Washington, Attan Shansonga. Both men abandoned court cases and fled the country six months ago and are now at large abroad. But the Congolese ambassador to Zambia, Jean-Marie Dikanga Kazadi, denied that Chungu had ever fled to his country after leaving Zambia. He pointed out that Zambian leaders made similar claims last year when former finance minister, Katele Kalumba, went into hiding. And Kalumba was later discovered to be alive and well in his home region of Luapula. Kazadi said the Zambian investigators will be 'free to go wherever they want', adding: "In case of proper evidence being found the Democratic Republic of Congo will take measures that will punish the culprits". "The Democratic Republic of Congo feels it is being wrongly accused," Kazadi said. Dean Mung'omba, leader of the Zambia Alliance for Progress, promptly described the remarks as treasonable, and accused Mumba as setting a stage for arrests of opposition figures under the guise that they were involved in subversive activities against the nation. "The failure at constitutionalism, economic and social management, failure at orderly prosecution of corruption and the general decadence of our leadership can not be attributed to the Democratic Republic of Congo," Mung'omba said. Edith Nawakwi, vice-president of the Forum for Democracy and Development and Guy Scott, secretary-general of the Patriotic Front, have challenged Mumba to produce concrete evidence on the claimed subversive activities by opposition parties.

On November 22, 2004, the government of Congo DR has requested the Zambian government to assist in the in the recovery of US $19,000 owed to Congo Airlines by the defunct Zambian Express. The Congolese government made the request while discussing air transport during a joint permanent commission between two governments early this month. And the commission was informed that Zambian Airways was considering the possibility of extending its services to Kinshasa. The JPC noted that Zambian Airways currently services the Lusaka-Ndola-Lubumbashi route. Meanwhile, the Zambia Revenue Authority has concluded and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Railway Systems of Zambia to facilitate movements of goods in transit through Zambia. During the JPC, the DRC side informed the commission that RSZ did not allow the loading of cement and sugar imports from Zambia at Ndola as it contended that it was not economical to transport such cargo to DRC. The DRC side noted that RSZ insists on loading such cargo at Kapiri Mposhi instead. The commission noted that this was a private transaction based on business consideration. The Zambian side, however, undertook to raise the matter with RSZ and revert to the DRC side as soon as possible. And the DRC side informed the commission that the Mpulungu Harbour Corporation is demanding payment for the Zongwe ship and two boats, which are anchored at the port.

The non-arrival of a Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) delegation has delayed the holding of the 10th Joint Permanent Commission (JPC) of co-operation with Zambia. The delegation which was expected in the country for the JPC that was supposed to take place on November 2, 2004 at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre had not arrived by November 1, 2004. DRC Ambassador to Zambia Jean-Marie Kazadi and Ministry of Foreign Affairs information officer Mushaukwa Lubinda both confirmed that the delegation led by DRC Minister of Regional Co-operation Mbusa Nyamwisa was being expected in the country. Ambassador Kazadi yesterday said he was contacting Kinshasa to find out on which day the delegation would arrive in Zambia for the JPC. He, however, said the JPC is likely to be held this week depending on the arrival of the delegation. Lubinda said Zambian foreign affairs minister Kalombo Mwansa and his delegation were ready for the Congo-Zambia JPC and were just waiting for their counterparts. He said the only information that the ministry had was that the Congolese delegation was facing problems to come to Zambia and that it was liasing with the embassy to get the actual day when they would arrive. "We are likely to reschedule the meeting for a day or two depending on which day our colleagues will arrive in the country," he said. The date for the Zambia-Congo JPC had come after weeks of discussions between the two governments because the DRC government had earlier complained over souring relations. Ambassador Kazadi had in September attributed the delay in holding the JPC to the same suspicious relationship between Zambia and DRC. Recently dismissed Republican vice-president Nevers Mumba had told a group of MMD cadres in Ndola that government was aware that the DRC borders were being used by some plunderers in the former administration to destabilise the country. However, President Mwanawasa held a meeting with his Congo DR counterpart and apologized for the statement.
