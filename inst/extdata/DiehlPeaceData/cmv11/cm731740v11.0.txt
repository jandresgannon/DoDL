This dispute involves a series of 26 incidents between November 1993 and April 1995. The primary participants in the dispute were South Korea, North Korea, and USA. Japan was the subject of a North Korean threat in March 1994 and participated in a joint naval exercise with USA, South Korea, Australia, and Canada forces in June 1994. Australian and Canadian participation in the dispute was limited to the naval exercises. During the dispute, North Korea and the AmericanSouth Korean side exchanged alerts, threats of forces and war, and shows of force. Both sides conducted border fortifications and North Korea violated the South Korean border as it challenged the Korean War armistice agreement. First day of dispute was on 3/26/1994 and last day of dispute was on 6/17/1994.

This dispute consisted of 49 incidents that occurred between 10/10/94 and 9/99. Although this is a large number of incidents over a long period of time, the longest duration between incidents was approximately 5.5 months. In addition, the pattern in which the incidents occurred suggests that they are linked and should be considered as one dispute. In the dispute, North Korea continually challenges South Korean territorial boundaries along the DMZ and in the waters along the Northern Limit Line. South Korea responds by placing its forces on alert, conducting military exercises, showing ships and planes, and clashing with North Korean vessels that cross into South Korean waters and North Korea troops that cross the DMZ. Despite the distinction between the land and naval incursions by North Korea, their timing close together suggests a broader effort to challenge South Korean borders. On 4/10/97 (incident FE00190) North Korean troops crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory. Less than 2 months later (FE00194), North Korean vessels crossed into South Korean waters and a clash between North and South Korean vessels ensued. Slightly more than one later (FE00192), on 7/10/97 North Korean troops again crossed the DMZ and another clash ensued. Furthermore, throughout this period North Korean submersibles violated both South Korean waters and land. The South Korean reaction to these incidents also suggests that they were viewed as broader challenges to South Korean territory rather than separate challenges along the DMZ. For example, as a result of the 7/16/97 clash in the DMZ, South Korea placed its forces along both the DMMMZ and Northern Limit Line on alert in incident FE00217. During the dispute the incidents of highest severity included: 12/17/94 - North Korean forces shot down an American helicopter that had strayed across the DMZ (FE00038), 5/30/95-North Korea fired at and seized a South Korean fishing vessel that had strayed into North Korean waters, 6/5/97 - A clash between North and South Korean vessels when a North Korean vessel crossed into Southern waters (FE00194), 7/16/97-A clash between North and South Korean troops when 14 North Korean troops crossed the DMZ (FE00192), 9/9/97-South Korean forces intercepted and killed a North Korean soldier that had crossed teh DMZ (FE00199), 12/18/98-A clash occurred when South Korean forces chased and fired upon a North Korean semi-submersible that had crossed into South Korean territory (FE00238), 6/15/99-A naval clash ensued when South Korean vessels rammed North Korean vessels that were violating South Korean waters (FE00268 & FE00267). Interspersed between these major actions were threats, border fortifications, alerts, and shows of force. First day of dispute was on 8/31/1998 and last day of dispute was on 12/00/1998.

This dispute consists of 1 incident in which Japanese patrol boats exchanged fire with a North Korean spy ship. The dispute began when a Japanese patrol plane spotted the ship 90 miles NW of Amami-O-Shima Island. Japanese patrol boats approached the vessel, ordering it to stop and firing warning shots at the vessel. Japanese forces tried to board the vessel but were fended off with pipes. Japanese forces then pursued the North Korean vessel westward, surrounding the vessel 240 miles off Amami-O-shima. According to reports, the North Korean vessel fired rockets at the Japanese patrol boats, missing them. The Japanese and North Korean forces also exchanged automatic weapon fire. The North Korean vessel sank following the exchange, most likely due to an explosion the North Koreans attempted to set. In total, 3 Japanese crew members were injured, 3 North Koreans were killed, and 12 North Koreans were missing. North Korea is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are challenging Japanese territorial integrity. The Japanese actions are only in response to those of North Korea and are only designed to return to the status quo. First and last day of dispute was on 12/22/2001.

In the dispute, North Korea continually challenges South Korean territorial boundaries along the DMZ and in the waters along the Northern Limit Line. South Korea responds by placing its forces on alert, conducting military exercises, showing ships and planes, and clashing with North Korean vessels that cross into South Korean waters and North Korea troops that cross the DMZ. Despite the distinction between the land and naval incursions by North Korea, their timing close together suggests a broader effort to challenge South Korean borders. On 4/10/97 (incident FE00190) North Korean troops crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory. Less than 2 months later (FE00194), North Korean vessels crossed into South Korean waters and a clash between North and South Korean vessels ensued. Slightly more than one later (FE00192), on 7/10/97 North Korean troops again crossed the DMZ and another clash ensued. Furthermore, throughout this period North Korean submersibles violated both South Korean waters and land. The South Korean reaction to these incidents also suggests that they were viewed as broader challenges to South Korean territory rather than separate challenges along the DMZ. For example, as a result of the 7/16/97 clash in the DMZ, South Korea placed its forces along both the DMMMZ and Northern Limit Line on alert in incident FE00217. During the dispute the incidents of highest severity included: 12/17/94-North Korean forces shot down an American helicopter that had strayed across the DMZ (FE00038), 5/30/95-North Korea fired at and seized a South Korean fishing vessel that had strayed into North Korean waters, 6/5/97-A clash between North and South Korean vessels when a North Korean vessel crossed into Southern waters (FE00194), 7/16/97-A clash between North and South Korean troops when 14 North Korean troops crossed the DMZ (FE00192), 9/9/97-South Korean forces intercepted and killed a North Korean soldier that had crossed teh DMZ (FE00199), 12/18/98-A clash occurred when South Korean forces chased and fired upon a North Korean semi-submersible that had crossed into South Korean territory (FE00238), 6/15/99-A naval clash ensued when South Korean vessels rammed North Korean vessels that were violating South Korean waters (FE00268 & FE00267). Interspersed between these major actions were threats, border fortifications, alerts, and shows of force.

MID4226 This dispute consists of one incident in which North Korea deployed ballistic missiles on mobile launchers that were capable of hitting Tokyo. Reports indicated that the missile deployment was a North Korean attempt to improve their bargaining position in normalization talks with Japan.

MID4225 This dispute consists of three incidents in which North Korean spy vessels entered Japanese waters. In response, Japanese vessels chased the vessels for 24 hours. During the chase Japanese planes dropped bombs and Japanese naval vessels fired warning shots. In addition, Japan scrambled 2 F-15s to the area. In response, North Korea scrambled 4 fighters to the area.

MID4266 This dispute consists of 1 incident in which Japanese patrol boats exchanged fire with a North Korean spy ship. The dispute began when a Japanese patrol plane spotted the ship 90 miles NW of Amami-O-Shima Island. Japanese patrol boats approached the vessel, ordering it to stop and firing warning shots at the vessel. Japanese forces tried to board the vessel but were fended off with pipes. Japanese forces then pursued the North Korean vessel westward, surrounding the vessel 240 miles off Amami-O-shima. According to reports, the North Korean vessel fired rockets at the Japanese patrol boats, missing them. The Japanese and North Korean forces also exchanged automatic weapon fire. The North Korean vessel sank following the exchange, most likely due to an explosion the North Koreans attempted to set. In total, 3 Japanese crew members were injured, 3 North Koreans were killed, and 12 North Koreans were missing. North Korea is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are challenging Japanese territorial integrity. The Japanese actions are only in response to those of North Korea and are only designed to return to the status quo.

On December 22, 2001, an unidentified ship, believed to be North Korean, sinks in the East China Sea after a shootout with Japanese patrol boats. On March 11, 2002, the NPA adds a Japanese woman to its list of abductees, bringing the total to 11 people in eight cases.

On September 17, 2002, the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Pyongyang for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The North admits 13 Japanese on the NPA abductee list were abducted or went voluntarily to North Korea, five of them are alive and eight died. Koizumi and Kim sign the Pyongyang Declaration calling for efforts to normalize diplomatic ties. On October 8, 2002, the NPA adds four people to its official list of abduction victims, bringing the total to 15. Three of the four are among the 13 the North admitted to abducting. On October 15, 2002, five abductees return to Japan. On October 29-30, 2002, Japan and North Korea hold the 12th round of talks on normalizing diplomatic ties in Kuala Lumpur. On August 27-29, 2003, the first round of six-nation talks on North Korea's nuclear program takes place in Beijing. On February 11-13, 2004, the senior Japanese Foreign Ministry officials visit Pyongyang for talks on the abduction issue. On February 25-28, 2004, the second round of the six-nation nuclear talks takes place in Beijing. On May 22, 2004, Koizumi makes his second trip to Pyongyang, meets Kim and returns to Japan with family members of four of the repatriated abductees. Kim promises to reinvestigate the fates of 10 missing Japanese on Tokyo's list of abduction victims. On June 14, 2004, Japan enacts a law that allows the government to ban foreign ships considered a threat to public security, apparently targeting the North Korean ferry Mangyongbong-92, the only vessel sailing between Japan and North Korea. On June 23-26, 2004, the third round of the six-nation nuclear talks takes place in Beijing. On July 9, 2004, the fifth repatriated Japanese abductee is reunited in Jakarta with her family from North Korea-her American husband, who was a U.S. soldier who had defected to North Korea, and their two daughters. On July 18, 2004, the returnee's family arrives in Japan from Indonesia. On August 5, 2004, Japan decided to send North Korea 125,000 tons of food and $7 million worth of medical aid as part of humanitarian aid Koizumi promised Kim at their May 2004 summit. On August 11-12, 2004, Japan and North Korea hold their first working-level meeting on abduction issues in Beijing. On September 25-26, 2004, Japan and North Korea hold their second working-level abduction talks in Beijing. Pyongyang gives a verbal report on its new findings in the reinvestigation, but Tokyo says they are insufficient. On November 9-14, 2004, Japan and North Korea hold their third working-level abduction talks in Pyongyang. Between July 26 and August 7, 2005, the first half of the fourth round of the six-nation talks takes place in Beijing.

Japan proposes to formally resume negotiations on normalizing ties while handling two other issues-North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals and the country's nuclear and missile programs-in parallel through separate working groups. On November 9-11, 2005, the fifth round of the six-nations talks were held in Beijing and goes into recess. A chairman's statement issued by China says the parties confirm their commitment to implementing the joint statement adopted in September and agree to draw up a concrete plan to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. On December 24-25, 2005, Japan and North Korea hold bilateral talks in Beijing and agree to set up three working groups for parallel discussions on diplomatic normalization, the abductions and North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. On February 4, 2006, Japan and North Korea start the three-track parallel talks in Beijing.

On July 7, 2006, North Korea demanded that Japan withdraw sanctions it has imposed on the country in reaction to Pyongyang's test-firing of ballistic missiles, warning that the North would take "stronger measures" should Tokyo continue along its current path. Song Il Ho, North Korea's ambassador in charge of diplomatic normalization talks with Japan, also told reporters the North does not see the missile launches as violating a 2002 bilateral declaration with Japan, adding it believes it is still possible for the two countries to hold talks on their ties. "Japan has announced sanctions, but I think it is in the interest of Japan to halt them," Song said. The sanctions "would force us to take stronger physical actions" as a response, he added. Asked what those steps may be, Song said, "I leave that to your imagination." Japan announced a series of measures against the missile launches, including a half-year ban on port calls by the only passenger link between Japan and North Korea, as well as a halt to trips to North Korea by Japanese government officials. Japan's sanctions against North Korea are "unspeakable" as the country has yet to atone for its 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean Peninsula and Pyongyang should be the one imposing punitive measures on Tokyo, Song reasoned. Japan's sanctions "could bring about devastating consequences, the entire responsibility for which would rest with Japan," he said. Song accused Japan of turning the international community against the country over its missile launching. "Japan is becoming the main driver of the missile fuss" by soliciting support for opposition against North Korea, he said. "There have been rather severe reactions from countries such as Australia and South Korea as well, but their responses have not been as persistent as Japan's," he said. Song said North Korea does not see the missile launches as violating the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, which mentions a missile launch moratorium. "The moratorium was effective under the condition that Japan would atone for its past, and would normalize relation with us," Song said. "But Japan has taken actions that go against that" and so North Korea is no longer bound by that moratorium, he said. Japan had urged North Korea to refrain from the missile launches, citing the moratorium agreed to between Pyongyang and Washington in 1999 and reconfirmed in the Japan-North Korea declaration. Song said that North Korea is willing to hold negotiations with Japan on normalizing their relations, but indicated it wants Tokyo to lift sanctions it imposed. "The sanctions include a ban on Japanese government officials' visit to our country," he said. "That means the two countries cannot hold contact. On the question of what the conditions are for resuming the negotiations, I think Japan can decide for itself," he said. Japan and North Korea last held talks on normalizing diplomatic relations in Beijing in February 2006. They were unable to make headway, with Japan calling for a solution to their dispute over Japanese nationals abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s, and North Korea demanding Japan's atonement for its colonization of the Korean Peninsula.

As of December 2006 several important issues in the North Korean-Japanese relations were not solved. The diplomatic relations were not normalized, the issue of the abductees was not addressed and the nuclear weapons of North Korea remained an important security threat to Japan. Thus, the rivalry is not finished as of December 2006.
