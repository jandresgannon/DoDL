TERRLINK: MID3957 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID3957 3 -- uncertain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3957 from Gibler 2018, this is the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Oman, as part of a coalition, expelled Iraq from Kuwait. (Saudi was also allowing the US to use bases in its territory to launch air raids.) Coded third party link to territorial dispute because the Gulf War was a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, and Oman became involved to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not list Jordan as a participant in this dispute, and Jordan did not participate in the military action or support either side.
