TERRLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Serbia was not claiming the Yugoslavian states' territory as under its own sovereignty, but did dispute their international boundaries in the sense that Serbia thought the Yugoslavian states should not have their own boundaries independent of a Yugoslavian state. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Greece (as part of UN/NATO) became involved in this MID, which is territorial, civil war, and civil war link. See CIVWARMID and CIVWARLINK.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/indepence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia, armed the villagers, and the newly armed villagers violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia. 

CIVWARLINK: MID3551 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3551 coded civil war link because this also involved militarized rebel groups, organized along ethnic lines, fighting against each other and against the Yugoslavian/secessionist states' armies. Here, there were rebel groups fighting in Croatia and Slovenia, outside this dyad.

TERRLINK-CER: MID4137 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of protecting the ethnic Serbs there.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 6/11/1998 and last day of dispute was on 6/10/1999.

Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. 

MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

On January 31st, 1946, the new constitution of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was adopted, modeling the Soviet Union's. Yugoslavia was officially a Communist country. On February 3rd, 1946, Tito, the leader of the Yugoslav Republic told the Yugoslav Parliament that the relations with Greece had improved.

On February 28th, 1953, Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia signed a five years treaty of `friendship and cooperation', in which they pledged to defend each other. This was extended to a 20 years pact on August 9, 1954.

On July 28th, 1956, President Tito of Yugoslavia ended his official visit to Greece. He met with the Greek royal family and the Greek Prime Minister, Karamanlis. Constantine Karamanlis, the Greek Prime Minister met with Yugoslav President Tito, during a visit to Belgrade in December 1956. 

Yugoslavia and Greece agreed on November 6, 1964, to reopen border traffic and to permit toll-free transport between the two countries. There are some outstanding issues remaining between the two countries. Yugoslavia requests that its free-zone extends to the commercial harbor of Thessaloniki and the setting up of customs free-zones at the border with Greece. Also a Greek claim for 2 million dollars in compensations for property nationalized by the Yugoslav authorities made no headways. 
Following a visit by Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou, to Belgrade, on February 4th, 1965, Yugoslavia expressed its foreign policy to support Greece on the Cyprus-related conflict. 

The Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, has been the driving force behind the new round of Balkan diplomacy in 1975. On August 5, 1975, Greece and Yugoslavia signed an agreement for the construction of crude oil pipeline from Korinos, Greece, to Skopje, Yugoslavia, where an oil refinery will be built. His latest initiative, for a conference of Balkan economic ministers looks, unexpectedly, like succeeding. Yugoslavia accepted his invitation in September 1975 in a personal message from President Tito. Yugoslavia, which has started several joint projects with Greece in Macedonia, is keen to expand its investment in Salonika, a traditional outlet for Yugoslav trade with the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. A Greek-Yugoslav oil pipeline linking Salonika and northern Yugoslavia is under discussion.

One could say that the relations between Greece and Yugoslavia are traditionally good and friendly and that the differences in the social systems, as well as the different international positions, have never represented a hindrance to the open dialogue on all issues of mutual interest. The damage inflicted on the Yugoslav-Greek co-operation by the fascist military junta were quickly overcome because the junta's seven-year rule could not undermine the Greek people's trust towards Yugoslavia, just as extreme Right-wing forces which today too are haranguing against good-neighborly relations between Yugoslavia and Greece too are not succeeding. There is no discrepancy of any kind, either in words or deeds, between the non-aligned position of Yugoslavia and the policy which Yugoslavia is pursuing towards all neighboring countries. By its entire policy, Yugoslavia has always attached foremost significance to such co-operation and will continue to do so regardless of some types of behavior on the other side. After all, it is known that Greece, like the majority of neighboring countries, appreciates this policy of Yugoslavia's.

In the talks which President Tito and Veselin Djuranovic, President of the Federal Executive Council, will have with Greek Premier Karamanlis on March 17, 1979, many important issues of mutual interest will be dealt with, from bilateral co-operation to talks on topical international problems. Although a member of NATO, Greece is conscious of the significance and role of the non-aligned countries in the struggle for lasting and stable peace in the world, in particular of the role played by President Tito and Yugoslavia. This is also the reason for the interest which Greece is displaying in developing and promoting co-operation with Yugoslavia in every sphere.

In the course of the Yugoslav-Greek talks particular attention will be paid to the situation in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean, as well as to the preparations for the next session of the conference on European security. Yugoslavia and Greece are very interested in the stability of circumstances in this part of the world and are ready, each in its own way, to act in this direction. The national interests of both countries demand continuous deepening and promotion of co-operation and thus also the solving, by mutual agreement, of everything which hinders such co-operation. It is in this spirit-we are convinced-that the talks between Tito and Karamanlis, this being their third meeting, will also take place.

Greece and Yugoslavia signed a protocol on cooperation in commerce, industry, transport, agriculture, tourism and science and technology at the end of the 9th session of the mixed Greek-Yugoslav ministerial committee held here from October 17 to 25, 1979. Yugoslavia agreed to increase its imports from Greece so as to balance the two countries' trade. the two sides held that there were considerable possibilities for cooperation in the manufacture of electric appliances, cars and buses, and that they should try to set up joint ventures to this end. Under the protocol, Greece and Yugoslavia agreed to increase, in the next five years, the volume of Greek goods transported through Yugoslavia by rail and of Yugoslav goods in transit through the Greek port of Thessaliniki. Regarding the construction of an oil pipe-line between the two countries, Yugoslavia has accepted a Greek proposal to set up an oil terminal at the gulf of Therma.

Greek-Yugoslav talks began in Belgrade on May 26, 1982, which, as was stressed both by [the Greek] Prime Minister, Papandreou, and the Yugoslav side, will contribute to greater co-operation between the two countries, something that will be useful not only for Greece and Yugoslavia but more generally for peace in the Balkans. Papandreou arrived in Belgrade on a three-day official visit, the first he is paying to a Balkan country in his capacity as Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Foreign Minister, Kharalambopoulos, the Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister, Maroudhas, the director of his Diplomatic Office, Makhairitsas, and Ministry officials

Greece and Yugoslavia are to promote their economic relations, stated Kostas Vaitsos, [Greek Deputy Minister] of National Economy. Commenting on the results of Yugoslav Prime Minister Milka Planinc's visit to Greece, which ended on 25th October,1983, Vaitsos said that the two countries had identical views as to the need of promoting their economic co-operation. During Milka Planinc's visit it was agreed that the mixed commission for economic co-operation should hold a ministerial-level meeting in Athens next January to specify arrangements on the enlargement of co-operation in the manufacturing industry, transport and tourism, said Vaitsos. Meat accounted for half the total Yugoslav exports before Greece entered the European Community, since when this amount has declined steeply. Economic experts point out that industrial co-production, joint ventures and marketing in third counties, together with enlarging the choice of commodities exchanged, make up the best possibilities for a stable development of the two counties' economic relations. Also emphasized was the significance of Yugoslav contractors' participation in the development of capital projects in Greece. At last year's tenders in Greece, Yugoslav enterprises were commissioned for work valued at some 20,000,000 dollars. At the tenders in progress, Yugoslav firms have fair prospects of signing 29,000,000 dollars worth of new contracts. These would include the deliveries of equipment for a hydro-electric power plant, participation in the electrification of railways and in the enlargement of the Athens subway network, and the construction of meat-packing plants and animal feed factories.

A session of the Yugoslav-Greek commission for economic cooperation, held in Athens in April 1985, was discussing long-term bilateral arrangements in the fields of energy and fuels, transport, agriculture and electronics. Yugoslavia expects that bilateral trade in 1985 will include new products and increase its volume by 20%. Last year, trade totaled 207m dollars, with a 43.2m dollar surplus recorded on the Yugoslav side. The Yugoslav enterprises Rade Koncar ad Litostroj, together with several Greek enterprises, provide and install equipment for a hydroelectric power plant in Greece, the Split shipyard is currently building five ships for Greece, while the Minel enterprise will deliver 32 large transformers to Greece. Yugoslavia also expects to export to Greece 10,000 cars manufactured by the Zastava factory. Greek exports to Yugoslavia mainly include agricultural products, raw materials and semi-manufactures, while the bulk of Yugoslav exports to Greece consist of food products, electricity and products of the machine-building, electrical and pulpwood processing industries.

On June 16, 1990, Greece protested to Yugoslavia and the European Community on Saturday after Yugoslav shopkeepers blocked the border between the two countries for the second time in a month.

"Not only is the border blocked illegally, but Greek-Yugoslav relations worsen dangerously," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Several hundred shopkeepers and craftsmen from the southern Yugoslav republic of Macedonia blocked the border with cars and trucks. Thousands of vehicles were backed up at the three border posts by early afternoon when a local radio station called for an end to the blockade, said Prokopios Mantzouranis, Greece's consul in the Macedonian capital of Skopje. Macedonia is one of the six republics that comprise Yugoslavia. Demonstrators were demanding the abolition of Greek visas for Yugoslavs and recognition for ethnic Macedonians in Greece. The demonstration was similar to a one-day border traffic blockade on May 19, 1990. Greece does not recognize Macedonians as an ethnic minority. The Foreign Ministry said that the Yugoslav ambassador in Athens was summoned "and the necessary representations were made." The Greek ambassador in Belgrade conveyed a similar protest to the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry. Greece also protested to the European Commission that Yugoslavia was isolating Greece from the rest of the community. Yugoslavia forms the principal land link between Greece and other European Community members.

Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic held discussions with the Greek premier on January 16, 1992, and told reporters later that Yugoslavia would continue to exist despite European Community recognition of Slovenia and Croatia. Milosevic flew to Athens a day after 11 EC member-states followed Germany's lead in recognizing the independence of Slovenia and Croatia. Greece, a member of the community, earlier worked to prevent the total breakup of the Yugoslav federation and expressed annoyance with Bulgaria for recognizing Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras said Greece would withdraw its support for Bulgarian attempts to join the EC because Sofia had ''hurried to recognize'' the breakaway republics despite earlier assurances to Athens that it would not do so. Greece has repeatedly expressed fears that the total disintegration of Yugoslavia would destabilize the Balkans. Milosevic, who held two hours of discussions with Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, told reporters later that the EC's recognition of Slovenia and Croatia ''does not mean that Yugoslavia has disappeared from the map.'' He said ''Yugoslavia will continue to exist as a distinct international entity,'' and expressed thanks to Greece for what he described as its ''positive'' role in the Yugoslav crisis. ''Greece's stance is invaluable and constructive,'' he said. Greece is particularly sensitive about international recognition for the Macedonian republic, which was known to harbor territorial ambitions on Greek territory. Athens wants the republic to stop using the name ''Macedonia,'' and to unequivocally declare that it has no claims to Greek territory.

On August 15, 1992, the growing possibility of international military intervention in Bosnia has kindled Greek fears of an uncontrolled war raging at its doorstep. "This is Greece's nightmare-that Yugoslavia could turn into another Lebanon and suck others into the conflict," Thanos Veremis, director of the Greek Foundation for Defense and Foreign Policy, said in an interview. The Greek government has said it is opposed to any kind of military intervention in former Yugoslavia. It worries that the U.N. Security Council's decision to authorize military action to help deliver food and medicine to Bosnia could lead to a shooting war with Serbia. Greece and Serbia, both predominantly Orthodox Christian, have strong traditional ties. And Greek leaders fear that the war could spread to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, on Greece's northern border, where there is a large ethnic Albanian minority. Foreign Minister Michalis Papaconstantinou said the government will try to convince its NATO and European Community partners that use of force "will not solve anything but only make things worse." "If we can't stop this decision, then Greece will not take part," he said. Government sources did say Greece will provide logistics support for NATO troops and aircraft operating from its airfields. Greece is participating in a United Nations embargo against Serbia and a NATO naval task force in the Adriatic. But in a rare show of political unity, Greece's Socialist, leftist and Communist opposition parties backed the conservative administration's decision not to get involved in Yugoslavia. "Our country, which directly neighbors with the embattled region, has to avoid any kind of military involvement. Not only because of our historical relations with Serbia, but because it has to be a stabilizing factor in the region," the opposition socialist party said.

On December 4, 2000, Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica voiced his willingness to strengthen Yugoslavia's relations with Greece, saying that good relations between the two countries have contributed to stability in the Balkan region. "Yugoslavia needs humanitarian aid at this time because of the sanctions, the bombings and its economic state. But it is not our intention to turn Yugoslavia into a country that depends on humanitarian aid but to develop its economy and its relations with abroad, as was the case with Greece, with whom relations have always been good and have contributed to stability in the Balkans, " Kostunica said after meeting with Greece's Macedonia-Thrace Minister George Paschalidis in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. Kostunica stressed that the traditionally friendly relations between the peoples of Serbia and Greece will never change. Kostunica arrived in Greece for a pilgrimage to the Serb Orthodox Monastery on Mount Athos, a semi-autonomous monastic community in northern Greece. The Yugoslav president will pay an official visit to Greece within this month, but the exact date has not been set.

On 16 January, 2001, Foreign Ministers Yeoryios Papandreou of Greece and Goran Svilanovic of Yugoslavia said after their meeting in Athens that a special interstate committee would soon be set up to tackle issues of importance for the promotion of all forms of bilateral cooperation. The committee will be headed by the two foreign ministers and other ministers will also join in its work later on. The agreement is in keeping with what was coordinated today in the dialogues between presidents Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia and Konstandinos Stephanopoulos of Greece and Prime Minister Konstandinos Simitis, Svilanovic told a press conference. He said he had discussed with his counterpart facilities in the mutual visa regime, which he said was of particular importance for Yugoslav citizens. Papandreou reiterated that Greece is interested in cooperation with Yugoslavia and assessed this was very important for the stability of the entire Balkan region.

Greece will assist Yugoslavia with economic and political aid in a bid to ease its integration into the European Union, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said in Belgrade on on May 10, 2002. "Yugoslavia needs help, as if it does not take part (in Europe) there can be no cooperation and peace in the Balkans," Beta news agency quoted Simitis as saying. Simitis, the first Greek premier to visit Yugoslavia in 17 years, arrived in Belgrade on May 10, 2002, for a series of meetings with top Yugoslav and Serbian officials. He said Greece has promised assistance to Belgrade in a bid to ease the "swift adhesion of Yugoslavia to the Euro-Atlantic structures, notably the Council of Europe and the European Union". Simitic told Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic that Athens would provide Yugoslavia with aid of 238 million Euros (217 million dollars) over the next four years.

Greece and Yugoslavia oppose any change of borders in the Balkans and will work together to preserve peace in the volatile region, the countries' defense ministers said on June 18, 2002. During talks between Greek Defense Minister Yannos Papantoniou and his Yugoslav counterpart, Velimir Radojevic, both officials agreed the two countries would strive for a greater level of security in the Balkan peninsula. Papantoniou stressed that Greece supports efforts of Yugoslavia's new democratic leadership-which overthrew former President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime-to bring the once ostracized country back into the European mainstream. As a NATO member, Greece is also sympathetic to Yugoslavia's hopes of joining the alliance's Partnership for Peace program, Papantoniou said. In April 2002, Yugoslavia applied to become part of the NATO program that allows non-NATO countries to participate in many alliance activities and aims to create stability and stronger ties among participants. Papantoniou also said that Greece would continue helping Yugoslavia upgrade its military schooling techniques as a preparation for joining the NATO program. Earlier this year, Greece promised to spend more than 530 million Euros (dollars 460 million) over the next five years as part of a plan to help reconstruct the Balkans following the wars that ravaged part of the region in the last decade. Some of those funds are expected to be gradually allocated to help build up the industrial, communications, energy and transportation sectors in Yugoslavia.

Greece and Yugoslavia on July 25, 2002, signed in northern Greek city of Salonica an agreement on aid that Athens will give to Belgrade under its Balkan reconstruction plan. The funding is set to total 250 million Euros (249.8 million U. S. dollars) over five years, the bulk of which will be used to spur investments and business activity. In addition, another 15 million Euros (14.99 million U.S. dollars) are to be allocated for Kosovo. Greece's reconstruction plan spanning a total of six Balkan countries totals 550 million Euros (549.5 million U.S. dollars), with Yugoslavia receiving the lion's share.

Greece fully supports Serbia-Montenegro's (SCG) endeavors for joining Partnership for Peace PfP and other Euro-Atlantic integration programs, SCG Defence Minister Boris Tadic said on July 7, 2003, after his initial talks with Greek officials at the start of his two-day visit to Athens. Tadic noted that Greek National Defense Minister Ioannos Papandoniou and parliament Vice-President Konstandinos Geikonas promised him that Greece will back SCG endeavors for getting the observer status at all NATO sessions. Tadic and Greek parliamentary officials also discussed inter-parliamentary cooperation in the sectors of defense, security and intelligence services. Tadic and Papandoniou conferred on the future development of bilateral cooperation and reached agreement on projects of military industry cooperation, as the two countries' systems in this field are complementary. Agreement was also reached on training courses for SCG Army officers at Greek military academies and on the sending of a Greek expert to the SCG Defense Ministry or General Staff to provide aid in implementing the reform of the sector, Tadic said.

The prime ministers of Greece and Serbia-Montenegro on October 31, 2005, said the final status of ethnically divided Kosovo should not be imposed on Belgrade, but reached through negotiation. The United Nations, which has administered Kosovo since NATO's 1999 air war against Yugoslavia, is due to start talks on the province's future within the next month. "A solution must be a result of dialogue, and this requires compromise and concessions on both sides," Serbia's Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said after talks with Greek counterpart Kostas Karamanlis. Kosovo's 90-percent ethnic Albanian majority wants independence, while the Belgrade-backed Serbian minority wants to remain part of Serbia. "We believe any solution must result from negotiations, and not be imposed," Karamanlis said. "We would like to see (a) multicultural Kosovo which fully respects the rights of all ethnic groups-this is the cornerstone of stability in the Balkans." Kostunica met President Karolos Papoulias and is scheduled to visit the Orthodox Christian sanctuary of Mount Athos in northern Greece.
