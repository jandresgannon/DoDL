CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1329 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, DRC announced that they would use "measures of extreme necessity." COW considers this a MID (a threat of force) against Congo, but GML argue this case should be dropped since this does not constitute a threat and was not directed. Coded civil war MID because, per cm narrative, DRC made this announcement after rebels from Congo Brazzaville crossed into DRC territory with the intention of overthrowing the government.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1325 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1325 from Gibler 2018, in 1969 a member of the opposition party in DRC attempted to assassinate the president but failed and fled to Congo. In Congo, he seized a radio station and announced that he was forming a new government, but Congolese forces took the station back. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to civil war activity in both DRC and Congo. Gibler 2018, COW, and other sources describe these two events as coup attempts, but the attempted overthrowers of the government were not members of the political or military elite in either country and are therefore considered rebels, making this a civil war MID and not a coup attempt.

However, GML recommend this case be dropped since they cannot find historical information on this MID to confirm the events actually took place. Coded uncertain, and coded civil war MID because COW claims this is connected to rebels in Congo planning to overthrow the Zairean government.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2150 from Gibler 2018, Zaire was facing a civil war in which rebels were trying to seize control of a mineral-rich region. Cuba and Angola were assisting the rebels, while Morooco, Egypt, France, and Belgium offered military assistance to the Zairean government. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Zaire, and coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Congo a party to this dispute.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3121 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3121 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, in 1980 Zaire amassed troops on the border with Congo because camps in Congo contained rebels that were targeting the Zairean government. This part of the MID is not disputed by GML, and we therefore code this a civil war MID. GML argue this case should be dropped for two reasons. First, the authors say "the show of force [by Zaire] targeted non-state actors." This does not prevent this incident from being a MID by our coding, since a state can be targeting rebels in another state, and that constitutes a civil war MID. Second, GML say that "there is decent evidence that the Congolese were acting to put down the insurgents targeting Zaire." However, even if the Congolese were trying to police the rebels in their teritory, a border buildup by Zaire targeting a rebel base in Congo still constitutes a civil war MID, as voluntary hosting of rebels in one's territory is not a necessary condition of a civil war MID involving cross-border rebels, by our coding scheme. Thus, since GML do not dispute the sufficient conditions we have for a civil war MID--a militarized border build-up in response to militraized rebels in the neighboring country--we retain this as a civil war MID despite GML's argument that the case be dropped.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2806 from Gibler 2018, in 1987 Zairean troops crossed into Congo, and Congolese forces responded. A clash ensued. Coded not civil war because although there were militarized rebels in Congo that were connected to other MIDs in this dyad, from BBC 1/27/1987, the Zairean soldiers crossed into Congo to extort civilians. This is therefore not connected to militarized rebels.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4069 from Gibler 2018, DRC seized sailors from the Congolese navy and accused them of smuggling weapons into DRC to aid rebels. The Congo denied this. Coded civil war MID because although it is unclear whether Congo was actually attempting to arm rebels, the DRC seized them under the suspicion that they were. This is therefore connected to militaried rebels in DRC, within this dyad.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Independence was granted to Congo Kinshasa and Congo Brazzaville on June 30, 1960 and August 15, 1960, respectively. Congo-Brazzaville and Congo-Kinshasa agreed to resume diplomatic relations on November 4, 1965. The countries severed diplomatic relations in October 1968. President Bongo of Gabon and President Hamani Diori of Niger unsuccessfully attempted to mediate a resolution of the dispute. The *Joint African and Malagasy Organization* (OCAM) heads-of-state established a three-member conciliation commission headed by President Eyadema of Togo on January 29, 1969. The President of Congo-Brazzaville accused the government of Congo-Kinshasa of subversion in November 1969. The countries severed diplomatic relations, but relations were restored in December 1970. Zairean troops killed two Congolese civilians on the island of Mbamou on the Zaire River in April 1976. Congolese troops and Zairean police clashed in the Mindouli region in January 1987, resulting in the deaths of two Zairean policemen and one Congolese soldier.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Independence was granted to Congo Kinshasa and Congo Brazzaville on June 30, 1960 and August 15, 1960, respectively. Congo Kinshasa proceeded to undergo serious turmoil for the next five years until Mobutu seized power. Immediately upon independence, Congo Brazzaville instituted a Marxist regime that lasted until 1990. Under the shadow of the Cold War, these two states became a site that was representative of the larger conflict between Western allied and Communist allied states. This, as well as support for rebel groups against each other's governments was the basis for their ongoing rivalry. Throughout the course of the next thirty-plus years, the two states were involved in this conflict which also included participation on opposite sides in the civil war in Angola.

On May 5th, 1961, Congo-Kinshasa(Leopoldville) closed down traffic on river Congo with Republic of Congo because of the criticisms of Congo's President Fulbert Youlou against Zairean leader Kasavubu. Mr. Youlou termed the arrest of the Zairean President, Mr. Thsombe as an act of banditry. With this incident, the relations between the two countries took a turn for the worse. In 1963, armed men from Congo Brazzaville crossed into the territory of Congo Kinshasa in order to overthrow the Kinshasa government in 1963 MID1329. A state of emergency was declared in Congo Kinshasa because of the support that was being provided to revolutionaries in Congo Brazzaville.

The two countries resumed diplomatic relations in November of 1965 after accusations by the Brazzaville government that Kinshasa forces had violated its borders at Kitanga and Mfouati MID1328 earlier that year. The two countries voiced a hope that this was just due to some uncontrolled gangs at the time, but eventually severed relations again in October of 1968.

The President of Congo-Brazzaville accused the government of Congo-Kinshasa of subversion in November 1969 MID1325. Diplomatic relations were restored in December of 1970.

In August of 1971, Zaire expelled the charge d'affaires from Brazzaville, accusing him of being complicit in an attempted coup by students at Louanium University. This is classified as MID2620. The two countries normalized relations on August 19, 1972 again.

In 1974, the government in Kinshasa (Zaire) officially endorsed a coalition government between UNITA, MPLA, and FNLA. Really, Zaire wished to exclude the leftist MPLA, which was based out of Congo Brazzaville. In 1975, when civil war broke out in Angola, Zaire officially moved its support to FNLA, who then formed a coalition with UNITA. While the Soviets, Eastern Europeans, and Cubans supported the MPLA, the United States, China, and South Africa were providing support to FNLA. The support of UNITA continued from the rightist Mobutu government in Zaire until the Bicesse accords in 1991 (and probably beyond).

Zairean troops killed two Congolese civilians on the island of Mbamou on the Zaire River in April 1976.

In March of 1977, rebel groups in Zaire had taken control of the Shaba Province in MID2150. In early May, President Mobutu of Zaire retook the area with the backing of Moroccan forces. It was believed that the rebel forces were communists, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. There was substantial fighting in this effort throughout May, 1977, and several countries became involved (including Congo-Brazzaville, Uganda, the Central African Republic, Egypt, Angola, and France).

In 1986, Mobutu began to publicly play the mediating role attempting to bring together MPLA and UNITA into a peace agreement. In April, 1989, Zaire, Congo, and Gabon met to reach such an agreement. They did reach an agreement in June, 1989, but it was not effective and fighting resumed.

Congolese troops and Zairean police clashed in the Mindouli region in January 1987, resulting in the deaths of two Zairean policemen and one Congolese soldier MID2806.

In 1988, the capitals of Kinshasa and Brazzaville were twinned and several cooperative agreements were reached. However, in December of 1991, Congo expelled hundreds of Zairians along with many other foreigners. At the time, there were 750,000 Zairians living in Congo as many had fled from the devastating riots in Kinshasa of September, 1991.

In May, 1991, MPLA and UNITA did sign a peace agreement which Mobutu had nothing to do with. In 1992, Congo Brazzaville had its first democratically elected government. While this removed the Marxist regime, it unleashed a wave of ethnic violence within the country.

On February 28, 1993, a ferry boat sank as it was crossing the Congo River killing at least 147 Zaireans who were being expelled from Congo Brazzaville because of illegal immigrant status. This was MID4069. Relations between the two countries became tense as some officials in Kinshasa questioned the circumstances surrounding the disaster. On November 7 of that year, in skirmishes along the border inside Congo Brazzaville, shells were fired that landed in Zaire, prompting a protest from Zaire's government.

In January of 1997, a brief civil war reinstituted the Marxist government. During this civil war, soldiers and military personnel from several neighboring countries became involved in the fighting. This is classified as MID4245. In the second DR Congo War (1998-1999), Congo-Brazzaville got involved and sent its troops on DRC's territory to fight the rebel groups which were pro-Lissouba (former president of Congo-Brazzaville). The Brazzaville authorities were displeased at the fact that Kabila's new regime did not end the support given to anti-Brazzaville rebel groups. There is no MID in the MIDs dataset for these militarized disputes in 1998 during the second DR Congo War. 

The obvious concern of the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] government to improve its human rights image is noteworthy. After being accused by the international community, the government of Laurent-Desire Kabila now seems to be giving serious consideration to the issue of respect for human rights in the country. The proof is this agreement signed on September 15, 1998, between Brazzaville and Kinshasa for the resettlement of Tutsis in neighboring Congo. A few days ago, forty of them were taken into care in Brazzaville by the Congolese Red Cross. The navy of the Democratic Republic of Congo arraigned on March 17, 1999, a ship owed by the Trans-Congolese Communication Agency of neighboring Republic of Congo. State radio reported Wednesday in Brazzaville the vessel 'O Bouya' was arraigned on the River Congo, 258 km upstream of Brazzaville, with 307 passengers on board, including 10 crew members. The radio did not give reasons for the ship's arraignment while no official reaction has come from Brazzaville or Kinshasa. The radio quoted the umbrella union of river transport workers as calling for the release of the ship and its crew. "The 1,136 ATC workers hold the DRC responsible for the consequences of this action," the statement said, deploring "repeated wild arraignments of Congolese ships on the right side of the river," Congolese (Brazzaville) territorial waters. The two countries share 1,000 km of river border and similar incidents have occurred in the past but they have always been settled amicably.

On May 20, 1999, The Congo-Brazzaville cabinet ratified the nonaggression pact signed between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC in Brazzaville on 29th December 1998 by Presidents Denis Sassou-Nguesso and Laurent-Desire Kabila. Ondonda When Presidents Kabila and Sassou Nguesso came to power, the DRC and the Republic of Congo maintained relations of mistrust stemming from the attitude both sides adopted during the June 1997 events. Fortunately, on 29th December 1998, the two countries signed a nonaggression pact. This is highly significant because it crowns the two countries' interest or political will to maintain trusting relations since the DRC and the Republic of Congo share blood ties and a long border.

Despite previous ideological differences, the two countries have always maintained cooperation based on interpersonal relations. For instance, there was the spirit of dialogue which prevailed in the resolution of the problem of the Congolese boat grounded in the DRC and the issue of the Bolobo rebels. This nonaggression pact regulates not only the relations between our two countries but also has an impact on the subregion since the two countries are currently engaged in resolving internal conflicts. These internal conflicts have real repercussions on the geopolitical situation of our subregion. This nonaggression pact, a highly significant pact, also reinforces the need for peace to develop economic and commercial exchange between the two sister countries. On May 19, 2000, Kinshasa and Brazzaville agreed on the need to speed up the implementation of the non-aggression pact signed in Brazzaville on 9th December 1998. This followed the visit which Jacques-Yvon Ndolou, the chief of general staff of the Republic of Congo, made to Kinshasa recently. Upon the invitation of the chief of general staff of the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC , Lt-Gen Sylvestre Lwecha; the chief of general staff of the Republic of Congo-Brazzaville, Gen Jacques-Yvon Ndolou, paid a working visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo from 16th to 19th May. During the visit, the chief of general staff of the Republic of Congo took part in the festivities marking the third anniversary of the liberation of the DRC. Concerned about the implementation of the various clauses of the non-aggression pact signed in Brazzaville in December 1998 in accordance with the consultations initiated by the two heads of state; concerned about the need to create the conditions for close ties and to establish confidence between the political and military authorities of the two countries; the two chiefs of general staff agreed to set up an evaluation and facilitation committee to promote good neighborliness. The terms and conditions for the establishment of the committee will follow a bilateral agreement between the two governments to be represented by their national defense ministers.

At the invitation of the government of the Republic of Congo, a delegation of the Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] led by His Excellency Mr Gaetan Kakudji, minister of state in charge of internal affairs, on 2nd October, 2000, visited Brazzaville, where it held discussions with the authorities of the Republic of Congo. The delegation of the Republic of Congo was led by His Excellency Mr Lekoundzou Iti Ossetoumba, minister delegate to the presidency in charge of national defence. During the discussions, which took place in a atmosphere of mutual understanding, the two delegations agreed on the urgent need to take practical steps for a comprehensive and lasting solution to all the problems of common interest. The problems are, notably those relating to the security of the two peoples, and to navigation on the international waters of the Congo and Oubangui Rivers. In this regard, they agreed on the following measures:
1. Holding in Brazzaville of the 10th session of the Congo-DRC Joint Commission on 30th October, 2000, at the latest.
2. Organizing before 17th October in Brazzaville or Kinshasa a meeting between the two countries and humanitarian organizations, notably the [UN]HCR and the ICRC with a view to settling the problem of refugees and the war displaced.
3. Convening a technical meeting on security issues in Brazzaville or Kinshasa before 30th October in pursuance of the non-aggression pact signed by the two countries, and of the tripartite security agreements signed on 3rd December 1999 in Luanda among the DRC, the Republic of Congo and the Republic of Angola.
4. Securing as soon as possible the signing and ratification by the DRC of the agreement instituting a single river transport system, and creating the International Congo-Oubangui-Sanga Basin Commission [Commission Internationale du Bassin du Congo-Oubangui-Sanga, CIBCOS].

On January 15, 2001, DRC forces bombed Boyele, a harbor community in Congo-Brazzaville. On the bombing of Boyele, in the northern part of Congo-Brazzaville, by DRC forces, Tam-Tam d'Afrique, an independent weekly, says that "the Congolese Armed Forces FAC and their allies often conduct actions in Congo-Brazzaville territory, which Laurent-Desire Kabila's regime accuses of supporting the rebels of the Congo Liberation Movement (Jean-Pierre Bemba's MLC). Tam-Tam d'Afrique notes that the two countries have accused each other of supporting the rebels, despite the signing of a non-aggression pact in December 1998. La Rue, a Brazzaville weekly close to the opposition, stresses that "this serious aggression, which is like an act of war, has created great agitation in official circles, both civilian and military". "The shockwave from the attack on Boyele has again interrupted river traffic on the Ubangi," La Rue writes further, adding that "the impact of this situation on the Central African Republic is that petroleum products imported from Brazzaville via Pointe-Noire can no longer reach Bangui, so there is a serious shortage of fuel". On February 17, 2001, President Joseph Kabila met with Congo-Brazzaville's foreign minister, Rodolphe Adada, who brought messages from his president, General Denis Sassou-Nguesso. The two acknowledged that the two closest capitals in the world-literally on opposite banks of the river Congo-live in total mistrust and suspicion. The DRC accused the Republic of Congo of frequent violations of the non-aggression pact, lack of sincerity, clashes between the troops of Jean-Pierre Bemba and those of the former Mobutu regime which were offered safe-heaven in Congo-Brazzaville. 

The tripartite summit in Angola among the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola is focused on disputes between the two Congos while the Angolan leader will help to clear distrust between Kinshasa and Brazzaville, local media reported on January 15, 2003. The summit, attended by Joseph Kabila, president of the DRC, Dennnis Sassou Nguesso, president of the Republic of the Congo and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda, Angola on Wednesday, aims to clear disputes between the Republic of the Congo and the DRC in order to promote a peace climate, a system of dialogues and regional cooperation in central Africa. Reports said that for the past months, observers noted a kind of cold war, suspicion and distrust between Brazzaville and Kinshasa. They accused each other to support rebel movements that fight their respective regimes. On June 25, 2004, DRC leaders accused Congo-Brazaville of allowing the funding for a tentative coup d'etat against Kabila to pass through its banks and financial institutions. There were no direct allegations against Brazzaville's involvement in the coup, however, the tone of the accusations was very strong. In October 2005, a group of more than 200 soldiers of the ex-FAZ of former Zairean President Mobutu, who currently found a safe heaven in Congo-Brazzaville attempted to go back to Kinshasa across the river Congo but where denied in their attempt. Congo-Brazaville offered a safe-heaven for thousands of Zaireans who were close to president Mobutu's regime. On June 25, 2006, President Laurent Kabila made an official visit to Congo-Brazzaville where he met with his counterpart, Denis Sassou-Nguesso. 

Because there still appears to be substantial conflict and instability within the region, I cannot claim that this series of conflicts is indeed terminated. Anti-Kabila forces are still present in Brazzaville and they receive the support of the government of Congo. The non-aggression pact of 1998 has been violated several times making it basically void. There are no signs that the conflict has de-escalated.
