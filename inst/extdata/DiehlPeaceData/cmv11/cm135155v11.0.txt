RIVNOTES: RIV10302 was originally coded as two rivalries, but these were combined because the last disputes (MID1181, MID1184, MID2048) all involve unresolved issues from the 1879 war. RIV304 also involves disputes related to that war, but over 50 years pass between disputes and therefore this rivalry is considered separate.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Chile and Peru fought the *War of the Pacific* from April 5, 1879 to January 18, 1881, after which the countries disputed the sovereignty of the provinces of Tacna and Arica. The countries signed the *Treaty of Ancon on October 20, 1883, which contained a provision requiring Chile to hold a plebiscite in the occupied provinces of Tacna and Arica in 1894. The plebiscite was to determine whether the provinces would be returned to Peru or would remain a part of Chile. After Chile failed to hold a plebiscite in 1894, Peru proposed that the territory should be turned over to a third country until a plebiscite could be held. Chile and Peru severed diplomatic relations in March 1901. Chile and Peru resumed diplomatic relations on October 21, 1905. Chile and Peru severed diplomatic relations on March 19, 1910. Peru made a request to the *League of Nations* (LON) Assembly to revise the *Treaty of Ancon* on November 1, 1920, but Peru withdrew the request on December 2, 1920. Chile proposed a plebiscite for the disputed territories on December 12, 1921, but Peru rejected the proposal on December 17, 1921. On January 17, 1922, President Warren Harding of the United States offered to facilitate negotiations between representatives from Chile and Peru in Washington DC. Chile accepted the offer on January 18, 1922, and Peru accepted the offer on January 19, 1922. Secretary of State Charles Hughes of the US mediated negotiations between representatives from Chile and Peru from May 15, 1922 to July 21, 1922. Chile and Peru signed a protocol of arbitration on July 20, 1922, which provided for US arbitration of the dispute concerning the Tacna-Arica plebiscite. President Harding accepted the role of arbitrator on January 29, 1923. President Calvin Coolidge issued a decision on March 4, 1925, which called for the establishment of a three-member commission (Chile, Peru, US) to administer a plebiscite in Tacna and Arica. President Harding appointed General John Pershing as chairman of the plebiscite commission on March 23, 1925. The plebiscite commission held its first formal meeting in Arica on August 5, 1925. Major-General William Lassiter was appointed as chairman of the plebiscite commission on January 12, 1926. The plebiscite commission adopted an election law on January 27, 1926. Some 61 US army officers arrived in Arica on February 23, 1926 to serve as election officials. The plebiscite commission was disbanded on June 21, 1926 after Peruvians refused to participate in the plebiscite. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg of the US began mediation on November 30, 1926, and the countries resumed diplomatic relations on October 3, 1928. Chile and Peru signed an agreement in Lima on June 3, 1929, which provided for the return of the province of Tacna to Peru on August 28, 1929 (Chile also agreed to provide Peru access to the port of Arica within 90 days). On January 8, 1977 both Chile and Peru began fortifying their borders with the other country. Peru moved military equipment to its southern provinces while Chile began defensive preparations along the northern desert border. In January 1979 Peru expelled Chile's ambassador and executed a former airman for having given military secrets to Chile. Chile and Peru signed an agreement on November 13, 1999, which finally provided for Peru's access to the Chilean port of Arica.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The period of rivalry in the 20th century between Chile and Peru resulted from its earlier conflicts over territory taken by Chile in the War of the Pacific that ended in 1884, MID1518 and MID1515. Thus, the rivalry is actually best described as a continuation of disputes over territory beginning in 1884. There are three mids before the War of the Pacific in 1879, MID1523, MID2242 and MID1503 but they do not seem to belong to the territorial claims brought about by the war.

MID1523 in 1852 involved Chile and Peru in the context of Peru's dispute with Colombia over the port of Leticia. MID2242 in 1860 is a one day dispute that appeared to be a border incursion by Chilean rebels into Peru. The information on this dispute, however, could not be accurately verified due to source limitations. Finally, MID1503, involved Peru's threat of force against Chile and Argentina in 1872 if either attacked Bolivia. It should be noted that this threat does lead to a defense treaty between Peru and Bolivia in 1873 and directly leads to Peruvian involvement in the War of the Pacific from which the dispute between Peru and Chile begins. Thus, MID1503 may actually fit with the disputes of the rivalry.

The three mids during this period after the War of the Pacific, MID1181, MID1184 and MID2048 were all skirmishes over territory brought about by unresolved claims due to the failure of the two countries to hold an agreed upon plebiscite to settle the claims after the war. Chile proposed another plebiscite for the disputed territories on December 12, 1921, but Peru rejected the proposal on December 17, 1921. On January 17, 1922, President Warren Harding of the United States offered to facilitate negotiations between representatives from Chile and Peru in Washington DC. Chile accepted the offer on January 18, 1922, and Peru accepted the offer on January 19, 1922. Secretary of State Charles Hughes of the US mediated negotiations between representatives from Chile and Peru from May 15, 1922 to July 21, 1922. Chile and Peru signed a protocol of arbitration on July 20, 1922, which provided for US arbitration of the dispute concerning the Tacna-Arica plebiscite. President Harding accepted the role of arbitrator on January 29, 1923.

On March 4, 1925 President Calvin Coolidge issued a decision which called for the establishment of a three-member commission (Chile, Peru, US) to administer a plebiscite in Tacna and Arica. President Harding appointed General John Pershing as chairman of the plebiscite commission on March 23, 1925. The plebiscite commission held its first formal meeting in Arica on August 5, 1925. Major-General William Lassiter was appointed as chairman of the plebiscite commission on January 12, 1926. The plebiscite commission adopted an election law on January 27, 1926. Some 61 US army officers arrived in Arica on February 23, 1926 to serve as election officials. The plebiscite commission was disbanded on June 21, 1926 after Peruvians refused to participate in the plebiscite. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg of the US began mediation on November 30, 1926, and the countries resumed diplomatic relations on October 3, 1928. Chile and Peru signed an agreement in Lima on June 3, 1929, which provided for the return of the province of Tacna to Peru on August 28, 1929 (Chile also agreed to provide Peru access to the port of Arica within 90 days).

As the agreement was reached relatively quickly, it seems that the most significant factor was highly active US participation in the role of mediator. Other possibilites are available as well, however. From 1924 until 1929, the Chilean government was constantly unstable. In 1924 Chile underwent a military coup against the Liberal government of Arturo Palma and established a dictatorship. This dictatorship was overthrown in 1925 by another military coup with Palma being returned to the presidency for less than a year. and replaced by Emiliano Figueroa in 1926. In 1927 Figueroa was replaced by Carlos Campo who remained president until 1931. This constant regime change made it difficult for the US, Chile and Peru to make gains on the territorial disputes as the US and Peru constantly had to come to terms with a new leadership. In contrast, the regime in Peru under Augusto Leguia was rather stable. Leguia in 1920 was actually beginning a new term in office where he would remain until 1930. Thus Peru could maintain a consistent position with regard to negotiations and provide the US as mediator a stable point from which to begin the resolution of the territorial issues.

While Bennett notes that the last three mids between Peru and Chile are minor and do not endanger the treaty settlement reached in 1929, it does appear that these border disputes (MID1191 on 9/11/76, MID2143 on 1/8/77, and MID3018 on 8/31/77) are a part of the territorial disputes that were seemingly settled by the Treaty of Ancon. In part, Peru still had aspirations of getting territory back from Chile. In addition, added pressure by Bolivia on both Peru and Chile to secure a water port for its country increased tensions in the region. According to the Treaty of Ancon, Chile must receive permission from Peru to transfer to a third party any territory it took from Peru in the War of the Pacific. Chile did offer Bolivia a narrow corridor on its border with Peru that would give it access to the Pacific but Peru refused to grant permission to do so. This tension over settling the dispute between the three countries over the region was seemingly responsible for the border skirmishes as both Chile and Peru began to increasingly fortify and mobilize forces in their respective northern and southern provinces. In addition, both countries also began purchasing arms to modernize their militaries in a continuous arms race that began as early as 1975 with Peru purchasing 36 Soviet fighter bombers and 300 Soviet tanks while Chile purchased 36 US and British fighter bombers. On September 10, 1977 the three presidents of Chile, Peru and Bolivia met in Washington, DC and issued a declaration agreeing to work toward a solution for Bolivian access to the sea. According to Bolivian officials, the meeting was the first time all three governments had met to discuss Bolivia's sea access because Peru had been harboring resentment toward Chile. On March 17, 1978 Bolivia suspended its diplomatic relations with Chile over the sea access dispute and placed troops along the border with Chile. Clearly these events affected Peru as well since the land in dispute was territory Chile had taken from Peru in the War of the Pacific. Bolivia's sea access issue still remains unresolved today. The rivalry between Chile and Peru then seems to be largely due to Peru's reluctance to accept the conditions of the Treaty of Ancon and Chile's insecurity with regard to a possible surprise attack by Peru to reclaim its lost territory. Peru's domestic economic problems in addition to border disputes with Ecuador, however, seemingly made it impossible for Peru to seriously consider a war with Chile over the lost territory after 1977. In December 1977, Peru ran into extreme economic difficulty, exhausting its foreign reserves and unable to pay its short-term debts. Peru asked the US for loans but was refused namely because Peru was due to pay off its purchases from the Soviets in January 1978. Peru finally achieved some stability with its international loans able to be rescheduled in January 1979 but this only amounted to a slight alleviation of its domestic economic ills. In 1979 Peru suffered a series of strikes: a general strike in January, a Copper strike in March and a teacher's strike in June, all demonstrating severe domestic strife with which the government was forced to deal. Additionally, the military government had promised to return the country to civilian rule in 1980 by holding presidential elections to support constituent assembly elections that occurred on June 18, 1978. This promise was completed on July 28, 1980 as Fernando Belaunde Terry was inaugurated as president after elections on May 18, 1980. Belaunde pledged to reduce arms expenditures and seek peaceful resolutions to disputes with its neighbors, including Chile. On January 28, 1981 Peru and Ecuador renewed fighting in a 165 year-old territorial dispute involving the Cordillera del Condor mountains. Representatives from Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the US appealed for the two sides to end the fighting but Peru remained determined to push back Ecuadorian troops that had penetrated eight miles into Peruvian territory. The fighting between the two countries ceased on March 6, 1981 with an agreement to have Brazil, Chile, the US and Argentina mediate the dispute. On July 12, 1982 President Belaunde issued a fourth state of emergency in the country, 3 regions in the central and southern parts specifically, due to increasing rebel guerilla attacks by the Sendero Luminos and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, groups who began attacking the government as early as May 1980. On September 10, 1982 the state of emergency was extended to Lima. By December 31, 1982 the Peruvian government was using the army to fight the rebels, thus further limiting its ability to pursue the rivalry with Chile. This guerilla conflict continued to intensify and increasingly command the attention of the Peruvian government. By 1989, the Sendero controlled territory from Ayacucho to Cajamarca, including significant areas of cocaine fields that served to finance the group. After 1989, further domestic strife continued to disrupt Peruvian governmental affairs, including the election of President Fujimori in 1990. His coming to power returned Peru to an authoritarian regime throughout the 1990s; an authoritarian regime largely focused on ending the civil conflict with the two guerilla groups.

Contrary to Peru, Chile in early 1978 appeared to be drastically improving economically, with the free-market economic policy of the Pinochet government dropping inflation from 350 percent in 1975 to 67 percent in 1977 and providing easy access to international loans. One reason that border issues and the rivalry could have ended with respect to Chile could be Chile's larger territorial issue over maritime rights with Argentina over a group of islands in the south which in May 1977 had failed to be resolved through international arbitration. Because of that failure both Argentina and Chile began building up its defenses and stationing their troops along their mutual 2,500 mile-border since May 1977. On November 8, 1978 Chile agreed with Argentina to seek a mediator to help resolve the dispute. On December 23, 1978 the Vatican began mediations between Argentina and Chile but nonetheless, Chile placed 45,000 troops on alert from its northern border with Peru in addition to its border with Argentina. This issue became less of a matter for Chile in April 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland islands. By January 23, 1984 Argentina and Chile signed a friendship pact to work toward a peaceful resolution of their dispute over the islands. This led to a treaty over the Beagle Channel that formally settled the dispute. This agreement with Argentina seemingly would have been a deterrent for Peru to initiate any further border disputes with Chile if it had been able. Domestically, the Chilean government began dealing with outside pressures to end the military rule of Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet had come to power in a military coup in 1973 and since that period the Chilean government had been accused of numerous human rights violations and maintaining a highly repressive military regime. On November 27, 1978 Western Hemisphere trade unions led by the AFL-CIO threatened to boycott Chile due to its repressive regime. In 1981, Chile's economy also took a downturn, sparking increased criticism of the Pinochet regime. In September of 1981 unemployment reached 12.4%. By May 1983, citizens began protesting against the governments economic policies on a widespread scale, with further protests occurring in September and October 1983. In November 1984, the Pinochet government imposed a state of siege in Chile and began severe repression on dissent within the state. The state of siege continued until June 16, 1985. On September 7, 1986 an attempted assassination on Pinochet led to the beginning of another state of siege. By 1988, the Chilean government began allowing opposition opinion and even held an election in which Pinochet was voted out of office, leading to new presidential elections in 1989. On December 15, 1989 Patricio Aylwin won the Chilean Presidential elections, replacing Pinochet and beginning a democratic rule for the first time since 1970. On November 18, 1999 foreign ministers from Chile and Peru signed a pact ending the last territorial dispute between the two counties with Peru gaining exclusive use of a pier in the port of Arica that would remain under Chilean sovereignty. With this pact it seems safe to state that Peru harbors no serious intentions of retrieving land by force against Chile.

SB-CR:
Chile / Peru Years: 1871-1929. Issues at stake: Border between Chile and Peru. End coding: In 1929 the Treaty of Ancon settled the border in the Tacna-Arica region. This followed an arbitration protocol of 1923. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: Last militarized dispute: 1921. Wars: 1879-1884. Summary: A series of disputes beginning in 1871 and culminating in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883 mark the beginning of the Peruvian-Chilean Rivalry. As discussed above in the Bolivian-Chilean rivalry, Bolivia and Peru became discontent with the economic benefits Chile was getting from the mineral rich areas in the areas of their mutual border. Peru was particularly concerned with the benefits Chile was getting from Peru's southernmost province, Tarapaca. Bolivia and Peru signed a secret defense agreement directed at Chile in 1873. War broke out in 1879 following Bolivia's seizure of Chilean property in the Bolivian province of Atacama. Chile used the seizure as an excuse to declare war on both Bolivia and Peru. It destroyed the Peruvian and Bolivian navies, captured the Bolivian coastal province of Atacama, denying Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean, and captured the southern Peruvian provinces of Tarapaca, Tacna, and Arica (the Tacna and Arica regions are at the intersection of Peru, Bolivia, and Columbia). The 1883 Treaty of Ancon was to settle the dispute, with Tarapaca going to Chile and the disposition of Tacna and Arica to be determined by plebiscite. However, for a variety of reasons, including a series of changes of government in Peru and a number of procedural arguments, the plebiscite was never held, and the dispute over ownership of those territories continued. Militarized confrontations occurred in 1897, 1911, and 1920-21. Following the 1921 dispute, a settlement was finally reached through a 1923 arbitration protocol and US mediation. The 1929 Treaty of Ancon returned Tacna to Peru, and gave Arica to Chile. This settlement has not been challenged. Notes: The COW Militarized Dispute data set contains a series of disputes between 1976 and 1978 (a border clash and troop movements). While these occur in the Tacna-Arica region, they are minor and do not constitute a renunciation of the treaty settlement, and are not extensive enough to constitute the beginning of a new rivalry.

On November 16, 1948 Chile closed its border with Peru because Peruvian troops prevented the export of foods to the Arica region of North Chile. The border between Chile and Peru was reopened the next day after the Peruvian military authorities lifted the embargo on exports to Chile. The Foreign Ministers of Chile and Peru signed a commercial agreement on December 18, 1950 broadening the terms of the trade treaty arranged by both countries in 1941. The agreement provides for special tariff concessions by Chile on Peruvian cotton, and by Peru on Chilean iron and steel. In December 1959, President Jorge Alessandri criticized the Peruvian government for acquiring another warship from Britain. He said this action was not in the spirit of anti-armament initiative Peru agreed to. In 1962 Chile severed diplomatic relations with the military junta in Peru. However, one month later they recognized the military leadership of the country. Throughout the whole period Chile did not implement the requirements of the 1929 agreement to provide Peru access to the port of Arica. Both Chile and Peru began to increasingly fortify and mobilize forces in their respective northern and southern provinces. In addition, both countries also began purchasing arms to modernize their militaries in a continuous arms race that began as early as 1975 with Peru purchasing 36 Soviet fighter bombers and 300 Soviet tanks while Chile purchased 36 US and British fighter bombers.

While Bennett notes that the last three mids between Peru and Chile are minor and do not endanger the treaty settlement reached in 1929, it does appear that these border disputes (MID1191 on 9/11/76, MID2143 on 1/8/77, and MID3018 on 8/31/77) are a part of the territorial disputes that were seemingly settled by the Treaty of Ancon. In part, Peru still had aspirations of getting territory back from Chile. In addition, added pressure by Bolivia on both Peru and Chile to secure a water port for its country increased tensions in the region. According to the Treaty of Ancon, Chile must receive permission from Peru to transfer to a third party any territory it took from Peru in the War of the Pacific. Chile did offer Bolivia a narrow corridor on its border with Peru that would give it access to the Pacific but Peru refused to grant permission to do so. This tension over settling the dispute between the three countries over the region was seemingly responsible for the border skirmishes as both Chile and Peru began to increasingly fortify and mobilize forces in their respective northern and southern provinces. In addition, both countries also began purchasing arms to modernize their militaries in a continuous arms race that began as early as 1975 with Peru purchasing 36 Soviet fighter bombers and 300 Soviet tanks while Chile purchased 36 US and British fighter bombers. On September 10, 1977 the three presidents of Chile, Peru and Bolivia met in Washington, DC and issued a declaration agreeing to work toward a solution for Bolivian access to the sea. According to Bolivian officials, the meeting was the first time all three governments had met to discuss Bolivia's sea access because Peru had been harboring resentment toward Chile. On March 17, 1978 Bolivia suspended its diplomatic relations with Chile over the sea access dispute and placed troops along the border with Chile. Clearly these events affected Peru as well since the land in dispute was territory Chile had taken from Peru in the War of the Pacific. Bolivia's sea access issue still remains unresolved today. The rivalry between Chile and Peru then seems to be largely due to Peru's reluctance to accept the conditions of the Treaty of Ancon and Chile's insecurity with regard to a possible surprise attack by Peru to reclaim its lost territory. Peru's domestic economic problems in addition to border disputes with Ecuador, however, seemingly made it impossible for Peru to seriously consider a war with Chile over the lost territory after 1977. In December 1977, Peru ran into extreme economic difficulty, exhausting its foreign reserves and unable to pay its short-term debts. Peru asked the US for loans but was refused namely because Peru was due to pay off its purchases from the Soviets in January 1978. Peru finally achieved some stability with its international loans able to be rescheduled in January 1979 but this only amounted to a slight alleviation of its domestic economic ills. In 1979 Peru suffered a series of strikes: a general strike in January, a Copper strike in March and a teacher's strike in June, all demonstrating severe domestic strife with which the government was forced to deal. Additionally, the military government had promised to return the country to civilian rule in 1980 by holding presidential elections to support constituent assembly elections that occurred on June 18, 1978. This promise was completed on July 28, 1980 as Fernando Belaunde Terry was inaugurated as president after elections on May 18, 1980. Belaunde pledged to reduce arms expenditures and seek peaceful resolutions to disputes with its neighbors, including Chile. On January 28, 1981 Peru and Ecuador renewed fighting in a 165 year-old territorial dispute involving the Cordillera del Condor mountains. Representatives from Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the US appealed for the two sides to end the fighting but Peru remained determined to push back Ecuadorian troops that had penetrated eight miles into Peruvian territory. The fighting between the two countries ceased on March 6, 1981 with an agreement to have Brazil, Chile, the US and Argentina mediate the dispute. On July 12, 1982 President Belaunde issued a fourth state of emergency in the country, 3 regions in the central and southern parts specifically, due to increasing rebel guerilla attacks by the Sendero Luminos and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, groups who began attacking the government as early as May 1980. On September 10, 1982 the state of emergency was extended to Lima. By December 31, 1982 the Peruvian government was using the army to fight the rebels, thus further limiting its ability to pursue the rivalry with Chile. This guerilla conflict continued to intensify and increasingly command the attention of the Peruvian government. By 1989, the Sendero controlled territory from Ayacucho to Cajamarca, including significant areas of cocaine fields that served to finance the group. After 1989, further domestic strife continued to disrupt Peruvian governmental affairs, including the election of President Fujimori in 1990. His coming to power returned Peru to an authoritarian regime throughout the 1990s; an authoritarian regime largely focused on ending the civil conflict with the two guerilla groups.

Contrary to Peru, Chile in early 1978 appeared to be drastically improving economically, with the free-market economic policy of the Pinochet government dropping inflation from 350 percent in 1975 to 67 percent in 1977 and providing easy access to international loans. One reason that border issues and the rivalry could have ended with respect to Chile could be Chile's larger territorial issue over maritime rights with Argentina over a group of islands in the south which in May 1977 had failed to be resolved through international arbitration. Because of that failure both Argentina and Chile began building up its defenses and stationing their troops along their mutual 2,500 mile-border since May 1977. On November 8, 1978 Chile agreed with Argentina to seek a mediator to help resolve the dispute. On December 23, 1978 the Vatican began mediations between Argentina and Chile but nonetheless, Chile placed 45,000 troops on alert from its northern border with Peru in addition to its border with Argentina. This issue became less of a matter for Chile in April 1982 when Argentina invaded the Falkland islands. By January 23, 1984 Argentina and Chile signed a friendship pact to work toward a peaceful resolution of their dispute over the islands. This led to a treaty over the Beagle Channel that formally settled the dispute. This agreement with Argentina seemingly would have been a deterrent for Peru to initiate any further border disputes with Chile if it had been able. Domestically, the Chilean government began dealing with outside pressures to end the military rule of Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet had come to power in a military coup in 1973 and since that period the Chilean government had been accused of numerous human rights violations and maintaining a highly repressive military regime. On November 27, 1978 Western Hemisphere trade unions led by the AFL-CIO threatened to boycott Chile due to its repressive regime. In 1981, Chile's economy also took a downturn, sparking increased criticism of the Pinochet regime. In September of 1981 unemployment reached 12.4%. By May 1983, citizens began protesting against the governments economic policies on a widespread scale, with further protests occurring in September and October 1983. In November 1984, the Pinochet government imposed a state of siege in Chile and began severe repression on dissent within the state. The state of siege continued until June 16, 1985. On September 7, 1986 an attempted assassination on Pinochet led to the beginning of another state of siege. By 1988, the Chilean government began allowing opposition opinion and even held an election in which Pinochet was voted out of office, leading to new presidential elections in 1989. On December 15, 1989 Patricio Aylwin won the Chilean Presidential elections, replacing Pinochet and beginning a democratic rule for the first time since 1970. On November 18, 1999 foreign ministers from Chile and Peru signed a pact ending the last territorial dispute between the two counties with Peru gaining exclusive use of a pier in the port of Arica that would remain under Chilean sovereignty. With this pact it seems safe to state that Peru harbors no serious intentions of retrieving land by force against Chile.

On November 19, 1999, when the two countries signed an act of execution completing the implementation of the bilateral Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed in 1929.In 2000, relations between Chile and Peru were at their best for many years and are likely to improve further, helped by increasing cross-border trade and investment, along with a deepening integration of energy distribution and transport networks. Terminal 7 at the far northern port of Arica, Region I, was handed over to Peru in February 2000 under the terms of a 1929 peace treaty between Chile and her northern neighbor which settled outstanding issues from the 1880s War of the Pacific. Under the agreement, Peru will have complete control of the terminal along with customs offices and a railroad station to link Arica to Lima. The National Ports Company of Peru (Enapu) will be responsible for operating the facilities. However, Chile's relations with Peru have cooled in 2003 as a result of pressures from Peru to revise the maritime limits agreed by the two countries in 1952. Nevertheless, co-operation on fishing policy continues, and the Peruvian and Chilean navies will carry out joint exercises twice in 2003. In September 2004 the maritime border dispute between the two countries became an open issue of contention. Chile maintains that the maritime demarcation between Chile and Peru was initially established in 1947 and then reaffirmed in 1952 after the two countries, plus Ecuador and Bolivia, held talks on the issue. The position of Chile is based on international treaties that not only involve Peru and Chile, but also Ecuador, whose position on the issue is clearly known and is the same as Chile's. Peru threatened to resort to the International Court of Justice in The Hague should Chile fail to solve the dispute in 60 days through a direct diplomatic approach. Peruvian Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez said the issue is a priority in Peru's foreign policy. Peru demands a review of the maritime demarcation in the Pacific Ocean concerning an area of 30,000 square km. But Chilean Foreign Minister Soledad Alvear said Chile has not received any official information from Peru on the demand for a border revision. In 2004, the two countries were arming themselves amid renewed border quarrels. The Peruvian government criticized Chile's purchase of four new missile frigates from the Netherlands. Defense analysts believe that Chile's build-up has influenced Peru's decision to double from two to four the number of Lupus-class frigates that it's buying from Italy this year. In surprising declarations during a routine visit to Santiago, The Peruvian Deputy Foreign Minister Luis Solari told the press that "the question of maritime delimitation which remains pending according to our understanding has been put before the Chilean government." He suggested that the issue be decided through international courts. Clearly irritated, Chilean Foreign Ministry officials responded that the matter was not being discussed and called on Peru to abstain from its "pretensions." Tensions have been further exacerbated by a recent border incident in which Chilean marines shot and killed a Peruvian civilian who was allegedly crossing into Chile illegally. Peru's Foreign Ministry has demanded that Chile apologize and go public with a full investigation while the Peruvian press has launched vitriolic attacks on the neighboring nation. The Peruvian newspaper Expresso denounced Chile for acting like an "outlaw state." Peruvian politicians even publicly accuse Chilean pilots on commercial flights over-flying Peru of conducting electronic espionage on military units massed along the southern frontier. However, the Peruvian president added in 2004 that Peru seeks to improve relations with Chile and that recognizing that there is a problem and then solving it is an important step toward that goal. Toledo's comments are the latest in a low-level maritime boundary dispute, fueled by a handful of retired Peruvian admirals, that has simmered in conservative Peruvian tabloids. Former Chilean President Eduardo Frei told reporters during a visit to Peru in 2004 that he and former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori signed agreements closing the matter in 1999. But Peru's foreign minister at the time, Fernando de Trazegnies, told newspapers that Fujimori said that there were no pending land-based territorial disputes, but did not mention the maritime boundaries-leaving them open do debate. In August 2004, Chile conducted a military drill near its border with Peru on Thursday against the background that the bilateral relations are in tension because of their dispute over maritime boundary. The drill, involving 290 troops, was overseen by Chilean Defense Minister Michelle Bachelet and Army Commander Juan Cheyre. New mobile military engineering vehicles that can sweep land-mines and set up bridges were used in the exercise, said the ministry. Peru insists that Chile agree to negotiations to redefine their maritime borderline and reclaim about 30,000 square km of sea. Chile says the issue was settled 50 years ago through a treaty on maritime border demarcation. The relations between Chile and Peru have become more tense following a recent statement by Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo that Chile had agreed to review the 1929 border demarcation treaty. Chilean Foreign Minister Soledad Alvear rebuffed Toledo's remarks immediately. Earlier, Peruvian Defense Minister Roberto Chiabra said Peru's armed forces were prepared for a conflict with Chile. The latest dispute between Peru and Chile in May 2005 involved alleged Chilean arms sales to Ecuador during its war with Peru in the 1990s. Chile acknowledged it sold arms to Ecuador before the brief war began in 1995. Peruvian Prime Minister Carlos Ferrero said he was disappointed that Chile has never apologized for the sales, which Peru maintains continued during the war over a section of the Ecuador-Peru border. He went on to announce that Peru is canceling free trade and confidence building talks with Chile due to the increasing tensions. Chilean officials responded by issuing a statement saying they were willing to sit down with their Peruvian counterparts to discuss a resolution. Peru was also riled by a travel video released recently by a Chilean airline that portrays Peru as poor and filthy. Earlier this week, Peru refused to endorse Chile's candidate for secretary-general of the Organization of American States. Peru's Congress passed a bill on November 3rd, 2005, to redefine the country's ocean territory as a first step toward claiming rich Pacific fishing waters now controlled by Chile, raising nationalistic tensions brewing between the two nations since a war more than a century ago. The new law, approved in a 98-0 vote, creates shore reference points to enable Peru to move the ocean boundary between the two countries farther south, encompassing a triangular area spanning about 37,900 square kilometers (14,781 square miles). Chile maintains the maritime border was set by agreements signed between the two nations in 1952 and 1954, but Peru contends the documents were pacts covering fishing rights and that the maritime boundaries in the area have never been clearly defined. Peru suspended talks on the South American gas pipeline project due to be held in Buenos Aires from November 7-9, 2005, due to a diplomatic dispute with Chile. The decision was the result of a diplomatic row that erupted between Chile and Peru over a new Peruvian law that allows Lima to redefine the maritime border between the two countries. The dispute was compounded by Chile's arrest of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in Santiago on Monday, although the arrest was a result of a request from the Peruvian government. On August 22, 2006, Chile and Peru finally signed an agreement that expands the existing Chile-Peru Economic Complementation Agreement (ECA) of 1998 by including chapters on the treatment of cross-border investment and on trade in services. The agreement also tightens dispute settlement procedures in line with international standards. The deal is not a fully fledged FTA, since it does not deal with items such as financial services, public procurement or free zones, and does not improve on the merchandise trade liberalization schedule established in the ECA. However, it will facilitate cross-border trade and investment through the new legal guarantees and, possibly more importantly, through the clear break the newly inaugurated Peruvian president, Alan Garc'a, has made with the policies of his predecessor, Alejandro Toledo, who sought to antagonize Chile in an effort to regain popularity. By visiting Chile before he was inaugurated, and signing the FTA less than a month after taking office, Mr Garc'a has signaled his willingness to refocus bilateral relations towards cooperation rather than conflict. In return, Ms Bachelet was not only present at Mr Garc'a's inauguration ceremony in Lima on July 28th, but stood next to him also at the subsequent military parade, and joined him in singing Peru's national anthem. Chile also invited Peru to join the TransPacific accord (generally referred to as P4) it has signed with Brunei, New Zealand and Singapore. Chilean companies, which have already invested about US$5bn in Peru, are eager to invest further in the country owing to its macroeconomic stability, strong economic growth, and the fact that it has been adopting a policy orientation similar to Chile's. Peruvian investments in Chile are still small, adding up to less than US$50m, but appear set to increase sharply in the coming years. The president of Peru, Alan Garc'a, might seek to ease a simmering maritime border row with Chile by taking the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. On May 10th the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Chile, Mar'a Fern‡ndez Espinosa and Alejandro Foxley, issued a declaration ratifying the trilateral treaties on maritime limits that the two countries signed with Peru in the early 1950s, which define the maritime borders between the three countries as the geographic parallels in front of their coastal borders. The declaration follows Peru's registration in April to the UN of a redefinition of its maritime borders in accordance with a law approved by the Peruvian Congress in November 2005 that defines its maritime border with Chile as a continuation of the line that forms the two countries' border. Peru contends that the 1950s agreements were pacts covering fishing rights and that the maritime boundaries in the area have never been clearly defined. This was a major step back in relations between Peru and Chile since all bilateral border issues were meant to have been settled in November 1999, when the two countries signed an act of execution completing the implementation of the bilateral Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed in 1929.
