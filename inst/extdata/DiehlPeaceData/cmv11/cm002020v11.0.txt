MARITMID-CER: MID2952 3 -- uncertain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID2952 from cm narrative, the US and Canada had long-running maritime disputes, but MID2952 was not connected to this issue. The US seized Candian fishing vessels that were illegally fishing in US waters near Washington (Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016). Coded not maritime because this was not connectde to the disputed maritime boundaries elsewhere (primarily in the Gulf of Maine). Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped as there was no protest from the Canadians. 

ISLMID: MID2952 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID2952 3 -- uncertain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID2952 US-Canada rivalry was centered on maritime issues that involved 4 disputed maritime boundaries and a disputed island in the Gulf of Maine, Machias Island, but this MID did not involve the disputed islands. Coded uncertain because Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016 recommend this MID be dropped as there was no protest from the Canadians.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID2953 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, the US seized a Canadian fishing vessel in waters near Seattle. Coded maritime MID because these waters are disputed due to competing claims of fishing rights in the area, one of several such maritime disputes between US and Canada. Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped as the Canadians did not protest. 

ISLMID: MID2953 3 -- not islands

MARITMID-CER: MID2968 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID2968 per the cm narrative, Canadian authorities seized several US fishing boats. the US-Canada rivalry was centered on a disputed maritime boundary connected to conflicting claims for fishing rights in the disputed waters. At the time of this MID, the maritime boundary was still being disputed. Coded maritime MID because boundary was disputed, was connected to fishing rights, and fishing vessels were seized. 

ISLMID: MID2968 3 -- not islands
ISLMID-CER: MID2968 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID2968 US-Canada rivalry was centered on several maritime issues. The disputed area which produces the most conflict is the Gulf of Maine, and the Machias Island in this gulf is claimed by both countries. This is a separate dispute from that maritime dispute, involving fishing resources in the Georges Bank. Coded not islands because fishing in the Georges Bank is at the heart of the Gulf of Maine maritime dispute, and the maritime boundary that would be drawn if the Machias Island dispute was settled would not affect the Georges Bank. The Machias Island dispute produces no conflict and neither country cares about this dispute enough to bother negotiating over it (Globe and Mail 2012).

MARITMID: MID3900 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID3900 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3900 from cm narrative, a US vessel was fishing in disputed waters and was ordered to stop by a Canadian destroyer. The US vessel did not comply with Canadian orders to allow them to board and inspect the ship and a pursuit ensued, with the US vessel heading for US waters. At one point, the two boats collided and the Canadian destroyer fired a warning shot across the bow of the US vessel. Coded maritime MID because clash began in disputed waters and was triggered by fishing rights, one of the reasons for the rivalry. 

ISLMID: MID3900 3 -- not islands
ISLMID-CER: MID3900 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID3900 US-Canada rivalry involved the maritime boundary disputation within the Gulf of Maine. The Gulf of Maine contains a disputed island, Machias Island, and a disputed area of fishing resources, the Georges Bank. The ownership of Machias Island has implications for the maritime boundary, but not for fishing rights in the Georges Bank. They are separate issues that are non-overlapping, both geographically and in terms of bargaining. It seems that the island only remains disputed because it is too unimportant to bother negotiating over (Globe and Mail 2012). Coded not islands because neither the islands nor the associated disputed maritime boundary drove the dispute; the disputed Georges Bank did.

MARITMID-CER: MID3972 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3972 from cm narrative, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Canadian fishing boat in waters claimed by Canada. Coded maritime MID because maritime boundary was disputed, seizure happened in disputed waters, and the seizure was of a fishing vessel (fishing rights partly fueled the dispute).

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4183 from cm narrative, Canada seized 4 US boats fishing after negotiations on fishing quotas broke down with the US. this particular seizure did not happen in disputed waters, but coded maritime MID because a maritime dispute was active, fishing rights were at the heart of the maritime dispute, and the incident happened after negotiations broke down. MID4183 is therefore a product of the maritime boundary dispute.

NO MILITARIZED ACTION 

Between May 25, 1997 and May 27, 1997 Canada seized four American fishing boats in the Pacific Northwest after Salmon quota negotiations between the two states broke down. Canada has repeatedly charged the United States with overfishing in the area. All four boats were released after their Captains appeared in Canadian court and paid a fine. 19970525 -19970528 First day of dispute was on 5/25/1997 and last day of dispute was on 5/28/1997.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Canada and the United States disputed their maritime border on the Gulf of Maine beginning on November 5, 1969, when the US asserted that the Northeast Channel should be the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine. Canada and the US signed the Fisheries Agreement and the Boundary Settlement Treaty on March 29, 1979, providing for the submission of the Gulf of Maine dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or an ad hoc arbitration tribunal. President Ronald Reagan of the US withdrew the Fisheries Agreement from Senate ratification on March 6, 1981.

SOURCES-CM:

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the United States and Canada has to do with several resource disputes including the delimitation of the maritime boundary between the two countries in the Gulf of Maine; salmon fishing quotas in the Pacific and timber resources in the plains states area. 

The geographic area in which there seems to be the most conflict is the Gulf of Maine. It is the body of water that extends from Cape Cod in the south to Nova Scotia in the North. Of particular interest in this region are fish stocks that are abundant in one particular region-Georges Bank. It is unclear based on the Law of the Sea Treaty's provisions which country has fishing rights to this region. 

In 1964, Canada issued oil and gas permits for tracts situated on the northeastern sector of Georges Bank. The United Sates vigorously opposed this action in 1969. The US and Canada began formal negotiations on this dispute in 1970 but during the decade it was clear that no agreement would be reached.

In 1976, the United States and Canada both enacted legislation establishing two hundred mile exclusive fisheries zones as is permissible under the Law of the Sea Treaty. However, the claims of the two nations significantly overlapped. This overlap caused considerable friction and tension between the two countries especially with respect to the resource rich Georges Bank region.

In November of 1976, Canada published coordinates for what it considered to be the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine region. The Canadian coordinates placed one third of Georges bank under Canadian control. The United States responded immediately by published its own coordinates which placed Georges Bank fully under US control. 

MID2952 is a seizure initiated by the United States involving Canada. On September 14 1974, an American draft evader was arrested by U.S. Customs agents on the Canadian side of the U.S.-Canadian border on August 24 and released after Canadian protests on August 30 

MID2953 is a seizure involving the United States and Canada, September 2 1975. There is no mention of this event in the Facts on File, Keesings Contemporary Archives, the New York Times, or Lexis Nexus World News Archive. 

MID2968 occurred from August 28 through August 31 of 1979. In this dispute, Canadian authorities seized several U.S. fishing boats. 

MID3900 occurred on December 12, 1989. An American fishing vessel, the Concordia, was fishing on the Georges Bank in Canadian territorial waters. A Canadian destroyer was in the region and asked the vessel to stop so it could be boarded for inspection of its catch. The Concordia did not stop and headed for American waters and its homeport on Cape Cod. The Canadian destroyer, the Saguenay, pursued the Concordia for an entire day. At one point, the two boats collided. It is not clear which boat was the aggressor in the contact. Late in the day the Canadians fired a warning shot over the bow of the Concordia but she did not stop. The Canadians abandoned their pursuit at about twelve miles east of Cape Cod. 

MID3972 occurred on July 29, 1991. Here the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Canadian fishing boat in waters claimed by Canada.

MID4183. Between May 25, 1997 and May 27, 1997 Canada seized four American fishing boats in the Pacific Northwest after Salmon quota negotiations between the two states broke down. Canada has repeatedly charged the United States with over-fishing in the area. All four boats were released after their Captains appeared in Canadian court and paid a fine. 

As of summer 2003, the disputes do not seem to have been resolved. Despite the fact that there is a panel composed of members of both countries working to solve this border issue, fisherman from both countries continue to work the disputed territories. However, a number of authors note that the danger of military confrontation between the U.S. and Canada `ended in the last century' Curtis and Carroll (1983, 12; See also Doran, 1984 and Bothwell 1992.) 

In fact, some consider the bilateral relationship to be among the strongest in the world. It is reflected in the staggering volume of trade (over $1.4 billion a day) and people (over 200 million a year) crossing the U.S.-Canadian border. In fields ranging from environmental cooperation to free trade, the two countries have set the standard by which many other countries measure their own progress. In addition to their close bilateral ties, Canada and the U.S. also work closely through multilateral organizations.

Although Canada views its relationship with the U.S. as crucial to a wide range of interests, the two country's policies are often at odds. This is particularly true of Cuba, with regard to which the U.S. and Canada have pursued divergent policies for nearly 40 years, even while sharing the common goal of a peaceful democratic transition. 

The bilateral relationship between Canada and the United States is of extreme importance to Canada. About 85% of Canadian trade is with the United States and Canada is dependent upon the United States for security. While there are disputed issues between the two nations, relations are close and the two countries share the "world's longest undefended border." Canada was a close ally of the United States in both World Wars the Korean War and the Cold War. Canada was an original member of NATO and the two countries air defenses are merged in NORAD. 

Following co-operation in the two World Wars, Canada and the United States lost much of their previous animosity. As Britain's influence as a global superpower declined, Canada and the US became extremely close partners. Canada was a close ally of the United States during the Cold War. 

The Canadian military supported the US in most major wars, including the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and the War on Terror. The main exceptions to this were the Canadian government's opposition to the Vietnam War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which caused some brief diplomatic tensions. Despite these issues military relations have remained close. 

U.S. defense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country. The Permanent Joint Board on Defense, established in 1940, provides policy-level consultation on bilateral defense matters. The United States and Canada share NATO mutual security commitments. In addition, U.S. and Canadian military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within the framework of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). 

Canada and the United States have the world's largest trading relationship with huge quantities of goods and people flowing across the border each year. Since the 1988 Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement, there have been no tariffs on most goods passed between the two countries. With such a massive trading relationship, trade disputes between the two countries are frequent and inevitable. American firms have complained about subsidies to softwood lumber, the Canadian Wheat Board, and Canadian cultural restrictions on magazines and television. Canadians have complained about such things as the ban on beef since a single case of Mad Cow disease was discovered in 2003 and the high American agricultural subsidies. 

The two countries also work closely to resolve trans-boundary environmental issues, an area of increasing importance in the bilateral relationship. A principal instrument of this cooperation is the International Joint Commission (IJC), established as part of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 to resolve differences and promote international cooperation on boundary waters. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1972 is another historic example of cooperation in controlling trans-boundary water pollution. The two governments also consult semiannually on trans-boundary air pollution. Under the Air Quality Agreement of 1991, both countries have made substantial progress in coordinating and implementing their acid rain control programs and signed an annex on ground level ozone in 2000. 

In short, the relationship between the US and Canada has a strong positive character and the threat of violence between the two countries appears to be very low and was so during the rivalry. Therefore, this rivalry merits consideration as to whether it belongs in the list of rivals. Although the two states did engage in several mids from 1974 until 1997, the relationship did not encounter a period in which either considered the possibility of war or militarization. Throughout the rivalry period, the two states remained close allies and participated jointly in military operations against other states including the Gulf War. Thus, this rivalry seems to one that merits exclusion from the dataset.

Kim Mackrael, “Canada, Denmark closer to settling border dispute,” The Globe and Mail (29 November 2012) http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-denmark-closer-to-settling-border-dispute/article5831571/

PS-NARRATIVE: 
19200110-19871002 RIV1-0.75 

The United States and Canada have engaged in relations that are characterized at the 0.75 level from at least August of 1940. In that year, the U.S. and Canada formed the Permanent Joint Board on Defence (PJBD). The PJBD is a `government level defense organization that provides a forum for policy level consultation on bilateral defense issues. It meets twice a year to discuss matters of mutual concern regarding the U.S./Canada region. It is at this point that relations between Canada and the United States are clearly at the level of 0.75 or positive peace. 

See the narrative above for a more complete description of relations in the years subsequent to this date. 

The relationship between the U.S. and Canada during this period has all the characteristics of relations at the 0.75 level. These include the basic idea that conflict is unthinkable. This is made evident by their joint military planning and cooperation in the PJBD, NORAD, and NATO. Further, as is widely reported, the pair share the worlds longest unguarded border which provides more evidence of the absence of the possibility of conflict between the two (Wikipedia, 2006)

During this time the pair expressed a low level integration efforts. They clearly integrated their security functions but a strong nationalist resistance in Canada to economic integration persisted until Brian Mulroney's tenure as Prime Minister and the resulting Canadian American Free Trade Act of 1988. 

19871003-20159999 RIV1-1.0

The relationship moves to the 1.0 level in 1987 with the signing of the Canadian American Free Trade Agreement on October 3, 1987. At first, there was great controversy over the agreement as Canadian Liberals worried about the loss of Canadian sovereignty. This, among other factors, lead to the Progressive Conservative defeat in the elections of 1993. However, the Liberals expanded this agreement in 1994 signing the North American Free Trade Agreement which included Mexico in the accord.
