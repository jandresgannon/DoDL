NARRATIVE-CM:
Bulgaria recognized the independence of Israel on November 26, 1948. Bulgarian military aircraft shot down an Israeli civilian aircraft over Bulgarian territory on July 27, 1955, resulting in the deaths of 58 individuals. Bulgarian expressed "deep regret" for the incident on July 29, 1955. On February 14, 1956, Israel requested $2.5 million in compensation for the deaths of 22 Israeli passengers killed in the shooting down of the Israeli civilian aircraft over Bulgarian territory. Bulgaria offered $58,000 in compensation to Israel on August 5, 1957, but Israel rejected the offer. Israel submitted the case to the *International Court of Justice *(ICJ) on October 17, 1957. Bulgarian announced that it was not subject to the jurisdiction of the ICJ on March 16, 1959. On March 26, 1959, the ICJ ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over the case involving the shooting down of an Israeli civilian aircraft over Bulgaria. Bulgaria agreed to pay $195,000 in compensation to Israel on June 2, 1963. Bulgaria severed diplomatic relations with Israel on June 10, 1967.
