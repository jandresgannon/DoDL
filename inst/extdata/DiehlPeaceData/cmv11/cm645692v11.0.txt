CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4273 from cm narrative, this MID involves Iraq's refusal to comply with UN weapons inspectors and enforcement of the no-fly zone. Iraq expelled weapons inspectors and repeatedly violated the no-fly zone. The US and UK repeatedly threatened Iraq and eventually bombed them over a four day period. Bahrain was part of a coalition of states that participated in a show of force to deter Iraq from further violations. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved violation and enforcement of the no-fly zone over Iraq. The no-fly zone was put in place to prevent Saddam Hussein from attacking militarized rebels in Kurdistan.

The dispute began (10/7/1997) because of increasing intransigence by Iraq. Iraq increased the frequency with which it violated the no-fly zones and threatened to refuse to allow Americans on the UN inspections team. Most importantly, Iraq threatened to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane. The United States and the United Kingdom responded by threatening military action if Iraq attempted to shoot down an American plane. Kuwait responded to the heightened tension between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq by putting its troops on alert. On 11/13/1997, Iraq carried out its threat to expel US Arms inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom began preparing for punitive air strikes against Iraq if Iraq did not begin to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. On 11/23/1997, Iraq allowed weapons inspectors to reenter, but it continued to hamper UN investigations, restricting access to selected sites. On 1/17/1998, Iraq again threatened to expel weapons inspectors, requesting that economic sanctions against it be lifted. The United States reiterated its threat to use force if Iraq did not allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected sites. The US and UK military buildup in the region continued and they announced that their forces were combat ready (2/7/1998). In MIDNovember, the United States reissued its threat to use force against Iraq if it did not unconditionally comply with UN weapons inspectors. All remaining weapons inspectors withdrew in response to the United States' warning. Iraq capitulated on 11/15/1998, promising to comply with the UN inspection teams. The United States and the United Kingdom stated that if Iraq did not continue to comply, they would use force against it. On 12/10, Iraq ended cooperation with UN inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would attack Iraq without warning for breaking it promise of full cooperation. On 11/16, they began "Operation Desert Fox," a four-day bombing campaign against Iraq. Israel also put its military on alert, fearing that Iraq would attack it in retaliation for U.S. and British military actions against Iraq. Almost immediately after the American and British bombing campaign, Iraq stated that it would challenge the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq (11/1998; 1/3/1999). There were clashes on almost a daily basis between British and American planes patrolling the northern and southern no-fly zones and Iraqi military installations from December 1998 to October 2001. Although clashes between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq occurred almost continuously until October, Iraqi challenges to the no-fly zones escalated in August 2001 and were more frequent until mid-October. On 2/15/1999, Iraq threatened to attack Turkey if it continued to allow American planes to use its bases. On 2/2/1999, the United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would retaliate if fired upon, by bombing pre-determined targets in Iraq that were deemed threatening. The United States and the United Kingdom engaged in numerous retaliatory bombing campaigns on Iraqi targets through October (2001), as Iraq continued to threaten and fire upon American and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones. On 10/22/1999, 11 nations (USA, UK, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Greece, and Germany) participated in joint military exercises to demonstrate that an anti-Iraq coalition could still be formed. On 5/23/2001 and 8/24/2001, an Iraqi patrol crossed into Saudi territory and fired on a Saudi border patrol. Iraq acted in order to demonstrate its disapproval of Saudi aid to the United States. On 6/11/2001, Saudi Arabia seized a unused pipeline from Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi violations of Saudi borders. First day of dispute was on 2/25/2003 and last day of dispute was on 3/18/2003.
Over the course of 2002, US and UK planes bombed various Iraqi defense systems placed either in or near the US-imposed no-fly zones. During this time Iraq deployed ground forces to its border towns in a preemptive move against future US aggression. Beginning in March 2003, the US began deploying additional land, naval, and air forces to the the Middle East in a clear show of force and build-up to a future invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, just prior to the US-led invasion, several Middle Eastern countries deployed small numbers of troops to Kuwait in a symbolic show of defense for the neighbor of Iraq, which had been the historical target of Iraqi aggression. Later in March 2003, a US-led coalition, seeking to oust the regime of Saddam Hussein and dismantle alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, invaded Iraq and engaged in major combat operations, ultimately resulting in war, against the country that lasted until May 1, 2003. First day of dispute was on 2/22/2003 and last day of dispute was on 3/18/2003.

As was the case on several occasions after the end of the Gulf War, Iraq sent troops and/or took other hostile actions directed at Kuwait. During this dispute, sources say Iraq moved 50,000 or more troops close to the Kuwaiti border. Iraqi actions provoked a number of responses from members of the Gulf War coalition both to reinforce the border, and to signal Iraq that its action would not be tolerated. Coder: Ric Stoll. Date: 8/2/02. First day of dispute was on 10/11/1994 and last day of dispute wa son 10/20/1994.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The rivalry between Iraq and Bahrain revolves primarily around the Persian Gulf War (MID3957) and its aftermath. However, MID2565, a one day dispute on August 26th 1986 seems to be an isolated dispute with no relation to MID3957 and MID4269. MID2565 involves Iraq's attempt to destroy Iran's oil resources during the course of the Iraq/Iran War. An oil tanker was sunk by Iraqi aircraft of the coast of Iran and air strikes were launched by Iraq and Iran on each other's oil facilities, one of them monitored by Bahrain, no fatalities reported (not much at all was written on this incident, so I cannot be 100% sure, nor was anything written on Bahrain's response).

MID3957 is the Persian Gulf War, started on August 2, 1990 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations Security Council immediately passed Resolution 660 condemning the invasion. The Arab League, on August 3rd, also called for Iraq's immediate withdrawal. Bahrain joined the Arab coalition against Iraq. Hostilities end on February 28th 1991 and the war was officially ended with the Security Council Resolution 686 on March 3rd 1991.

MID4269 involves Bahrain's commitment to defend Kuwait from Iraqi aggression. Concerned about troop build-ups along the Kuwaiti border by Iraqi forces, Bahrain, in October of 1994, sent air force planes and helicopters to join forces with the Gulf Cooperation Council and the international coalition to support the Kuwaiti army and to defend Kuwait. 

Overall, this rivalry does not seem to by a consistent one. MID3957 and MID4269 are clearly related to one another, but MID2565 seems to have nothing to do with the other two and appears to be an isolated incident involving the Iran-Iraq war.

Bahrain became independent on December 16, 1971. During the 1970s the Baath socialist media in Baghdad frequently denounced Manama as an enemy of Arab nationalism and a puppet of Washington's imperialism because it allowed United States naval vessels to use a naval base in Bahrain starting in 1973. The Bahraini government also believes that Baghdad has provided financial and other support to Bahraini opposition groups calling for the overthrow of the Al Khalifa dynasty.

The Prime Minister of Bahrain, Khalifah Bin Salman Al Khalifah, left Baghdad for Manama on October 11, 1979, concluding a short visit to Iraq of several hours. He and President Saddam Hussein discussed the situation in the Arab area, with particular emphasis on the Arab Gulf. During his visit, the Bahrain Prime Minister was accompanied by a delegation that included the Ministers of Interior and Information and the Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs. Khalifah noted that his talks dealt with issues of interest to the whole area, particularly to Iraq and Bahrain. In a press statement prior to his departure, the Bahrain Prime Minister said that Iraq and Bahrain were agreed in their views on Gulf issues. He said: Our concept of Gulf security is not restricted to the protection of shipping in the Gulf and the Gulf's waterways. It also includes the protection of the Gulf states against foreign tampering with its security and stability through intervention, whatever the source of such foreign intervention or methods used. He said that the Arab homeland's circumstances and the challenges facing it are the reason for the quick action by officials in the area in consulting and exchanging views on all issues under discussion. Khalifah Bin Salman Al Khalifah said that the Iraqi RCC member and Defense Minister, Adnan Khayrallah's, visit to Bahrain "was effective in defining views on the dangers facing the Arab homeland, particularly the Arab Gulf region". He said that these dangers were nurtured and posed by several foreign quarters in an effort to place the area in a state of chaos and to undermine its security and stability. He noted that he had conveyed a message from the Amir of Bahrain, Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifah, to President Saddam Hussein. The Bahrain Prime Minister said that Iraq's sincere response had had an effective influence on achieving the good results of his visit and in strengthening co-operation between Iraq and Bahrain.

On September 5, 1980, Bahrain's Prime Minister, Shaykh Khalifah Bin Salman Al Khalifah has stated that his talks with President Saddam Hussein were conducted in a fraternal atmosphere reflecting solidarity between the two countries. He reiterated Bahrain's full support for Iraq's pan-Arab stands under President Saddam Hussein in the service of the Arab nation. He also referred to the strong fraternal relations between President Saddam Hussein and Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifah, the Amir of Bahrain. The Prime Minister of Bahrain said that his visit to Iraq sought to strengthen the relations of solidarity between the Arab people in the two countries. He added that he looked forward to more meetings between officials of the two countries at all levels in order to strengthen further the fraternal ties between them. He expressed Bahrain's support for the Iraqi-Saudi decision to boycott states that maintain embassies in the Holy City of Jerusalem.

MID2565, a one day dispute on August 26th 1986 seems to be an isolated dispute with no relation to MID3957 and MID4269. MID2565 involves Iraq's attempt to destroy Iran's oil resources during the course of the Iraq/Iran War. An oil tanker was sunk by Iraqi aircraft of the coast of Iran and air strikes were launched by Iraq and Iran on each other's oil facilities, one of them monitored by Bahrain, no fatalities reported (not much at all was written on this incident, so I cannot be 100% sure, nor was anything written on Bahrain's response).

On December 16, 1986, the Amir of Bahrain appealed for an end to the Iran-Iraq war in his national speech marking Bahrain's Independence Day. Speaking on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the country's independence from Britain and the silver jubilee of his accession to the throne, Amir Sheik Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa urged the Iranian government to respond to Iraq's peace overtures. He warned that to disrupt free navigation in the gulf might plunge the whole gulf region into strife. He pledged that Bahrain, together with five other countries of the gulf cooperation council (GCC)-Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman-fully supports an end to the Iran-Iraq war.

Bahrain and Iraq concluded on December 12, 1989, an agreement on non-interference in each other's internal affairs and non-use of force against each other, the Kuwait news agency reported from Manama, capital of Bahrain. The accord was signed by Bahrain's prime minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa and the deputy chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council Izzat Ibrahim currently visiting Manama. Following the signing ceremony, Sheikh Khalifa said that this agreement represents part of the efforts to enhance rapprochement between Arab states in all fields. Bahrain is the second gulf cooperation council member state to sign with Iraq such an agreement, preceded by Saudi Arabia which concluded a friendship agreement with Iraq on March 27, 1989.

On April 8, 1990, Bahrain said Iraq has the legitimate right to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, the gulf news agency reported. In a statement issued in Manama, capital of Bahrain, the Bahraini cabinet said Bahrain supports Iraq in its fight against the organized anti-Iraqi media campaign. The statement described the campaign as intended to create a pretext for aggression on Iraq with the aim of barring Iraq's scientific achievements and obstructing efforts currently made for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian issue. The statement voiced Bahrain's appreciation for Iraq's attitudes calling for peace and stability in the Middle East and Iraq's readiness to destroy its stock of chemical weapons under a regional agreement that will compel Israel to abandon destructive weapons and sign a nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Bahrain was one of the first Arab countries to come out to express support for Iraq when Iraqi president Saddam Hussein turned down international appeals for clemency for the London-based journalist Farzead Bazoft. Saddam was the object of harsh criticism by western countries when Bazoft was hanged as a "spy" Saddam also faced allegations that Iraq tried to smuggle nuclear bomb trigger devices. Saddam charged that the campaign is a big power conspiracy in preparation for Israel's attack against Iraq and threatened to use chemical weapons against Israel if attacked. Iraqi first deputy prime minister Taha Yassin Ramadan reaffirmed in Tunis his country's readiness to destroy its stock of chemical weapons on condition that Israel demolishes its nuclear arsenal.

19941113-20000330 Transition

On November 13, 1994, Bahrain welcomed Iraq's recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence as "a positive step in the right direction" towards implementation by Baghdad of all United Nations Security Council resolutions on the 1991 Gulf war. The cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa Bin Sulman Al Khalifa, stressed that the Iraqi move would pave the way for consolidating and boosting security and stability in this vital region, the Manama-based Gulf News Agency (GNA) reported. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also welcomed the move. Iraq previously dropped its long-standing claim to Kuwait as its 19th province in a statement signed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as the chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council. Iraq's parliament also ratified a decision recognizing Kuwait's sovereignty and borders.

On October 3, 1995, Shaikh Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa of Bahrain underlined Bahrain's firm stance towards Iraq's national unity, territorial integrity and security. He made his remarks during talks with head of the UN's special commission on Iraq, Rolf Ekeus. The Amir stressed the importance of Iraq's commitment to all UN resolutions concerning Kuwait, so that the suffering of the people of Iraq could be alleviated. He also pledged Bahrain's support for activities of the UN commission on Iraqi disarmament. Mr Ekeus briefed the Amir on the commission's activities and the outcome of his recent meeting with Iraqi officials. He also extended the thanks of the UN and the special commission to the Amir and Bahrain for the facilities provided to ensure the success of the Bahrain-based commission's activities. Present were Housing, Municipalities and Environment Minister and acting Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa and foreign undersecretary Ghazi Al Gosaibi.

A Bahraini business delegation led by a member of the Gulf state's ruling family was in Iraq on November 14, 1996, to discuss trade opportunities expected to arise once Baghdad's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations comes about. The four-man team, led by Sheik Salman bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, already met Iraq's finance and health ministers, but no details of their discussions were disclosed. It is the first visit by businessmen from Bahrain since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Bahrain was a member of a U.S.-led coalition force which threw Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War. In Bahrain, Iraq's Charge D'affaires Ahmed Tayes Abdullah told The Associated Press that the visit was purely private and that it had nothing to do with the government of the island nation. Under the oil-for-food deal signed in May 1995, Iraq would be allowed to sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and medicine. The deal has been delayed for months by wrangling between Iraq and the United States over the conditions. The food and medicine are desperately needed six years after the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq for invading Kuwait. The sanctions banned Iraq's vital oil exports and froze its overseas assets. Bahrain and Kuwait are partners in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, an economic and political alliance which also includes Saudi Arabia, United Arab emirates, Oman and Qatar. Kuwait still opposes any reconciliation between Iraq and its Gulf allies. There has been no comment from Kuwait's government on the Bahraini visit to Iraq, but Kuwaiti newspapers gave prominent display to the trip.

Iraq's state-owned Rafidain bank will resume activities at its branch in Bahrain after a closure of six years since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, official sources said on February 4, 1997. The Bahraini branch of Iraq's largest bank has been under the supervision of the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA), which acts as the Gulf archipelago's central bank, since it was closed on August 21, 1990. But the official newspaper Al-Qadissiya said the "BMA announced the branch returned under Iraq's direction" in an official report published in Manama on December 25, 1996. "The branch will resume its regular activities after a new Iraqi director is appointed. This person has effectively assumed his duties," Dhia Habib al-Khayoun, Rafidain's managing director, told the daily. Iraq's charge d'affaires in Manama, Ahmad al-Tayesh, told AFP when contacted from Dubai that the Rafidain branch would also recover assets seized in 1990. "The branch was placed under BMA's direction after Gulf International Bank (based in Manama) in 1990 seized the branch's deposits which were estimated at more than 2.5 million dollars," Tayesh said. The new director is now in place with five employees, the diplomat added. "These deposits were recovered by the branch, which amounts to an important step toward resuming its activities," he said. Iraq's overseas assets were frozen under a UN Security Council resolution that followed Iraq's August 2, 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Baghdad estimated that 1.5 billion dollars in assets were frozen in Arab countries. Bahrain joined the US-led forces which drove Iraqi occupation troops from Kuwait in February 1991. Although Iraq has diplomats based in Manama, the Bahraini embassy in Baghdad remains closed.

Bahrain announced on February 17, 1998, that it is not allowing the use of its territory for any military action against Iraq, according to a statement from the Bahraini Ministry of Information obtained by the German Press Agency. In Washington, however, U.S. officials could not immediately confirm or deny the report. "The Bahraini Minister of Information Mohammed Ibrahim Al Mutawaa stated that in the light of Baharain's conviction of the need to reach a diplomatic solution to the current crisis between Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), it has not allowed the use of its territory for any military action against Iraq," said the statement. The minister affirmed that Bahrain believes that it is necessary to redouble the political efforts and give diplomatic activity its full opportunity to reach a peaceful solution based on the respect for, and implementation of Security Council resolutions and safeguarding the region from the grave consequences, said the statement.

On December 4, 1999, visas were being issued to individuals wishing to travel to Iraq on the inaugural voyage of a new direct sea link between Bahrain and Iraq. The passenger-cum-cargo service between Bahrain and Umm Qasr, which is expected to be launched on December 23, 1999, is the first since the Gulf War. The service to sanctions-bound Iraq has been made possible after a United Nations committee on Iraq approved earlier the resumption of cargo movement and travel by private citizens from Bahrain to Iraq, by sea.

On April 1, 2000, it was announced that Bahrain plans to reopen its embassy in Iraq, a decade after it shut down following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Hassan al-Ansari, an advisor at the Gulf island nation's Foreign Ministry, traveled to Iraq in March 2000 to take necessary steps for reopening the embassy, the agency said, citing an unidentified Foreign Ministry official. The reopening was initiated for ''humane reasons for the interest of Bahrain citizens who visit Iraq's holy sites,'' the official was quoted as saying without elaborating on when the embassy would be opened, at what level or who would represent Bahrain. Iraq's charge d'affaires to Bahrain, Awadh Fakhri, confirmed the plans, telling The Associated Press that Bahrain would be represented at the level of charge d'affaires, which is lower representation than keeping an ambassador in a country. ''I am very happy with the news,'' said Fakhri, adding that he expected the embassy would open within a month. ''We hope this will further improve relations between the two countries.'' Before the 1990 invasion, Iraq and Bahrain had ambassadors in each other's capitals. After, Iraq maintained a presence in Bahrain, but reduced it to charge d'affaires. Gulf states severed their diplomatic ties with Iraq after its invasion of their fellow Gulf Cooperation Council member. The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Bahrain's move will not, however, alter its position that Iraq must comply with all U.N. resolutions as well as issues raised by the Arab League and GCC states, the agency quoted the Bahraini official as saying. In December 1999, passengers from Bahrain began traveling to Iraq aboard a U.N.-permitted ferry service from the Gulf to the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. The route opened the first sea link between Iraq and Bahrain since the United Nations imposed travel and trade sanctions on Iraq for invading Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War. About 600 Bahrainis travel each month to Iraq, which is home to some of the holiest Shiite Muslims shrines. Shiites comprise a slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens. Qatar and Oman are the only two GCC countries with embassies in Iraq.

Iraq's foreign minister on January 16, 2002, ended the highest-level visit of an Iraqi official to Bahrain since the 1991 Gulf war, a trip that a Bahraini official said was aimed at enlisting help in mending ties with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Bahraini leaders agreed to convey Naji Sabri al-Hadithi's message of Iraq's desire to repair relations, the Bahraini official said on condition of anonymity. However, the official said Bahraini leaders told al-Hadithi told that Bahrain expects Iraq to comply with all U.N. resolutions relating to requirements for lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq's1990 invasion of Kuwait. Among the most contentious of those requirements is full Iraqi cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Al-Hadithi made no comments to journalists while in Bahrain. Gulf nations severed or severely curtailed diplomatic ties with Iraq after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Bahrain reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2000, but at the charge d'affairs level-a step beneath sending an ambassador. Iraq reduced its representation in Bahrain from ambassador to charge d'affairs after the 1990 invasion. As relations slowly have improved in recent years, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates have reopened their embassies in Iraq. Relations with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, however, remain frigid.

On March 21, 2002, Iraqi authorities have welcomed moves to enhance trade and economic cooperation with Bahrain. They are eager to sign a free trade agreement with Bahrain, besides establishing direct sea and air links between the two countries. A cooperation agreement has been signed between the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which organized a trade visit to Baghdad, and the Union of Iraqi Chambers of Commerce. The 44-member Bahraini business delegation, which returned on 19 March, 2002, from Baghdad, was led by the chamber President. The visit coincided with the Exhibition for Rebuilding Infrastructure of Iraq, which was held in Baghdad from 17-21 March, 2002, and was the first official trade delegation to visit Iraq from Bahrain in at least 12 years. The Bahraini delegation was received by a number of Iraqi ministers, including Commerce Minister Dr Muhammad Mahdi Salih. "The Iraqi side is keen to sign a free trade agreement with Bahrain, as this will be a big boost to bilateral trade," said Mr Kanu. Dr Salih said duty free access could be given immediately to a number of products from Bahrain, including industrial chemicals, soaps and cleaning detergents and plastics. The delegation was also received by Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yasin Ramadan, who encouraged the Bahraini private sector to take advantage of the huge requirements of Iraq. Iraqi Transportation Minister Ahmad Murtada Ahmad urged the Bahraini delegation to establish joint venture private companies which would operate a direct sea and air line between the two countries. "The Iraqi side also asked us to hold a Made in Bahrain exhibition in Baghdad," said Mr Kanu. The Iraqi Union of Industrial Chamber s of Commerce also presented a number of investment opportunities that Bahraini investors could take part in with Iraqi partners. "It was a very good and enlightening visit," said Mr Kanu. "We wanted to see how we can re-establish trade with Iraq and, in that direction, the visit was very informative." Bahrain-Iraq trade is currently worth 6m US dollars (2.68m Bahraini dinars a year. In comparison, UAE-Iraq trade is in excess of 3bn dollars (1.1bn dinars) and Saudi Arabia-Iraq trade is about 1bn dollars (378m dinars).

On March 20, 2003, US invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein's regime. The US naval base in Bahrain played a major role in the invasion of Iraq. The relations between Iraq and Bahrain improved in the aftermath of that invasion. On April 15, 2003, it was announced that the agreements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the Kingdom of Bahrains private sector with the Iraqi government or private sector are still valid. Leading businessmen and legislators told the Tribune in an interview that Bahrain and Iraqs private sectors have had very close ties and good working relationship spanning over the decades. These cordial bilateral ties were based on mutual understanding, respect and religious harmony among the people of both Arab brethren countries. Othman Mohammed Sharif, Chairman of the Bahrain-Asian Traders Committee (BATC) at the Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) and a member of the Chamber of Deputies said that Bahrain has a very crucial role in the re-building and re-construction of Iraq in post-Saddam era. The agreements signed by Bahrain with the Iraqi regime are still valid according to the spirit of the international law and the UN charter, Sharif said. The new regime in Iraq will have to start restructuring from the scratch and I hope that the new government will take into consideration the previously signed MoUs and agreements. Sharif added that the international community expects from a new Iraqi regime to take into account all its obligations under the international law. Replying to a question Sharif said that there was no cogent reason before the future Iraqi regime to scrap the previous agreements and the MoUs signed by both public and private sectors.

Bahrain has raised its diplomatic representation in Baghdad to the ambassadorial level, a foreign ministry official was quoted as saying on June 30, 2004. "The foreign affairs minister has addressed a memorandum to his Iraqi counterpart" about the decision, the ministry's undersecretary, Yussef Mohammed Mahmud, told the state news agency BNA. Diplomatic relations between Iraq and Bahrain were never broken off. An Iraqi charge d'affaires continued to work in Manama despite the war launched last April to oust Saddam Hussein and the subsequent US-led occupation. Bahrain reopened its embassy in Baghdad, which had been closed since 1990, in April 2000 at the charge d'affaires level. The decision by Manama, a key US ally in the region, comes after Washington handed back sovereignty to Iraqi officials on June 28, 2004.

Bahrain's king said on July 3, 2004, that his tiny Gulf kingdom is ready to send a naval force to help safeguard Iraqi territorial waters, if asked by the new Iraqi government, the official BahrainNews Agency reported. The announcement by Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa made Bahrain the second close U.S. ally in the Arab world, after Jordan, to offer troops to Iraq without precondition. "Bahrain is ready to resume its contributions with naval forces to help secure the Iraqi waters and also train the Iraqi forces in this field if the new Iraqi government asked for it," Sheik Hamad announced while visiting the general-directorate of the Bahrain Defense Force. Bahrain is home to the U.S. 5th Fleet. Earlier, Jordan's King Abdullah II said his country might become the first Arab state to send troops to Iraq, if Baghdad's government asked for help. Yemen also said it would send peacekeeping forces, but only as part of a U.N.-controlled force and not until U.S.-led coalition forces have left the country.

Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi arrived in Bahrain on August 2, 2004, on the latest stop of a regional tour aimed at normalizing relations with Iraq's fellow Arab states, officials here told AFP. The Iraqi premier arrived from Kuwait, to which he paid a three-day visit which coincided with the 14th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of the emirate. His visit to Bahrain was previously unannounced. Bahrain was "among the first countries which supported Iraq and the Iraqi people and it is still giving a lot to Iraq," Iraqi Ambassador Ghassan Mohsen told AFP. "There is the prospect for bilateral cooperation and rebuilding Iraq, and Bahrain is participating in this," said Mohsen. He said Manama was already training Iraqi bankers, judges, civil defense forces, and that it was willing to train Iraqi marines. The Gulf state is also organising economic forums for Iraqi businessmen. Allawi's visit will focus on "enhancing this cooperation, and the Iraqi leadership appreciates Bahrain's stance," said Mohsen. Bahraini newspapers carried a statement on Monday underlining Manama's support for the Iraqi people and saying Bahrain looked forward to Iraq restoring security, stability and national unity. Bahrain's King Hamad said last month his country was ready to participate in a naval force to secure Iraq's territorial waters should Baghdad request its help. Allawi is leading a large delegation including Iraq's interim planning and oil ministers and its central bank governor.

Bahrain's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shaikh Mohammed bin Mubarak Al Khalifa affirmed on November 23, 2004, the initiative presented by HM King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to host an Iraqi National Conference in Bahrain, with the participation of all Iraqi trends and political groups, to ensure success in the upcoming elections. The initiative was welcomed by British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Jack Straw, and a number of participating countries. This came in a speech delivered by Shaikh Mohammed to the Sharm al Sheikh International Conference, which began on Tuesday morning with the participation of Iraq's neighboring states, G8 countries, China, Bahrain, the United Nations, the Arab League, the Islamic Countries Organization and the Non Allied Countries, for consultations on the situation in Iraq.

Bahrain's ambassador to Iraq, who was wounded in an assassination attempt in Baghdad in early July 2005, is in "excellent" health and is receiving medical treatment in Amman, a hospital official said. Hassan Malallah al-Ansari was "shot in the arm ... but he has no difficulty moving it now," said Dr. Jamal Haddad, the director general of Al-Hussein Medical City in Amman. Al-Ansari was attacked in western Baghdad on July 5 by would-be assassins and treated at a U.S. military hospital in Iraq before being sent to neighboring Jordan. The attack occurred three days after gunmen kidnapped Egypt's top envoy to Iraq, Ihab al-Sherif, who was later reportedly killed by the al-Qaida in Iraq terror group. No photographic evidence has surfaced proving his death. Pakistani ambassador Mohammed Younis Khan also left Baghdad last week after his convoy was attacked in a kidnap attempt. Bahrain, a close American ally and home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, played a support role during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.

Bahrain's Prime Minister, Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, received in Manama on August 7, 2005, Iraqi Vice President, Shaikh Ghazi Al Yawer, currently visiting Bahrain.

The Prime Minister reiterated Bahrain's firm stance towards Iraq's stability and territorial integrity, wishing Iraq every prosperity and safety to resume its role in the joint Arab cooperation. The meeting also touched on issues of common concern and the developments in the Middle East and Iraq.
