CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to fight with the rebels against the government, and Zaire suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba for doing so in April 1977. From Washington Post 4/11/1977, France announced that it was providing planes for Morocco to fly war supplies to help Zaire's government fight against the rebels. Morocco also provided troops to fight against the rebels directly. Cuba and Morocco's opposing support in the Zaire civil war pull them into this MID against each other. Coded civil war link because this MID is connected to the Zaire civil war, outside of this dyad.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2969 from the Globe and Mail 7/15/1980, Morocco broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in April 1980 after Cuba recognized the Polisario Front as the government of Western Sahara, a piece of disputed territory that Morocco was partially administrating. (Algeria also claimed Western Sahara and was packing the Polisario Front.) In July 1980, Morocco shot at two Cuban ships in waters near Western Sahara, killing one. Cuba condemned the attack. Coded third party link to territory because this MID was connected to Cuba recognizing the Algeria-backed rebel group claiming Western Sahara, which was disputed by Algeria and Morocco.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2969 this MID also involved a rebel group, the Polisario Front, fighting in and claiming the territory of Western Sahara. Cuba recognized the Polisario Front as the government of Western Sahara, triggering this MID as Morocco responded by breaking off diplomatic relations with Cuba and attacking two of their ships near Western Sahara. Coded civil war link because this involved civil conflict being waged between Morocco and a militarized rebel group fighting in Western Sahara, outside of this dyad.
