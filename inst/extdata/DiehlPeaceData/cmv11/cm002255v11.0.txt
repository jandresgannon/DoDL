MARITMID-NOTES: MID254 from cm002200v11.0 narrative, British and German ships blockaded several Venezuelan ports when Venezuela defaulted on its debt to those countries in 1902-1903. Roosevelt claimed he sent US ships into the area to deter the ships from taking further action, triggering this MID. Coded not maritime because even if it did occur, it did not involve a disputed maritime boundary and no one was advancing a maritime claim here. 

Coded uncertain because it’s not clear that a MID occurred. From cm002200v11.0 file: "Theodore Roosevelt claimed during the 1916 election campaign that he had ordered U.S. ships into the area to force German cooperation. Livermore (1946) reviews the documentary evidence, finds little corroboration for Roosevelt's claim and concludes that Roosevelt probably concocted the story for political reasons. DeConde (1963, 385), Langley (1985, 25-6) also doubt about that naval action actually took place."
