TERRMID: MID1780 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1780 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1780 from Gibler 2018, after WWI, the territory of Fiume was still disputed. In August 1923, Mussolini told Yugoslavia that if they did not come to an agreement on the territory, he would take action. Yugoslavia agreed to cede the land, but when Italy perceived that Yugoslavia was delaying in vacating it, they amassed troops on the border. Italy eventually took control of the territory after Yugoslavia's acquiescence. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the disputed territory of Fiume.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID1780 from Gibler 2018, part of the Fiume dispute involved Porto Barros, a port in the territory of Fiume, which both sides claimed. Porto Barros was one of the reasons the sides could not come to an agreement. Coded maritime MID because this involved a dispute over a port, which carries potential maritime boundary implications.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3362 from Gibler 2018, on 3/22/1926, Italian customs officers crossed into Serbia and entered a Serbian inn. When Yugoslavian officers demanded they leave, a shootout ensued. Coded not territory because they were not disputing territory here. This seemed to be a random fight between low-level soldiers/bureaucrats of each country.

TERRMID: MID1062 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1062 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1062 from Gibler 2018, after WWII, the area of Trieste was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia and contained ethnic Italians and Slovenes. (From cm narrative, this territory was disputed.) Each country was concerned with the treatment of their respective ethnic kin, and each amassed troops on the border due to tensions over treatment of their ethnic kin. Tensions eventually subsided. Coded territorial MID because this MID was connected to tensions over the disputed terrtory of Trieste.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID3224 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, Yugoslavia seized 22 Italian fishing boats in its territorial waters. Yugoslavia did not protest. Coded not maritime because per New York Times 6/14/1954, this was connected to Italy suspecting the boats being used for smuggling and was not connected to the dispute over Trieste. Coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped, as Italy did not protest.

TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID3551 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Yugoslavia thought the Yugoslav substates should not have their own boundaries independent of Yugoslavia. They therefore refused to recognize the independence of states that declared independence from Yugoslavia, still claiming their territory as part of Yugoslavia. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Italy (as part of UN/NATO) became involved in this MID, which is territorial (with other dyads), civil war, and civil war link.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/independence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerrillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia armed the villagers. The newly armed villagers then violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia.

Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of protecting the ethnic Serbs there.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 6/11/1998 and last day of dispute was on 6/10/1999.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat.

NARRATIVE-CM: On November 3, 1918, Italian troops occupied the territory of Trieste following the collapse of the Austria-Hungarian Empire during the *First World War*. Italy and Yugoslavia disputed the sovereignty of the town of Fiume (Rijeka) and the Dalmatian coast on the Adriatic Sea beginning in February 1919. President Woodrow Wilson of the United States rejected Italy's claim to Fiume during the Paris Peace Conference on April 14, 1919 (resulting in a boycott of the peace conference by Italy between April 24 and May 5, 1919). Italian nationalists led by Gabriele d'Annunzio took control of Fiume on September 12, 1919. Italian troops took control of Fiume on December 27, 1919. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Treaty of Rapallo* on November 12, 1920, which provided for the independence of Fiume and the Italian renunciation of its claim to the Dalmatian coast. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Treaty of Santa Margherita* on October 23, 1922, which reaffirmed the *Treaty of Rapallo*. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed a five-year treaty of friendship on January 27, 1924, and Yugoslavia agreed to recognize Italian sovereignty over Fiume. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed non-aggression pact on March 25, 1937. Yugoslavia agreed to join the *Tripartite Pact* (Gremany, Italy, Japan) on March 25, 1941. Axis troops, including Italian troops, invaded Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941, and Axis troops captured Belgrade on April 12, 1941. Yugoslavia surrendered to Axis troops on April 17, 1941. Some 17,000 Yugoslav civilians were killed during the invasion. Marshall Josip Tito, communist leader of Yugoslavia, claimed the Istria region, including the city of Trieste, on April 15, 1945. Italy immediately rejected Yugoslavia's claim to the territory. Yugoslav troops occupied parts of the Istria region on May 1, 1945, and Allied troops entered the region on May 2, 1945. On May 14, 1945, the United States expressed opposition to the occupation of parts of the Istria region by Yugoslav troops. On May 19, 1945, Yugoslavia rejected an Allied (US and Britain) demand that it turn over control of Trieste to Allied troops. Allied and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Belgrade Agreement* on June 9, 1945, which provided for the division of the Istria region into two zones-Zone A (northern Istria, including Trieste) under temporary Allied administration and Zone B (southern Istria) under Yugoslav administration. Yugoslavia withdrew its troops from Zone A on June 11, 1945. The *Allied Council of Foreign Ministers* (ACFM) established the Free Territory of Trieste on July 12, 1946. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed a peace treaty in Paris on February 10, 1947, which provided for Yugoslav control of the Dalmatian coast and most of the Istria region. The US, Britain, and France issued the *Tripartite Declaration* on March 20, 1948, which recommended that the entire territory of Trieste should be returned to Italian sovereignty. The Soviet Union announced its opposition to the proposal on April 13, 1948. Italy referred a dispute concerning the delimitation of the border with Yugoslavia to the Allied ambassadors in Rome on May 20, 1948. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed to resume delimitation of their border on August 16, 1948. Municipal elections were held on June 12, 1949, and two-thirds of the seats in the 60-member municipal council were won by Italian parties. Britain and the US announced on October 8, 1953 that they would withdraw their troops from Trieste and turn Zone A over to the Italians. Yugoslavia protested the decision and threatened to send troops into Zone A if Italy attempted to occupy the zone. Both Italy and Yugoslavia sent additional troops to the dispute region. On October 18, 1953, the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France proposed a conference with Italy and Yugoslavia to discuss the dispute. Six individuals were killed in riots in Trieste on November 4, 1953. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on November 21, 1953 to attend the conference. Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on December 5, 1953 to withdraw their troops from the border, and the troops were withdrawn on December 20, 1953.

British and US representatives facilitated negotiations between Italian and Yugoslav representatives in London beginning on February 2, 1954. Italy and Yugoslavia signed an agreement in London on October 5, 1954, which gave provisional control of Zone A to Italy and Zone B to Yugoslavia. Allied administration of Zone A was formally terminated on October 26, 1954. Italian and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Treaty of Osimo* on November 10, 1975, which formalized the 1954 settlement of the territorial dispute.

NARRATIVE-CR:

RIV838 is a series of disputes over different territorial disagreements. The first disagreements follow territorial disagreements arising out of the aftermath of World War I. MID1780 occurred from August 23, 1923 to September 24, 1923. This is a MID linked to the status of Trieste. Mussolini massed troops around the city of Trieste and at the border with Yugoslavia in a show of force against Italy's neighbor and Yugoslavia's requests for Trieste. MID3362 occurred on March 22, 1926. No information could be found on this MID.

The second set of disputes stem from territorial disagreements that arise at the end of World War II. MID258 occurred from March 25, 1939 to August 14, 1945. This is World War II in which Italy and Yugoslavia were engaged on different sides. MID3814 occurred from October 10, 1940 to December 1940 and involved only Yugoslavia and Italy. This MID is about several attacks by Italian destroyers on Yugoslavian cities, including on the city of Monastir on November 5, 1940.

Axis powers, including Italy, invade Yugoslavia in 1941, with Belgrade surrendering in April of that year. Toward the end of the war, Marshall Tito, the communist leader of Yugoslavia, claims the Istria region, including the town of Trieste. Istria fell under control of Italy at the end of World War I, with the disintegration of the Austria-Hungary empire. Yugoslavia occupied the territory in 1945, with Italy and the Allied forces immediately protesting the move. Allied troops moved to occupy Istria in 1945 and in June of that year, the Allied forces and Yugoslavia signed the Belgrade Agreement; this divided the region into to administrative zones, with one governed by Yugoslavia and the other by Allied forces. Allied forces attempted to turn over their zone to Italian forces in 1953 but Yugoslavia protested. An attempt by Italy to occupy the zone caused a crisis, as both states sent reinforcements to the region (MID1062). MID1062 occurred from August 28, 1953 to December 20, 1953. A conference was held later that year, and both states subsequently agreed to withdraw troops from the respective borders. MID3205 occurred from May 21 to May 22, 1954. Yugoslavia filed a protest with Italy over the seizure of four Yugoslav soldiers by an Italian gunboat on May 21. The four soldiers were released on May 22, 1954. In October 1954, Italy and Yugoslavia signed an agreement that gave the two states control over the respective regions. The last militarized dispute over the region was MID3224 on April 11, 1956. The agreement signed in 1954 effectively ends the disagreement and, after the final dispute in 1956, the rivalry comes to an end.

After 1956, the two states do not experience any more militarized disputes until the breakup of Yugoslavia following the end of the Cold War. The agreement signed in 1954 to settle the dispute over the Istria region is formalized through the Treaty of Osima signed in 1975; the treaty formally comes into effect two years later, in 1977. Prior to the formal treaty, the two countries had limited contact. Any contact that did occur, the two countries were careful to not discuss the Istria region, with both parties maintaining position in support of the status quo. Tension did flare briefly in 1974 when Yugoslavia erected markers along the border that appeared to mark a permanent division of the territory. This act upset the Italian government, which always viewed the agreement in 1954 as a temporary division for administrative purposes and that legally the territory belonged to Italy. The incident was minor and the official treaty was signed the following year.

After the treaty came into effect in 1977, the two countries had a series of diplomatic exchanges in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These meetings were official efforts at promoting detente and increasing the level of cooperation between the two states. This included cooperation over the border region, increased trade, and efforts to control pollution in the Adriatic. Relations remain largely unchanged through this period until the violence associated with the breakup of Yugoslavia begins in 1992. During the period from 1956 to 1992, relations can best be described as 0.5.

MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. By 1990 Yugoslavia was plagued with many problems before its breakup. Foreign debt, inflation, and unemployment created a troublesome atmosphere. More important were the strong nationalist feelings and political problems that lead to the crisis in Yugoslavia. In March and April of 1990 Slovenia and Croatia held their first multi-party elections in almost 50 years. The Communist reformers lost to parties favoring national sovereignty within Yugoslavia. Later in the year similar parties won election in Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and President Gligorov of Macedonia were looking for a democratic way to keep Yugoslavia a decentralized and reorganized union of states. President Izetbegovic and President Gligorov were concerned about Slovenia and Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because they would be left with only President Milosevic of Serbia. Milosevic rejected ideas for a looser federation of Yugoslav states.

MID4137 occurred from February of 1998 until June of 1999. This is the conflict in Kosovo. After years of rising tensions, in March of 1998, fighting erupts in Kosovo between the majority Albanians and Serbs and within months some 350,000 people have been displaced or fled abroad. In October, 1998, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and partial pull-out of Yugoslav forces and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe sent the first of 2,000 `verifiers' to monitor the agreement. In February, 1999, talks were held in Rambouillet, France, but discussions broke down and tensions and repressions rise again in Kosovo. In March, 1999, after repeated warnings, NATO launched its 78-day air war. Within three days, ethnic Albanians began to arrive in neighboring Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in huge numbers, walking, on tractor-trailers and by car. Authorities expel thousands of persons by special `refugee trains' to Macedonia, virtually emptying all major towns, such as Pristina, of Albanians. From April-May 1999, International agencies, governments and a special humanitarian task force from NATO called AFOR begin to construct dozens of camps for refugees in anticipation they will spend many months in exile. Some 444,600 refugees flee to Albania, 244,500 to Macedonia and 69,900 to Montenegro. Because of political pressures on the Macedonian government, more than 90,000 Albanians are airlifted to 29 countries for temporary safety. On June 3, 1999, Yugoslavia accepted a peace plan requiring withdrawal of all forces from Kosovo and the entry of peacekeepers under a U.N. mandate. On June 12, 1999, Russian and NATO forces entered Kosovo.

MID4186 and MID4343 occur in the aftermath of the conflict in Kosovo and are related to the withdrawal of forces from Kosovo and the lingering hostility between NATO forces and Serbia as Milosovic tried to hold on to power in his last few months in office.

RIV839 is effectively over with the end of the Kosovo war and the removal of Milosevic from power. MID4343, on November 28, 2000, marks the last dispute of this rivalry. On April 1, 2001, Milosevic was arrested on charges of abuse of power and corruption. On June 28 he was extradited to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. His trial on charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia and Kosovo began at The Hague on February 12, 2002. On April 11, the Yugoslav parliament passed a law allowing extradition of all persons charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. In March 2002, the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to dissolve FRY in favor of a new, much weaker form of cooperation called "Serbia and Montenegro". By order of Yugoslav Federal Parliament on February 4, 2003, Yugoslavia ceased to exist.

In December 2000, Italy makes an official statement, in conjunction with Yugoslavian President Kostunica, declaring Italian support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia interpreted this statement as a rejection by Italy of an independent Kosovo.

In January 2002, Italy and Yugoslavia declare that they share a similar view of European integration, with a focus on peace and stability in the region. Italy also donates 13 million Euros to Yugoslavia, for the purpose of aiding economic and social recovery.

In April 2003, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini declared Italy's full support to Serbia-Montenegro's integration into the European system and stabilization of relations with the European Union.

In March 2004, Italy opens a new general consulate to Serbia-Montenegro in the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica.

Great effort has been made by Serbia and Italy, in the aftermath of the Kosovo War, to normalize relations and increase cooperation. Italy, since 2005, has been the strongest supporter of moving Serbia quickly toward EU membership. This is true despite the official EU policy aimed at taking more patient approach until it is clear that Serbia has fully cooperated and will fully cooperate with the war crimes tribunal at the Hague. 

In February 2005, Italy declares full support for Serbia's EU membership. Italy also becomes one of the largest investors in Serbia's economy. In February 2005, Italy announces full support of Serbia-Montenegro's efforts to join EU by 2012.

In October 2005, Italy and Serbia discuss plans to dramatically increase trade.

In July 2006, Italy eases visa restriction, allowing for greater ease of travel to Italy for Serbian citizens. From the end of the Kosovo war until 2006, the relationship between Italy and Serbia can best be described as 0.5.
