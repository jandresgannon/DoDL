CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1430 from Gibler 2018, a Mozambique soldier killed a Rhodesian citizen, and Rhodesia responded by killing a Mozambique soldier. Tensions between the countries escalated. Around the same time, Zambia perceived that rebels in Rhodesia were about to launch an attack on Zambia, so Zambia declared war on Rhodesia. The tensions between Mozambique and Rhodesia escalated in this environment of Rhodesia-Zambia conflict, and Rhodesia bombed a Mozambique army post. Rhodesia conducted a raid in Mozambique territory as well. Around the same time, Zambia perceived that rebels in Rhodesia were about to launch an attack on Zambia, so Zambia declared war on Rhodesia. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), within this dyad. There is no indication, however, that civil conflict extended into Zambia at the time.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Zambia and Rhodesia revolved around Zambia's support for African Nationalist guerilla forces (ZAPU) that were opposed to the White regimes of both Rhodesia and South Africa. Further, much of the destabilization that created the conflicts arose from the long gap between Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 and the granting of that independence by Britain in 1980. During this period, there was a great deal of instability caused by the dispute between what the UK considered to be an illegal regime and the UK as well as rival factions based in surrounding countries.

On November 11, 1965, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia announced a state-of-emergency following Ian Smith of Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence from Britain. Zambia mobilized troops near the border on November 12, 1965. President Kaunda requested the deployment of British troops to protect the Kariba Dam on the Rhodesian-Zambian border on November 17, 1965. Zambian troops were withdrawn from the border on November 24, 1965. This was MID1804.

In January of 1966, Rhodesia placed an oil and coal embargo on Zambia, which led to US airlifts to Zambia. The situation got more hostile as the year went on. On October 14, 1966 the governments of Zambia and Mali said that the situation could only be solved by the use of force. This is MID1401 and it lasted from October 14 to November 4, 1966. When the British government did not use force, President Kaunda of Zambia accused the UK of betraying the African majority in Rhodesia to the White minority on November 15, 1966. 

On March 23, 1969, President Kaunda accused the Rhodesian air force of planning an attack on Zambian positions. On March 26, Zambian troops at battalion strength were marching toward Rhodesia. While no actual combat ensued, this is classified as MID1399.

In 1970, the South African Minister of Justice said that there were between 38,000 and 42,000 trained black guerillas in Zambia and Tanzania. On January 3 and 18 of that year, the guerilla forces crossed from Zambia into Rhodesia, killing 8 South African and 5 Rhodesian soldiers. This is MID1611.

On January 11, 1973, Zambia announced it would cut off its exports of copper and other raw materials to Rhodesia and South Africa in retaliation for the growing tensions between the countries. Later that month, Zambia accused South Africa of sending 4,000 troops to bolster the Rhodesian attempts to destabilize the country. This was classified as MID1397.

In November of 1974, there were several more clashes along the border between Zambia and Rhodesia, classified as MID1396.

There were a rash of guerilla "terrorist" attacks against the Smith regime in Rhodesia between April and August of 1976. These attacks were often targeted against civilians, and were committed by groups that were based out of Zambia. They are classified as MID1430.

MID3131 was a long series of violent disputes between May of 1977 and December of 1979. President Kaunda declared a "state of war" with Rhodesia on May 16, 1977 in response to Smith's threat of preemptive strikes against ZAPU bases in Zambia. Rhodesian troops and Zambian troops clashed near the border on May 18-19, 1977. Rhodesian military aircraft attacked Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU)-Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) targets near Feira, Zambia on August 31, 1977. Rhodesian troops and Zambian troops clashed near Kazungula on October 29-30, 1977, resulting in the deaths of 26 rebels. Rhodesian troops attacked ZAPU targets in the Gwenbe Valley in Zambia on January 30-31, 1978, resulting in the death of some 50 individuals. Rhodesian troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets in the Gwembe valley in Zambia on February 7, 1978, resulting in the deaths of some 50 rebels and eight Zambian soldiers. Rhodesian troops attacked a ZAPU-ZIPRA camp in the Luangwa district in Zambia on March 6-8, 1978, resulting in the deaths of 42 rebels, ten Zambian soldiers, and one Rhodesian soldier. Rhodesian troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets in Zambia on July 23, 1978, resulting in the deaths of 150 individuals. Rhodesian military aircraft and troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets near Lusaka, Zambia on October 19-21, 1978, resulting in the deaths of 226 rebels, 37 Zambian soldiers, and one Rhodesian soldier. Rhodesia military aircraft attacked a ZAPU refugee camp near Lusaka on November 2, 1978, resulting in the deaths of six individuals. Rhodesian troops attacked a military training school near Kabwe, Zambia on December 21-22, 1978, resulting in the deaths of 50 individuals. Rhodesian military aircraft attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA near Livingstone and Lusaka, Zambia on February 17-23, 1979, resulting in the deaths of 18 individuals. Rhodesian military aircraft and troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets near Lusaka and Mulungushi, Zambia on April 10-14, 1979, resulting in the deaths of 12 individuals. Rhodesian troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets near Lusaka on June 26-July 1, 1979, resulting in the deaths of some 50 individuals and one Rhodesian soldier. Rhodesian troops attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA camps on August 23, 1979. Rhodesian military aircraft attacked ZAPU-ZIPRA targets near Lusaka on November 2, 1979. Rhodesian troops destroyed a bridge near Lusaka on November 19, 1979, resulting in the deaths of three Zambians and one Rhodesian soldier. Rhodesia placed its military forces on full alert on November 20, 1979. 

Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Zambia restored normal diplomatic relations after Zimbabwe attained its independence from Britain on April 18, 1980. Because there have been no subsequent disputes between these countries since this date, the rivalry clearly has ended. It seems that the domestic stability that came with a final decision on the status of Rhodesia (or Zimbabwe) as well as the movement toward a more multi-racial government and military in Rhodesia during the late 1970s settled the issues that were creating friction between Zambia and Rhodesia.

MID3131 ended in December 1979. On April 18, 1980, new prospects opened before Zambia with the emergence of an independent Zimbabwe. The freedom of Zimbabwe had enabled the two countries to restore traditional economic contacts and to end the blockade of routes via Angola and Mozambique that carried cargoes for landlocked Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zambia could supply Zimbabwe with coal from the Wankie field and electricity from the Kariba dam. The emergence of independent Zimbabwe could also hinder Pretoria's expansionism. South Africa had tried to push through its concept of a constellation of southern African states, but the leaders of Zambia and other independent countries had their own views on the matter, and wanted to consolidate regional co-operation. The domestic stability that came with a final decision on the status of Rhodesia (or Zimbabwe) as well as the movement toward a more multi-racial government and military in Rhodesia during the late 1970s settled the issues that were creating friction between Zambia and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe).

On June 28, 1980, Zimbabwe and Zambia have established a joint commission of cooperation to strengthen transportation and telecommunications links between the two countries. The commission is an outcome of a two-day meeting in Salisbury between the delegations of Zimbabwe and Zambia. According to a joint communique read by Zimbabwean Minister of Finance Enos Nkala, the commission will meet twice a year to review its activities. Under the new arrangement, there will be an early reintroduction of passenger bus services between Salisbury and Lusaka. There has already been notable progress in the restoration of normal telecommunications links between the two countries. The two sides were happy with the resumption of rail and air services between the two countries.

The Zimbabwean Prime Minister, Robert Mugabe, returned to Salisbury from Lusaka on January 21, 1981, after signing a comprehensive co-operation agreement with Zambia covering economic, agricultural, technical and social affairs. In ending his one-day trip to Zambia, Comrade Mugabe called on SWAPO, as the sole legal and authentic representative of the people of Namibia, to intensify its armed struggle against the racist South African forces. Mugabe also called on the United Nations to formulate more effective pressures to force the Pretoria regime into accepting self-determination and national independence for the people of Namibia. He added: Apartheid will fail if the progressive forces of the international community pool their resources to liquidate it. Mugabe also condemned South Africa for its sabotage and destabilizing tactics in Zimbabwe and the entire South African region. He thanked the Government and people of Zambia for supporting the drive for national unity in Zimbabwe. Mugabe said Zimbabwe has adopted the policy of reconciliation and national unity to eradicate all former enemies and tribal divisions. He said the people of Zimbabwe will soon be enjoying complete peace and stability because they are now united by their hard-won independence. In his farewell speech after the signing ceremony, President Kaunda made an impassioned plea for unity in Zimbabwe. He said that, in supporting the struggle in Zimbabwe, Zambia was not sacrificing for an individual or a party but for the people of Zimbabwe. On Namibian independence question, Dr Kaunda called on the five-nation Western contact group to intensify their efforts in securing a peaceful solution to the dispute. He said that with South Africa procrastinating on the issue SWAPO has every right to continue with its noble struggle to establish social justice and independence in Namibia.

On August 2, 1981, Zimbabwean Prime Minister Mugabe thanked Zambia for her support to Zimbabwe's independence struggle and spoke highly of the relationship between the two countries. Opening the 5th Zambia agricultural and commercial show in Lusaka, Mugabe said that an atmosphere of peace and friendship has developed between the two countries and peoples. He said: "we cannot forget that our armed struggle was initiated, planned and launched from the Zambian soil." Zimbabwe's independence has also enhanced Zambia's freedom," he added. Now as partners in national construction, Zimbabwe has important lessons to learn from Zambia in consolidating her independence, he said. He stressed that the two countries should coordinate their initiatives in various fields. He also condemned South Africa's military provocation against neighboring countries. Mugabe visited Lusaka for a one-day visit at the invitation of President Kaunda.

On June 19, 1982, the Prime Minister, Comrade Mugabe, says Zimbabwe has joined the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) of east and southern Africa because it recognizes the need to create a trade zone free from the influence and interference of the Pretoria regime. Comrade Mugabe made these remarks in Livingstone when he signed the Preferential Trade Area accord with President Kaunda of Zambia and a representative of the Economic Commission for Africa. The Prime Minister, who has since returned to Harare, said the PTA should in time result in a zone as economically independent and strong as that of the European Economic Community. Robert Mugabe said Zimbabwe and Zambia can play a vital role in the Southern African Development [Coordination] Conference, SADCC, because of their geographical position. Speaking at the same occasion, the Zambian leader, Dr Kaunda, said Zimbabwe and his country have inherited a colonialist heritage which should be exploited to the benefit of the two countries. He praised our Prime Minister for pursuing the policy of reconciliation and hoped that Zimbabwe will succeed in its development program. The two leaders earlier held discussions at the Livingstone civic centre during which bilateral issues covering trade, economic and cultural relations were discussed. They also exchanged views on international issues including the situation in Namibia. The two countries have agreed to hold a joint meeting of the Zambian-Zimbabwe permanent commission in August in Livingstone. The meeting is expected to discuss trade relations, transfer of assets and the movement of people of the two countries across the common border. Robert Mugabe was accompanied on his one-day visit to Zambia by three Government Ministers and senior Government officials.

On 18th June, 1983, a delegation from Zimbabwe's Transport Ministry was visiting Zambia for routine talks on the unitary railway system between the two countries. The Zimbabwean and Zambian Transport Ministries had agreed to limit their national airlines' flights to three a week each way, quoted a statement by an official of Zimbabwe's Ministry of Transport that the proposals were based on a realistic assessment of the traffic situation between the two countries; he had said the bilateral air service agreement, which now had to be approved by the two Governments, would supersede the temporary operating permits in use since 1980.

Passenger train services between Zambia and Zimbabwe resumed on July 15, 1983, after an interruption of 18 years. The services were suspended in 1965 when the then Rhodesia was unilaterally declared independent. Commenting on the resumption, Zambian minister of power, transport and communications, Chinkuli said: "the inauguration of passenger train services between the two countries is within the spirit of the Southern African development coordination conference and preferential trade area" and "it marks a new era in the economic, political and social development of the two countries."

The second meeting of the Zimbabwe-Zambia joint commission for co-operation opened in Harare on 16th February, 1984, chaired by the Minister of Finance, Economic Planning and the Development, Bernard Chidzero, and the Zambian Minister of the National Commission for Development Planning, Dr Henry Meebelo. Bernard Chidzero said since the first meeting in Livingstone, Zambia, in 1983, progress had been made to implement some of the projects agreed upon, and wipe out the bottlenecks which had been [word indistinct], the development of the joint commission such as the financial and monetary issues. Dr Meebele said among the advances made by the two countries was the establishment of air services, bus services which will be resumed soon, and the signing of an agreement between ZIANA and the Zambia News Agency, which will take place at the end of the joint commission meeting. Zimbabwe and Zambia have signed three co-operation agreements in Harare on 17th February, 1984, including the exchange of news between the Zimbabwean and Zambian news agencies and co-operation with air services. The third was on the second session of the joint commission of the two countries.

On 15th July, 1986, a Zimbabwean Cabinet Minister called for improved participation by Zambia and Zimbabwe in the Southern Africa Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), and the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) to strengthen their economies, ZIANA reports. Opening the fourth session of the Zimbabwe/Zambia joint commission in Harare, the Minister of Energy and Water Resources and Development, Mr Kumbirai Kangai, said the two countries should adhere to the principles of these regional organizations. ''We must adhere to the principles and objectives of the regional organization of SADCC and PTA, and our vigorous participation in those organizations will strengthen our states'', he said. He said Zimbabwe and Zambia were responsible for securing reliable outlets to the sea if their economies were to be viable. This fourth meeting between the two sides follows an agreement on the establishment of a joint commission for co-operation, signed in 1981 between Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and the Zimbabwean Prime Minister, Mr Robert Mugabe. Co-operation in the fields of agriculture, youth, sport and culture, air service and communication are among matters to be discussed during the current session.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and the visiting Zimbabwean Prime Minister Robert Mugabe on July 2, 1987, stressed continued unity among their peoples to ensure the success of Africa's political and economic development. During their talks here this afternoon, the two leaders highly evaluated the sacrifices made by the peoples of Zambia and Zimbabwe in the fight against racism and apartheid. Kaunda hailed the warm bilateral ties which are growing from strength to strength. The two countries could also boast of joint membership of a number of regional and international bodies. Mugabe praised Zambia for having provided a base for Zimbabwe during its liberation struggle saying that Zambia is the cradle of the Zimbabwean revolution. Before Zambia and Zimbabwe won independence, the two countries were called the federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. After Zambia's independence in 1964, it offered support to the Zimbabwean revolution and provided a base for Zimbabwe's liberation struggle. Mugabe said what is needed now for Africa is reconciliation and reconstruction instead of recrimination and destruction. The African revolution should not be allowed to be marred by enemy machinations, he added. Mugabe arrived in Lusaka on July 2, 1987, for his first official visit to Zambia after his country's independence in 1980.

Trade between Zambia and Zimbabwe has increased tenfold over the past twelve months since the Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) set up a subsidiary in Harare in April 1988. The volume of trade between the two countries grew from about one million kwacha to ten million kwacha in value terms during the period. ZCCM, the largest copper producer in Zambia, is the main trading partner of Zimbabwe. Zambia mainly imports from Zimbabwe steel rods, coke, buses, refrigeration equipment, grinding media, steel sections, piping and safety equipment. The annual volume of imports from Zimbabwe has increased from four million Zimbabwean dollars to 40 million Zimbabwean dollars.

Zambia is to earn about 2m US dollars from cement exports to Zimbabwe, Zambian Finance Minister Gibson Chigaga said on 1st November, 1990, in Lusaka. Speaking at the end of the seventh session of the Zambia-Zimbabwe joint permanent commission in the Zambian capital, Chigaga hailed Zimbabwe for the steps it has taken to improve trade between the two neighboring countries. Zimbabwe has increased foreign exchange allocations to enable its local companies to import from preferential (PTA) member states with a view to boosting trade among the members. The two-day meeting examined possibilities for enhancing co-operation in the fields of agriculture, tourism, mining, education, sports and social welfare. Chigaga described the session as a success saying it would go a long way to improve relations between the two nations.

Democratically elected President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia got a red-carpet welcome and an embrace on December 9, 1991, from President Robert Mugabe, a champion of the one-party state in a continent of political change. The autocrat and the democrat beamed and chatted animatedly at Harare Airport under occasional light rain, dispelling concern about a tense meeting. Chiluba, 48, a trade union leader, was elected on October 31, 1991, in Zambia's first multiparty elections since 1968. He beat Zambian founding father Kenneth Kaunda, 67, who was in power 27 years and had banned the opposition in 1973. Mugabe, 67, a onetime guerrilla leader who led Zimbabwe to independence from Britain 11 years ago, waited for four days after the election before congratulating Chiluba. Instead, Mugabe sent a glowing message to Kaunda, a staunch political ally, lauding him for accepting the crushing defeat and stepping down from power. After talks with Mugabe, Chiluba told reporters that relations between the two countries remained "pretty good." "As you can see, President Mugabe is smiling," he said, pointing to his host at State House. "That is a genuine smile and I am smiling too." Chiluba proclaimed upon taking over, "What we've done here should send signals across our borders to neighboring countries." He leaves Harare for Mozambique on the next stop of a five-nation tour of neighboring countries to meet their leaders.

Zambia's high commissioner to Zimbabwe Rodger Sakuhuka has said the change of government in his country in 1991 will not affect the existing cooperation between the two countries. In a meeting with Zimbabwean acting president Joshua Nkomo on November 26, 1992, Sakuhuka said Zambia will continue to cooperate with Zimbabwe to accelerate development in the two countries. "Cooperation between our two countries will not be affected by the new government which came into power in October 1991. Bilateral relations should be strengthened for the mutual benefit of both countries," the high commissioner was quoted as saying. The present Zambian government of President Frederick Chiluba came to power after winning the country's first multi-party elections since independence.

On August 20, 1993, Zambia has banned all imports of agricultural products from Zimbabwe in apparent retaliation for a similar ban on Zambian farm products. According to local reports, the ban was announced by Zambia's secretary for agriculture Jonathan Chizuni, who said it will remain effective until Zimbabwe lifts its ban on Zambian agricultural products. "If we cannot sell to them, we must never allow them to sell to us," said Chizuni, adding that Zimbabwe is still shielding itself behind protectionist tendencies, which are not good for regional agricultural development. A senior official in the Zimbabwean ministry of land, agriculture and water development said Zimbabwe is not aware of the ban as it has not been told by Zambia. Zimbabwe farmers' union president Gary Magadzire said the ban on Zimbabwean agricultural imports is unfortunate and the issue should have been amicably resolved before the ban takes effect. "I am sure a solution could have been found. We need each other and there is a need for dialogue," he said.

Zambian and Zimbabwean ministers have reaffirmed to strengthen bilateral relations in the defense and security fields. At the 11th session of the Zambia-Zimbabwe joint permanent commission on defense and security, which opened in Lusaka on October 22, 1993, the Zambian defense minister Ben Mwila said Zambia will adhere to the objectives of the commission so that the bilateral relations will be strengthened. He also apologized to the Zimbabwean side for delay in convening the session which he attributed to the transitional political process in Zambia. "This meeting should have been held much earlier after the change of government in Zambia but we were settling down before we could attend to issues of this nature," he explained. He hoped meetings of the commission will be regular both at national and border levels. At the same occasion, Zimbabwean minister of state for national security Sydney Sekeramayi said Zimbabwe looks forward to cementing relations with Zambia. On the democratic process in Zambia, Sekeramayi said the success achieved in Zambia will inspire other countries in the region and his country is keen to learn from Zambia's experiences. The session will discuss problems of security and smuggling on the common border.

Zambia said on July 27, 1994, that it has pulled out of a joint project with Zimbabwe to build a hydro-electric plant on the Zambezi River. The Minister of Energy and Water Development, Edith Nawakwi, said Zambia had decided to pull out because of disputes with Zimbabwe. The Zambesi River forms part of the border between the two countries. Nawakwi said Zambia stood to gain less from the Batoka Gorge scheme than Zimbabwe. There were also problems centring round the former Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO) which remained unresolved. She added that justice ministers of both countries were examining ways out of the impasse. The project, which was to built an 800 megawatt power station on the Zambian side of the Zambesi, was opposed by conservationists who argued that it would affect ecology in the area.

On October 16, 1994, an ownership wrangle over a 28-year-old power station on the Zambezi River is souring relations between Zimbabwe and its northern neighbor Zambia but the two countries have agreed to take the issue to international arbitration. Zambian Energy Minister Edith Nawakwi, said recently that the 1,600 megawatt Batoka Hydro-electricity power project on the Kariba north bank was financed by Zambia and therefore Zimbabwe had no legitimate claim over it. The energy minister said Zambia had appealed to the International Court of Justice at the Hague for arbitration. In 1965 the now-disbanded Central Africa Power Corporation (CAPCO)-jointly owned by both countries-secured an 80 million U.S. dollar loan from the World Bank and 20 million dollars from Zambian lending institutions to finance the project during the colonial Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Both loans were guaranteed by Zambia, and the financial burden borne by Zambia, which is still paying back the debt. Following the 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Zambia wanted to draw power from its own independent source as previously it got from the same Kariba southern bank source as its southern neighbor Rhodesia. "We realized we were dealing with Ian Smith (former rebel Rhodesian leader), and that he could cut power to Zambia anytime because we were harboring liberation fighters," Zambia's energy director, Dominic Mbewe, told Zimbabwe's independent weekly, the Financial Gazette. Zambia has since been servicing the debt, while the assets were leased to the jointly owned CAPCO. Some five years ago when CAPCO was dissolved and later revived as the Zambezi River Authority, Zimbabwe which paid rentals under the lease agreement, claimed capital contribution to the CAPCO assets, and the two agreed to share them on a half-half basis. The dispute now is on the ownership of the Kariba north power station itself with Zambia saying since it financed its construction, it wholly owns it, but Zimbabwe argues that as CAPCO was jointly owned, the station should be jointly owned. Zimbabwean government spokesman Bornwell Chakaodza said that it was agreed to take the matter to the Hague after lawyers from the two countries examined the long-drawn case. Zimbabwe would abide by the decision of the international court, Chakaodza said. Relations between the two neighboring countries have not been at their best since President Fredrick Chiluba took over in 1991 from Kenneth Kaunda, who had a close relationship with President Robert Mugabe during his decades in power. Since then trade differences have erupted between the two countries and Zimbabwe has accused Zambian poachers of depleting this country's black rhino herd, which until recently was still largest in the world. "Zambia will exercise caution before entering into any joint ventures with Zimbabwe given the turbulent history of existing ventures," Nawakwi said.

A dispute between Air Zimbabwe and Zambia's civil aviation authorities over flight slots on April 1, 1995, left some 74 passengers stranded in the two countries' capitals. Zambia refused permission to Air Zimbabwe to fly its scheduled service from here to Lusaka enroute to Frankfurt and London as Zambia's new airline, Aero Zambia which replaced the defunct state-owned Zambia Airways, can now fly into Harare. Aero Zambia was according to a Zimbabwe government statement granted a permit to operate between Harare and Lusaka. But the route and other international ones was serviced by Zimbabwe's national airline since October 1994, when Zambia Airways was liquidated. The disagreement arose from whether Aero Zambia should inherit all the slots left by its predecessor. Aero Zambia claims it aborted it inaugural flight to Harare because it had been hampered by Air Zimbabwe. Air Zimbabwe, it is understood, will use road transport to ferry its Lusaka-bound passengers.

Zimbabwe will not close its border with Zambia as advocated by some Zambian opposition parties, three senior Zimbabwe government officials said on June 27, 1996. We respect Zambia's sovereignty and would concentrate on issues of mutual interest, Zimbabwe's high commissioner, John Kangai said, adding that the two countries were bound by joint agreements which spurned moves like closing common borders. Zimbabwe's transport and energy minister, Simon Moyo, described calls for border closure as without basis and justification.

On August 23, 1996, the Zimbabwe-Zambia border post at Victoria falls crossing has been closed temporarily as a result of Zimbabwean Immigration and Customs officers downing tools in support of the civil servants' country wide strike. Thousands of people wishing to cross to and from Zimbabwe have been marooned at the border post with most having attempted to jump over the fences. Immigration Officers and Zambia Revenue Authority officials from the Zambian side have expressed worry at the way things were being handled because there was no formal notification from their colleagues. Foreign tourists from South African and abroad have failed to cross over to Zambia as they could not be attended to. A survey showed that Zimbabwean civil servants on strike at the border have locked all gates and were not allowing any one to come near the border. Police officers from Zimbabwe manning the place have threatened to shoot any Zambian or foreigners attempting to cross illegally. A number of foreigners on connecting air flights have missed their planes and have been marooned at Musi-oa-Tunya Hotel Inter-Continental here. The strike if prolonged would affect movements at borders of both sides and business would be paralyzed.

On December 8, 1997, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba left for Zimbabwe on a one-day working visit at the invitation of President Robert Mugabe. He told reporters before departure at Lusaka International Airport that he and Mugabe would discuss issues affecting the sub-region as well as bilateral relations. Asked whether he would discuss with Mugabe reports that former President Kenneth Kaunda is seeking asylum in Zimbabwe, Chiluba said he has no official information about the issue. Kaunda has not returned to Zambia since the foiled coup of Oct. 28, which occurred when he was out of the country.

On August 27, 1998, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba left for Zimbabwe at the invitation of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. According to a foreign affairs spokesman in Lusaka, President Chiluba was scheduled to open the Zimbabwe Agricultural show.

White farmers may not be welcome in Zimbabwe these days, but that does not mean they are unwanted elsewhere in Africa. On July 2, 2000, Zimbabwe's northern neighbor, Zambia, has quietly put out the word that it has millions of acres of land just begging for farmers. The land itself is practically free-it can be leased for 50 cents an acre a year. "We have a lot of surplus land," said Duresh M. Desai, Zambia's minister of agriculture. "Our problem is to attract investment to put that land into agricultural production." Desai and other Zambian officials are getting lots of inquiries from farmers in Zimbabwe, where political militants have violently invaded hundreds of white-owned commercial farms, killing five farmers and 26 others, mostly black supporters of the opposition party. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has said he will redistribute the farms to poor blacks. If Mugabe's ruling political party wins hotly contested parliamentary elections this weekend, officials expect emigration to increase. "Zambia is making very clever inroads," said Danny Meyer, the former head of the Zimbabwean National Chamber of Commerce who is encouraging white farmers to diversify into Zambia. "Zimbabwe's problems are like a godsend to Zambia." Zambia is not the only country making overtures to Zimbabwe's farmers, whose immense farms are among the most efficient in Africa, on par with North American agriculture. Zimbabwe's commercial farms account for a fifth of the country's economy and generate a third of its foreign exchange. Mozambique, like Zambia a formerly socialist state that is opening up to private investors, is also recruiting in Zimbabwe, a former British colony known as Rhodesia before independence in 1980. "Mozambique is aggressively head-hunting," said Richard Amyot, a spokesman for Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers' Union. "The Zambian government has made entreaties to us. Even places like Rwanda and Uganda, where there isn't much available land, have expressed an interest. The skills of Zimbabwean farmers are valued in the region." The farmers' union, whose members own most of Zimbabwe's best farmland, is not encouraging its members to emigrate. "It's almost against our best interest," said Amyot. "To be frank, we can't afford to dilute our community." But Mugabe is practically forcing them to leave, having declared white farmers enemies of the state. The Herald, a government-owned newspaper, reported that white farmers are heading to Zimbabwe's borders in droves with tractors in tow. Those reports appear to be overstated. Officials in Zambia say the migration is insignificant now, but interest is becoming intense. "I'm getting a couple of calls and e-mail a day," said Songowayo Zyambo, the director of the Zambia National Farmers' Union, who considers the interest from Zimbabweans with irony. White farmers in Zimbabwe once regarded Zambia as an unfriendly neighbor because it hosted black guerrillas in the 1970s who sought to overthrow Rhodesia's white-minority government. Most Zimbabweans still think of Zambia as a primitive nation unworthy of visiting for either business or pleasure. "We've been basically a laughingstock," said Zyambo. "It's only now that the Zimbabweans are having trouble that they're interested in us." Twice the size of Zimbabwe with a smaller population, most of Zambia's 10 million people are concentrated in urban areas because the country's economy traditionally depended upon copper mines rather than agriculture. Large commercial farms in Zambia are increasingly aiming their production at the export market, specializing in tobacco, flowers and vegetables. There is none of the competition for land that characterizes Zimbabwe's racially charged politics, said Desai, the agriculture minister. Desai says Zambia has almost 200,000 square miles of farmland available _ that's more than all the land in Zimbabwe, a country the size of California. "There's no land in America that's better than ours," said Ron Landless, a commercial farmer near Lusaka whose family settled in Zambia 76 years ago, when the former British colony was known as Northern Rhodesia. "We have good soil, comfortable temperatures and abundant rainfall." The government is trying to attract Zimbabwean farmers primarily to 3.5 million acres of unoccupied land along an underused, 500-mile-long railroad that runs from Kapiri Mposhi in central Zambia to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The Tazara Railway was built in the 1970s to provide Zambian copper with an outlet to Tanzanian ports. Zambia has other advantages. Labor is cheap: Farmers pay workers $1 a day, plus food and housing. The Zambian government also has waived duties on the import of farm equipment and delayed taxes for new farms for five years. It taxes farm income at 15 percent, half the rate for other businesses. "We've created an attractive investment climate," Desai said. "We have a lot going for us naturally and there is a lot government has put in place to facilitate agriculture." With so much going for it, one might expect a land rush of sodbusters. But that has not happened. There is little credit available and interest rates exceed 50 percent, so Zambia is looking for farmers with cash. Most farmers in Zimbabwe are cash-poor and they are deeply in debt and unable to sell their farms. "What we want are people to bring in what we don't have, expertise and capital," Desai said. "The land is literally free." Zambia is also relatively primitive. In rural areas, electricity is intermittent, the telephone system is rudimentary, the roads are poor. Fuel costs $4 a gallon. Because there are so few farmers, markets for products are underdeveloped. "If a farmer needs a new nut or bolt, he has to drive 300 miles to get it," said Penroy Morris, a British consultant to the Tazara Railway development project. Investor confidence in Zambia has also not recovered from three decades of socialism. Many white farmers left after Zambia won independence from Britain in 1964, and only a few remained after the government nationalized all land in 1974. All land remains in government hands: Farms are rented on renewable 99-year leases. Zambia began to liberalize its economy and privatize state assets after Frederick Chiluba was elected president in the country's first multiparty elections in 1991. White South African farmers began to move to Zambia the next year to flee drought and the uncertainty following the end of South Africa's white-minority government. "They made it seem like a land of milk and honey," said Daniel Kruger, who has 3,750 acres of corn under cultivation near the town of Mkushi. But he said when interest rates hit 160 percent in 1992, more than half the 50 South Africans went under. "You can make money here, but you have to work hard," Kruger said. One thing Zambia does not have is the racial animosity of Zimbabwe or South Africa, where whites obtained the best farmland and relegated blacks to the worst. "The overall feeling of Zambia is positive," Kruger said. "We're not treated as racists. They know I'm here to make money, but they see I'm working hand in hand with them."

On November 29, 2000, a Zambia-Zimbabwe joint commission has expressed satisfaction with increasing cooperation between the two countries in the sphere of defense and security. There has been growing cooperation between the two neighbors in combating drug trafficking, cross border poaching and illegal immigration, the Zambia-Zimbabwe Joint Permanent Commission said in a communique issued after a series of meetings held in Ndola in Zambia's central Copperbelt Province recently. The commission, which comprises Zambian Home Affair Minister Peter Machungwa and his Zimbabwean counterpart John Nkomo and other senior officials from both countries, expressed support for the land redistribution program in Zimbabwe. It also re-affirmed the two countries' support to the efforts by the international community, including the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, in finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflicts in the region.

On December 20, 2000, two months after countries of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa or COMESA set up a Free Trade Area or FTA, Zambia and Zimbabwe are still trading accusations over unfair trade dealings. Zambian government officials and manufacturers believe Zimbabwe, their neighbor to the south, is an "unfair trading partner," who wants the scales tilted in her favor. But Zimbabwe government officials are also recriminating bitterly that Zambia has put in place "very unfair trade practices." "There are problems on both sides. Zimbabwean exporters are also complaining of difficulties in exporting their products to Zambia," said Tirivafi Kangai, Zimbabwe's High Commissioner to Zambia and Dean of African diplomats in Lusaka. Both countries are members of the recently launched COMESA-FTA as well as founding States of the Southern African Development Community or SADC, a regional grouping dating from the days of anti-colonial struggle. Ironically, Zimbabwe and Zambia at the weekend signed a cooperation agreement in Harare designed to advance their trade and economic cooperation ties. But the agreement, struck after three days of intense negotiations between teams of trade experts, led by Foreign Ministers of the two countries, appears to have failed to bridge the rift. Armando Lopes, Managing Director of Zambian National Milling came up with fresh charges that the Grain Marketing Board of Zimbabwe was blocking his company from exporting maize flour to Zimbabwe. Maize flour is the staple food for much of Southern Africa. Lopes told Agriculture Deputy Minister Enock Chikamba, who was touring his factory, that denials by the Zimbabwe government that it was not practicing unfair trade had no basis because his company has proof. "If Zimbabwe can export wheat flour to Zambia, why can't Zambia export mealie meal (maize flour) to Zimbabwe?" he asked. Zambia National Farmers Union President, Ajay Vashee, has also accused the Grain Marketing Board of Zimbabwe of consistently blocking Zambian exports from reaching the Zimbabwe market. "We do not see why one agency should be the one to determine whether we can export anything to Zimbabwe or not, because the FTA implies that there should be no restrictions to trade," he pointed out. Vashee at one time threatened to lodge an official complaint with the COMESA Secretariat in Lusaka over alleged barriers erected by Zimbabwe to wheat and maize exports. COMESA Secretary-General, Erastus Mwencha, had promised to take up the Zambian farmers' complaint. In a move linked to the trade imbalance, a Zambian company, Amanita Zambiana, recently wound up operations in Lusaka with a view to relocating to Zimbabwe where wheat production and milling costs are said to be low. Zambian wheat farmers' Representative, Tim Ashworth, supported the move saying unless government leveled the playing field before the next wheat planting season in April 2001, Zambia could face the possibility of importing flour from Zimbabwe. "If the issue is not resolved by April, either the donors would have to give Zambia 120,000 tons of wheat or 27 million US dollars to pay Zimbabwe for 100,000 tons of flour," Ashworth said. Zimbabwe Industry and International Trade Minister, Nkosana Moyo, admits there is a trade imbalance between the two countries but blames "authorities" who failed to sign a bilateral trade agreement over the past eight years. While on a visit to Zambia, he said Zambia and Zimbabwe had drawn up a bilateral agreement in 1993, but the document had remained unimplemented. But many Zambians disagree with this argument. Vice-president, Christon Tembo, has suggested to COMESA to set up an FTA implementation task-force in each member-state, to monitor implementation of trade rules and regulations to avoid cheating. In the meantime, the wrangling between the neighboring countries continues.

Zimbabwe should not be isolated when it is facing some problems, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on February 2, 2001. Receiving credentials from the new Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia Ndabazekhaya Mathame at State House, President Chiluba said the problems Zimbabwe faced were similar to those faced by other countries in the region. "Zambia and Zimbabwe will continue to work together because we share common ideals and interests," President Chiluba said. He said the two countries had enjoyed very warm relations and that there was need to work together because the region was faced with a lot of conflicts which need unity to overcome. President Chiluba said co-operation between the two countries and in the region was very vital and Zambia would continue to co-operate. President Chiluba said there was very little to worry about on the bilateral relations between Zambia and Zimbabwe as the two countries had worked well together. He advised High Commissioner Mathame to consult and seek clarification from government on anything that was likely to spark any problems between the two neighboring countries. High Commissioner Mathame said Zimbabwe cherished the relations between the two countries which dates back during the liberation struggle. He said Zambia was a dependable friend who had been very supportive. High Commissioner Mathame has replaced John Kangai who has been transferred to Vienna, Austria.

The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) said in Lusaka, on July 22, 2002, that Zambia and Zimbabwe have reached a tentative agreement on how to resolve a long-standing wrangle on uneven trade practices. COMESA, which mediated in the meeting earlier the previous week, said the two countries agreed valuation of trade goods leaving Zimbabwe for Zambia should be done using the Zambian kwacha to ensure the prices of imports are at par with locally manufactured goods. Sindiso Ngwenya, acting COMESA secretary-general, told journalists the meeting identified parallel exchange rates in Zimbabwe as the main problem in the trade between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The government in Harare applies a given exchange rate. Zambia and Zimbabwe have now adopted the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) system of valuation as an interim general rule while awaiting new rules to be formulated by COMESA and the World Trade Organization. In addition, the two countries will ensure Zimbabwean goods entering Zambia will priced at the local market value. However, officials at Zambia's Ministry of Commerce described the tentative agreement as being far less than what was expected, saying that Zambia complained repeatedly to COMESA about Zimbabwe's unfair trade practices but the secretariat took no action. The officials said the Zambian government intends to stick to the decision of keeping out 14 categories of goods from Zimbabwe that were deemed to be encouraging the closure of factories in Zambia. Thousands of Zambian workers have lost their jobs because of cheap imports from Zimbabwe. Among trade goods that cannot be imported into Zambia from Zimbabwe are cigarettes, bananas, timber, wheat, dairy products, blankets, footwear and cement. Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are members of the COMESA Free Trade Area. When Zimbabwe's foreign exchange position worsened, Zambian manufacturers complained that cheap and sub-standard goods from Zimbabwe were flooding the market, virtually forcing them out of business. Among these were Chilanga Cement and the British-American Tobacco Company, whose factory in the Zambian capital Lusaka was almost closing because of cheap cigarettes from Zimbabwe.

The second session of the Zimbabwe-Zambia Joint Permanent Commission started in Lusaka on June 4, 2003. Besides cementing the excellent relations that exist between the two countries, the second session will deliberate on issues of mutual interest, covering trade, finance, energy, labor, tourism, agriculture, health, science and technology. Zambia is Zimbabwe's third-largest trading partner in the region. The joint commission is expected to iron out impediments to the free flow of trade between the two countries. The Zimbabwe delegation will be led by the minister of foreign affairs, Dr Stan Mudenge. Besides other government ministers and officials, the delegation will also be accompanied by officials from the chamber of commerce and Zimtrade.

Visiting Zambian army commander Isaac Chisuzi has called for increased cooperation between his country and Zimbabwe. Chisuzi was speaking in Harare, on June 22, 2003, at a banquet organized in his honor by his Zimbabwean counterpart Constantine Chiwenga. "Zambia and Zimbabwe are one," he said. "Lets go back to be one people." "We are only divided by borders, but we have a lot of intermarriages. Zambians can speak Shona and Ndebele and Zimbabweans can speak Zambian dialects," he added. Chisuzi was in Zimbabwe on a reciprocal visit following the visit by Chiwenga to Zambia the previous year. The visit was part of confidence building in accordance with the Southern African Development Community defense and security protocol. Chiwenga said Zambians had been true friends to Zimbabwe as they played a pivotal role during the country's liberation struggle. "People of Zambia sacrificed for Zimbabwe's independence," he said. "Zambia was bombed, lives were lost and its economy was damaged. Such was Zambia's commitment to our struggle. I am proud to say a friend in need is a friend indeed." Chiwenga said Zambia played a pivotal role in bringing peace to the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He said the country provided a passage for the Zimbabwe National Army to access the DRC. Zimbabwe send troops to the DRC together with Namibia and Angola to defend the DRC government that was under attack from rebels aided by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Zambia chaired some of the important meetings meant to bring peace to the central African country.

The trade impasse between Zimbabwe and Zambia is far from over despite the Zambia-Zimbabwe Joint Commission meeting held in Zambia on June 30, 2003. Rudo Faranisi, a director with the Ministry of Industry and International Trade, was quoted as saying that the two countries had agreed to implement several measures aimed at resolving the impasse within specified time frames. The talks also centered on delays in Zambia's response to a draft submitted by Zimbabwe on bilateral trade, which Zambia promised to do a week from the conclusion of the meeting. Faranisi admitted that while Zambians had agreed to cooperate on a number of issues including the recognition of the official exchange rate, not much progress had been made taking into account the situation on the ground. The Zambians have been accused of trying to stifle exports from Zimbabwe through assorted means which include banning Zimbabwean products from being exported to their country. The Zambians, on the other hand, have been defending their position citing the need to protect their industries, which are being threatened by alleged dumping of goods from Zimbabwe. The blame has also been put on Zimbabwean exporters who have been accused of undervaluing their products to avoid paying tax. The exporters said their goods were being rendered uncompetitive because of the criteria that were being used by the Zambian Revenue Authority to calculate Value Added Tax. A case manager with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Peter Dube, said the Zambians had proposed that local exporters value their goods in local currency while exporting. Zimbabwe has lost its place as the major exporter to Zambia due to the trade impasse. Exports from Zimbabwe to Zambia at 7.5 percent of the total exports to Zambia have been overtaken by exports from South Africa which account for 67.1 percent and those from the United Kingdom which are at 9.8 percent.

Zambia has temporarily suspended exporting crude oil to Zimbabwe after fuel shortages hit Zambia as a result of technical fault at its Indeni oil refinery plant, local official said on September 20, 2004. A senior official with the Zimbabwean Ministry of Energy and Power Development said that Zambia suspended exporting oil to Zimbabwe following the fuel shortage that the country is currently experiencing. "The suspension will be lifted once the oil situation improves in Zambia. Zambia's Ministry of Energy informed us that the move was inevitable as the current stock in their country was failing to meet domestic requirements," said the official. "Fuel shortage in Zambia was caused by a defect in the machinery at the country's sole oil refinery plant. The plant is currently being attended to. Zimbabwe is not the only country affected as Zambia has suspended all exports to other countries that benefit from them," the official said. He said once Zambia addresses the technical fault, normal supplies to Zimbabwe would resume. The official said the temporary suspension would not affect the fuel situation as measures had been taken to avert shortages. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe recently availed 10 million US dollars to facilitate the release of bonded stocks of fuel in the country to improve the fuel situation, and another 20 million US dollars was also made available to the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe for purposes of importing fuel in the past one and a half months. The move by the central bank came as fuel queues were beginning to resurface in Zimbabwe at the beginning of the month following reports of fuel shortages in the country.

There is need to remove any hurdles impeding the implementation of decisions that enhance co-operation between Zimbabwe and Zambia, Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister Retired Lieutenant General Ronnie Shikapwasha has said on February 14, 2006. Officially opening the 14th session of the Zimbabwe-Zambia Joint Commission in Harare, Rtd Lt Gen Shikapwasha said the two countries had made major strides in implementing decisions while others were still outstanding. "I am happy to note that Zimbabwe has continued to be one of Zambia's major trading partners in the region. "It is no doubt that the entry into force of the Comesa (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) Free Trade Area and the implementation of the SADC Trade Protocol have further enhanced trade between the two countries and in the region as a whole. "Zambia and Zimbabwe are privileged to be endowed with one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the mighty Victoria Falls. It is, therefore, important that we guard it jealously and earn from it the much-needed foreign exchange," he said. Speaking at the same occasion, Minister of Foreign Affairs Cde Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said the experiences that Zimbabwe has gone through had shown that to achieve sustainable development, there was need to rely on "ourselves within the region". "In this regard, this session serves to re-strengthen the firm foundation for co-operation between our two nations bearing in mind that Zambia is Zimbabwe's largest trading partner in Comesa," said the minister. "We are committed to make Zimbabwe-Zambia trade relations become a model for intra-Comesa trade, especially as we both implement the Comesa Free Trade Area regime." He commended the co-operation between both countries' power utilities Zesa Holdings and Zambia Electricity Supply Company (Zesco). A number of reciprocal missions had taken place at official and ministerial levels under the auspices of the Zambezi River Authority Council of Ministers, he said. "A notable achievement of this companionship was evidenced by the presentation to the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) of the Batoka Power Project for prioritisation and financing," said Cde Mumbengegwi. The Zimbabwe-Zambia Joint Commission was signed in 1981. Issues to be discussed during the current session include trade and industry, particularly bilateral trade agreements, exchange rate, transit fees for truckers and worsening balance of trade figures. On finance and investment, the Joint Commission would discuss issues like the avoidance of double taxation, agreement on and construction of a new border post at Chirundu. With regard to tourism, the Joint Commission is expected to discuss wildlife, commercial river uses on the Zambezi and alleged harassment of Zambian nationals while on educational and training sojourns in Zimbabwe. Technical and vocational education and twinning of schools and establishment of common strategies in dealing with HIV/Aids among pupils, energy and power, the power purchase agreement, and the Batoka Power Project would also be discussed. Other topics for discussion include information and publicity, social welfare science and technology and immigration. Proposed new areas of co-operation would focus on local government, health, labor, anti-corruption measures and new aspects of science and technology.
