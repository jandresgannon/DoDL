NARRATIVE CR:
The rivalry between Argentina and France was largely due to French intervention in Argentinian affairs, brought about by the French need to protect economic interests in the region, particularly the Rio de la Plata. This protection was necessary largely due to the foreign policy of Argentinian dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas who sought to consolidate and expand Argentina's power internally and in neighboring Uruguay.

The rivalry began with French naval forces blockading Buenos Aires in March 1838 in an effort to destabilize the regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas. This was largely due to Rosas' interference in French trading in the Rio de la Plata region along with the issue of the status of French nationals living in Argentina. The blockade lasted until October 29, 1840. In addition to the blockade, the French militarily supported General Lavalle, a Rosas rival, in attempting rebellion. Lavalle had been intstumental in bringing Rosas' rival Fructuoso Rivera to the presidency in Uruguay, ousting Rosas' ally Manuel Oribe. The rebellion in Argentina failed by 1841. The rebellion in Argentina failed by 1841 but led to a series of terror campaigns by the Rosas' administration. In January 1842, France and Great Britain sent a naval ships to Argentina to monitor these terror campaigns and protect their citizens against possible attacks, MID371. Oribe, did assist Rosas in defeating the rebellion and his efforts led to an opportunity to take back power in Uruguay by 1843. Rosas and Oribe together began a siege on Montevideo in 1843 to accomplish this task, imposing a blockade on the city as well.

This siege on Montevideo led to both French and British intervention to break the blockade in 1843 (MID2055). In addition, the British and French began naval operations to open all Argentine and Uruguayan rivers to free navigation. In September 1845, both French and naval forces imposed a blockade on Buenos Aires (MID123). Both naval efforts failed, leaving Rosas even more powerful by 1846 when the blockade ended. This status for Rosas was very temporary, however, as pro-European groups within Buenos Aires in addition to provencial adversaries began rebelling against his regime. Justo Urquiza, a rival caudillo, led the revolt against Rosas which proved successful by 1852. Thus, a new regime was implemented that was sympathetic to European interests.

After Rosas' fall, the new regime began economic reform, stipulating its policy of economic liberalism in its new constitution written in 1853. This constitution also provided for presidential elections the same year which Urquiza won. Immediately Urquiza signed commerical treaties were with France, Great Britain and the United States and began encouraging foreign investment. Additionally Urquiza opened up Argentine rivers to free navigation for foreign trade. These policies led to expansion of French and British commerical ventures such as railroad building and exploration of the Chaco. This regime change then ended the rivalry between France and Argentina due to the new regime's openness to French economic interests which had been the cause of initial French intervention in the country. While it should be noted that Urquiza lost power after a civil conflict with rival Bartolome Miter in 1861, Argentine political affairs did not further threaten foreign commerical interests and instead strengthened its relations with Europe both politically, socially and economically.

It should be noted that the final mid in 1916 (MID1726 on 5/15) involved shipping during World War I and involved none of the issues making up the earlier rivalry.
