TERRMID: MID2567 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID2567 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2567 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, South Yemeni jets forced down a Djibouti airliner in Lebanon, and the plane was released 4 hours later. Coded not territory because the countries were not disputing a boundary, and coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped since it does not meet the 24-hour requirement of seizing a plane to be considered a MID.
