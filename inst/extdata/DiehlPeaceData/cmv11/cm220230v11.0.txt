TERRMID-NOTES: MID2309 from Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016), Spanish and French soldiers got into what the French and Spanish governments called a "drunken brawl," in which a few troops exchanged fire. Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped, as the governments did not protest and agreed that this was not recognized as an incident by either.
