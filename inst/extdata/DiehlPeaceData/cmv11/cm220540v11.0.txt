CIVWARLINK-CER: MID2150 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. The Zaire government received money and arms from the French government. Angola supported rebels who were fighting against the government. Coded civil war link because this is connected to a civil war in Zaire, outside this dyad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES:

CIVWARLINK: MID3012 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3012 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3012 from Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016), a Moroccan force with French soldiers embedded supported Zairean troops fighting against rebels from Angola. There was an ongoing civil war in Zaire at the time. Coded civil war link because the civil war in Zaire, outside of this dyad, contributed to this MID. Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped, as no Angolan military forces were involved and the clash between French soldiers and Angolan rebels does not constitute a MID between France and Angola.
