PS-UPDATE2020:

PSNOTES: BOTH JOIN EU ON JANUARY 1, 2007.

Romania joined the Second Balkan War on July 10, 1913 and invaded Bulgaria. The territories of Dobrudja was disputed between the two countries all throughout the inter-war period + heavy discrimination against and killing of Bulgarian ethnics in Southern Dobrudja and Caliacra county (now part of Bulgaria). The territory of Caliacra was finally solved with WWII and its return to Bulgaria.

September 9, 1945 - new pro-Soviet/Communist government in place in Bulgaria. Romania had this change on August 23, 1944.

With no territorial disputes and joint Communist/NATO/EU membership paths it makes sense to have the relationships at 0.25 since 1945 until 20069999.
