NARRATIVE-CR:
The Cuba-Germany rivalry is one of many Latin American rivalries with the Axis powers during the second World War. From 1941 to 1943 four mids between the two countries occured, leading to the rivalry classification. These mids are the results of Cuban efforts to eliminate German subversion activities on the island, mostly involving arrests and internments of German citizens during the state of war declared by Cuba on Germany in December 1941 (MID3513 on 12/9/1941, MID3525 on 12/7/1941). These efforts by Cuba led to German U-boat threats to shell the island (MID3881 on 1/1/1942). The rivalry is concluded with the German defeat in 1945 and the end of the second World War.
