CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to help the rebels against the government, and Zaire suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba for doing so in April 1977. Angola also wanted the rebels to succeed, had been providing rebels with refuge, and warned other countries not to interfere in the civil war or it would respond militarily. From Gibler 2018, Morocco was among several countries to offer support to Zaire during the war, putting Morocco on the opposite side of Angola in this MID. Coded civil war link because this was connected to the civil war in Zaire/DRC, outside this dyad. Coded uncertain because it is unclear from cm narrative, Gibler 2018, and news coverage of this MID how Uganda is involved. Gibler 2018 also has Uganda and Morocco on the same side in this MID.
