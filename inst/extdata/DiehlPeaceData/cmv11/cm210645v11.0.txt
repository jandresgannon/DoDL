Coded third party link to territorial MID because the Iraq invasion of Kuwait was a territorial MID, and Netherlands intervened in the territorial dispute. MARITMID: MID3957 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certainMARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID3957 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certainISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID3957 3 -- not civil war CIVWARMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certainCIVWARMID-NOTES:CIVWARLINK: MID3957 3 -- not civil war linkCIVWARLINK-CER: MID3957 1 -- certainCIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID3957 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID3957 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID4273 TERRMID: MID4273 3 -- not territory TERRMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain TERRMID-NOTES: TERRLINK: MID4273 3 -- not third party link to territory TERRLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4273 is the US/coalition invasion of Iraq, and it featured some clashes along the Kuwait-Iraq border which was disputed, but this was not connected to the territorial dispute and was instead connected to the US/coalition (including Netherlands) invasion of Iraq. MARITMID: MID4273 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID4273 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID4273 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4273 from Gibler (2018), this is the leadup and beginning of the US/coalition invasion and occupation of Iraq. The US, UK, and other coalition forces (including Netherlands) were attempting to coerce Iraq into complying with weapons inspections. Iraq also threatened the planes enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq, who were keeping Iraq from attacking rebel groups within its borders. Coded civil war MID because this involved threats by Iraq to coalition forces involved in preventing civil war activity between the regime and rebel groups in Iraq. CIVWARLINK: MID4273 3 -- not civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID4273 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID4273 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID4 2002-2010:MID4273rivalry=210645 nationa=NETHERLANDS nationb=IRAQ MID4273 20030302-20030318  revtype1a=POLICY revtype2a=REGIME/GOVERNMENT fatala=NONE fatalpa=0 lhosta=DISPLAY OF FORCE  revtype1b=POLICY revtype2b=NOT APPLICABLE fatalb=> 999 DEATHS fatalpb=.lhostb=WAR Over the course of 2002, US and UK planes bombed various Iraqi defense systems placed either in or near the US-imposed no-fly zones. During this time Iraq deployed ground forces to its border towns in a preemptive move against future US aggression. Beginning in March 2003, the US began deploying additional land, naval, and air forces to the the Middle East in a clear show of force and build-up to a future invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, just prior to the US-led invasion, several Middle Eastern countries deployed small numbers of troops to Kuwait in a symbolic show of defense for the neighbor of Iraq, which had been the historical target of Iraqi aggression. Later in March 2003, a US-led coalition, seeking to oust the regime of Saddam Hussein and dismantle alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, invaded Iraq and engaged in major combat operations, ultimately resulting in war, against the country that lasted until May 1, 2003. First day of dispute is listed on 3/2/2003 and last day of dispute is listed on 3/18/2003. MID3 1993-2001:NOTE THAT THE NETHERLANDS WAS INVOLVED BRIEFLY AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES IN THIS SAME DISPUTE Ð MID4273.

Iraq increased the frequency with which it violated the no-fly zones and threatened to refuse to allow Americans on the UN inspections team. Most importantly, Iraq threatened to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane. The United States and the United Kingdom responded by threatening military action if Iraq attempted to shoot down an American plane. Kuwait responded to the heightened tension between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq by putting its troops on alert. On 11/13/1997, Iraq carried out its threat to expel US Arms inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom began preparing for punitive air strikes against Iraq if Iraq did not begin to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. On 11/23/1997, Iraq allowed weapons inspectors to reenter, but it continued to hamper UN investigations, restricting access to selected sites. On 1/17/1998, Iraq again threatened to expel weapons inspectors, requesting that economic sanctions against it be lifted. The United States reiterated its threat to use force if Iraq did not allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected sites. The US and UK military buildup in the region continued and they announced that their forces were combat ready (2/7/1998). In MIDNovember, the United States reissued its threat to use force against Iraq if it did not unconditionally comply with UN weapons inspectors. All remaining weapons inspectors withdrew in response to the United States' warning. Iraq capitulated on 11/15/1998, promising to comply with the UN inspection teams. The United States and the United Kingdom stated that if Iraq did not continue to comply, they would use force against it. On 12/10, Iraq ended cooperation with UN inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would attack Iraq without warning for breaking it promise of full cooperation. On 11/16, they began "Operation Desert Fox," a four-day bombing campaign against Iraq. Israel also put its military on alert, fearing that Iraq would attack it in retaliation for U.S. and British military actions against Iraq. Almost immediately after the American and British bombing campaign, Iraq stated that it would challenge the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq (11/1998; 1/3/1999). There were clashes on almost a daily basis between British and American planes patrolling the northern and southern no-fly zones and Iraqi military installations from December 1998 to October 2001. Although clashes between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq occurred almost continuously until October, Iraqi challenges to the no-fly zones escalated in August 2001 and were more frequent until mid-October. On 2/15/1999, Iraq threatened to attack Turkey if it continued to allow American planes to use its bases. On 2/2/1999, the United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would retaliate if fired upon, by bombing pre-determined targets in Iraq that were deemed threatening. The United States and the United Kingdom engaged in numerous retaliatory bombing campaigns on Iraqi targets through October (2001), as Iraq continued to threaten and fire upon American and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones. On 10/22/1999, 11 nations (USA, UK, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Greece, and Germany) participated in joint military exercises to demonstrate that an anti-Iraq coalition could still be formed. On 5/23/2001 and 8/24/2001, an Iraqi patrol crossed into Saudi territory and fired on a Saudi border patrol. Iraq acted in order to demonstrate its disapproval of Saudi aid to the United States. On 6/11/2001, Saudi Arabia seized a unused pipeline from Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi violations of Saudi borders. First and last day of dispute was on 10/22/1999.RIVNOTES: NARRATIVE-CM:SOURCES-CM:NARRATIVE-CR:MID4273 The dispute began (10/7/1997) because of increasing intransigence by Iraq.
