MID208 

TERRMID: MID208 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID208 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID208 occurred in March of 1953 and is a multilateral dispute with the US and the UK versus the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia sentenced a US reporter to prison for espionage. The US imposed economic sanctions, and Czechoslovakia shot down a US military aircraft over US-occupied Germany. The Soviets also shot down a UK bomber over Germany, prompting UK to fly armed planes over Czechoslovakia. Coded not territorial because the UK and Czechoslovakia did not have a territorial dispute, and this was a Cold War dispute. 

TERRLINK: MID208 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID208 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID208 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral dispute with the US and the UK versus the USSR and Czechoslovakia. The US and USSR were third parties to territorial disputes, including East Germany vs West Germany (GDR vs FRG). However, this MID is coded not third party link because although Czechoslovakia was a Soviet ally, this was not a MID about advancing a territorial claim involving E/W Germany or anywhere else. It was a Cold War dispute in which UK was pulled in by Soviet attacks and Czechoslovakia was pulled in when it arrested a US reporter, and when its airspace was violated in the UK response to the Soviets bombing a UK aircraft.

TERRLINK: MID27 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID27 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID27 is a multilateral MID involving Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, and the USSR versus the USA, the UK, France, and West Germany. This is the crisis that eventually led to the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Khrushchev gave an ultimatum for the US to leave West Berlin, which threatened the status of West Berlin. The USSR was concerned about the growing military power of West Germany and threatened to sign a peace treaty with East Germany, further threatening western interests. Coded third party link to territorial MID because West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) claimed the territory of East Germany (German Democratic Republic) as rightfully its own, and by extension, the US, UK, and France backed this claim. The USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Poland backed East Germany's position in the territorial dispute. The opposing support for the claims was linked to this dispute.

RIVNOTES: 

MID208 occurred in March of 1953. It is a multilateral dispute with the US and the UK versus the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia sentenced William Oatis, a press correspondent from the US, to a ten-year prison sentence for espionage on July 4, 1951. The US responded by imposing economic sanctions against Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovak military aircraft shot down a US military aircraft over the US occupation zone in Germany on March 10, 1953. Czechoslovakia released William Oatis from prison on May 15, 1953, and the US lifted economic sanctions against Czechoslovakia on May 16, 1953. 

MID27 is the Berlin Wall Crisis. This is a multilateral dispute involving many countries including the US in opposition to Czechoslovakia. The Berlin dispute had simmered ever since Khrushchev threatened (1958) to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. This action would seriously threaten the status of West Berlin, as well as Western access to the city.
