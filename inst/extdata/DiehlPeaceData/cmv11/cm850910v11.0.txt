NARRATIVE-CM:

NARRATIVE-CR:

The rivalry between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) is centered on the status of Irian Jaya currently the eastern most and largest province of the Indonesian archipelago. Irian Jaya is the Indonesian term for the eastern half of the island New Guinea. Papua New Guinea occupies the western half of the island. Papua is a term that refers to the indigenous inhabitants of the entire island. The island of New Guinea is rich in mineral resources. Irian Jaya has the world's richest proven gold mine which is operated by a US based firm, Freeport McMoRan also Indonesia's largest taxpayer. The island is also rich in timber and is larger than the United Kingdom land mass.

In 1949, Indonesia achieved independence from the Dutch after a four year war for independence. The Dutch however retained control of the Western half of New Guinea (Irian Jaya). In 1962 Indonesia went to war with the Dutch over control of Irian Jaya. The UN intervened and facilitated a resolution to the conflict which allowed for Indonesia to take possession of Irian Jaya on the condition that they implement a program of self determination by 1969. This was never implemented. Instead the Indonesian government selected pro-Indonesian tribal leaders to `vote' on whether they wanted to become integrated into Indonesia. They of course did vote for integration in what came to known as the Act of No Choice. An armed secessionist movement took shape in Irian Jaya by 1965 after it became clear to the ethnically Papuan inhabitants that Indonesia had no intention of granting them independence. The primary rebel group is called the Free Papua Movement (OPM). The rebels often operate from what was to become in 1975, PNG territory, where the local population provided them with sympathy and support.

Relations between Indonesia and PNG deteriorated in early 1982. By May Indonesian troops had begun crossing into PNG in pursuit of insurgents, provoking protest and troop buildups in the border area (MID3083). Indonesian military aircraft also infringed PNG airspace in pursuit of insurgents. 

In 1984 (MID3050) relations between the states remained hostile as Indonesian military forces (ABRI) continued to infringe the PNG border. The ABRI pursued insurgents into PNG territory and built a road to facilitate maneuvers on PNG territory. An additional source of tension at the time was heavy handed treatment of Irian Jaya Papuans causing thousands to seek refuge across the border in PNG. Additionally, Indonesia implemented forced resettlement programs moving inhabitants from more densely populated islands in Indonesia to the more sparsely populated Irian Jaya. This angered Irian Papuans fearing a threat from the Javanization or Asianization policies to their self described Pacific culture. This fueled OPM insurgency. 

In 1988 the ABRI raided a PNG village in the West Sepik Province near the border (MID2745). In the incident ABRI shots were fired and the ABRI took five PNG civilian hostages. This prompted PNG to lodge official protests with Indonesia calling the incursion a blatant violation of PNG's sovereignty. Again in 1990 (MID3961) ABRI units crossed into PNG territory pursuing OPM rebels prompting a firm protest by PNG. 

Indonesia feels that PNG could do more to maintain security of its border and views the PNG as providing a sanctuary for the fragmented OPM separatist group. Indonesia-PNG relations continue to be tense because of the inability-or inattention of the PNG to border security and OPM operations from their territory. Abdurrahaman Wahid promised autonomy for Irian Jaya but his successor, Megawati Sukarnoputri has not been as conciliatory with the West Papuan desire for autonomy/independence.

19750916-19820525 0.5

On June 8, 1979, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea signed an agreement on technical cooperation in Port Moresby following a meeting between President Suharto and Prime Minister Somare, "The Indonesia Times" reported. The agreement includes an exchange of advisors, experts, technicians and scholars, provision of practical training needed by the two countries for their development efforts, and other forms of technical cooperation which might be deemed necessary by both governments. This agreement shall be carried out on a joint financial basis, within the limits of each government's capability. The heads of the two governments also discussed plans for development of their border area. The two countries would cooperate in the fields of agriculture, light industries and fisheries.

Ebia Olewale, Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea, arrived in Jakarta on 16th December, 1979, to sign a border agreement and to have talks with Panggabean, Co-ordinating Minister for Politics and Security. On the 17th the border agreement replacing the one formerly concluded between Indonesia and Australia, was signed by Foreign Ministers Mochatar Kusumaatmaja and Ebia Olewale. The new agreement will give freedom to citizens of both countries along the border to visit each other without going through immigration procedures. Mochtar said that the conclusion of the agreement reflected the existence of good-neighborly relations between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Olewale said that the signing of the agreement was no mere formality but an indication of growing mutual understanding and friendship between the two nations. The basic agreement also reflected the desire of both government to develop the border region, he said. He added that navigation on the Fly river could now be regulated on the basis of the agreement.

Indonesia and Papua New Guinea as neighbors must promote co-operation in the sectors of commerce, tourism, culture, sport and education. An exchange of visits by officials of the two countries is an important step towards strengthening the relationship. These remarks were contained in a joint statement issued by the heads of government of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea in Jakarta on 13th December, 1980, at the end of the state visit to Indonesia by the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Julius Chan. On the subject of East Timor, Papua New Guinea declared that the question was entirely a domestic affair of Indonesia and that it would continue to support the Indonesian stand on the matter at the United Nations.

An Indonesia-Papua New Guinea maritime boundary agreement was signed in Jakarta on 13th December, 1980. The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, and Papua New Guinean Foreign Minister, Noel Levi. The agreement stipulates the continental shelf boundary and exclusive economic zone as well as the fishing zones on the border of Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea. The agreement also completes the 1971 seabed boundary agreement and its 1973 amendment.

Under a presidential decision dated 4th January 1982, a committee in charge for the settlement of the Indonesian-Papua New Guinean border problems has been set up with the Home Affairs Minister as chairman. The committee has the task of handling and solving border problems arising between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, based on the agreement concluded between the two countries in Jakarta on 17th December 1979 and approved by presidential decision No. 6 in 1980. The committee consists of 19 members, including the Minister of Defense and Security-Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, the Foreign Minister, the Irian Jaya Governor and the Commander of the 17th Cendrawasih military region.

19861008-19901029 Transition

After many years of rejection, Indonesia has succeeded in gaining approval from Papua New Guinea for a written agreement on dealing with emergencies on their common land border. The Prime Minister of PNG, Mr Paias Wingti, announced in a written statement on October 8, 1986, that his Cabinet had endorsed a draft memorandum of understanding on the issue. He said it would be finalized at a joint border committee meeting to be held in Bandung, Indonesia, from October 20 to 24, 1986. The agreement will allow prompt search and rescue operations when aircraft or vessels have accidents near the 760-kilometre border separating PNG from Indonesian-ruled Irian Jaya. Movement of authorities from both countries across the international boundary, after consultations, is provided for. In the past, PNG had been concerned that the proposed wording for an agreement to cover emergency situations was too vague. There were fears Indonesian security forces could interpret such an agreement as allowing "hot pursuit" operations into PNG against Irian Jayan independence activists. According to well-placed officials in Port Moresby, the memorandum of understanding specifically rules out hot pursuit. PNG and Indonesia are also planning to sign a wider treaty of "mutual respect and understanding" later this month.

On February 21, 1988, Papua New Guinea's [PNG] Defense Minister James L. Pokasui said that much can be learned from Indonesia. Joint war exercises and the training of PNG soldiers by Indonesian instructors may be undertaken in future military co-operation. The PNG Defense Minister said this in Jakarta after concluding a six-day visit to Indonesia. He said that Indonesia and Papua New Guinea may conduct and recommend joint war exercises and the exchange of instructors. Papua New Guinea has sent 11 armed forces officers to Indonesia to attend courses at staff schools.

Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have agreed to set up consular posts near their shared border to try to prevent future border incidents on November 7, 1988. PNG's Foreign Minister, Mr Michael Somare, said he and his Indonesian counterpart, Mr Ali Alatas, had agreed at a meeting that PNG could open an office in the Irian Jayan capital of Jayapura, while Indonesia could open a consulate in Vanimo just over the border. PNG and Indonesia exchanged terse diplomatic notes last month after an incursion into PNG by Indonesian troops in pursuit of alleged OPM (Free Papua Movement) guerillas, who are fighting for Irian Jayan independence from Indonesia. Mr Somare said he believed that in future such incursions would not occur. But Mr Alatas made it clear in a diplomatic note sent recently to Port Moresby that there was no guarantee there would be no more inadvertent incursions by Indonesian troops. Mr Somare flies to the North Sumatran capital of Medan for a ministerial meeting of the joint border committee.

In 1988 the ABRI raided a PNG village in the West Sepik Province near the border (MID2745). In the incident ABRI shots were fired and the ABRI took five PNG civilian hostages. This prompted PNG to lodge official protests with Indonesia calling the incursion a blatant violation of PNG's sovereignty. Again in 1990 (MID3961) ABRI units crossed into PNG territory pursuing OPM rebels prompting a firm protest by PNG. These MIDs have been minimal incidents after the signing of the 1986 treaty that regulated relationships between the two countries.

19901030-20159999 0.5

The last MID of RIV1373, MID3961 ended on October 29, 1990. The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Rabbie Namaliu, began a state visit to Indonesia on 13th January, 1992. President Suharto of Indonesia said that PNG could serve as a bridge linking ASEAN and Asia-Pacific countries, according to Minister-State Secretary Murdiono, who briefed reporters on the outcome of talks between President Suharto and Namaliu in Jakarta on 14th January 1992. Murdiono added that the leaders had discussed international, regional and bilateral issues. They shared similar views as developing countries which face similar challenges. It was also agreed ''that PNG will become an observer at the forthcoming ASEAN summit meeting in Singapore this month''. The PNG Prime Minister expressed an interest in Indonesia's aviation industry. ''As the PNG now has two [Indonesian-made] Cassa planes, Namaliu expressed his hope that Indonesia's Nusantara Aviation Industry would provide spare parts and maintenance services for the planes. In this connection, Murdiono pointed out that Indonesia had offered technical assistance to train PNG technicians for the maintenance and repair of Cassa aeroplanes.'' During the talks, ''Namaliu also informed President Suharto on PNG's wish to lease a transponder of Indonesia's Palapa satellite and build a ground station with relevant communications equipment produced in Indonesia''. A parallel meeting was held between Indonesian Defense Minister L.B. Murdani and his PNG counterpart Benais Sabumei. After the meeting, the two Defense Ministers signed the so-called Status of Forces Agreement. Namaliu said relations between his country and Indonesia had never been better. Namaliu, speaking in Jakarta at a banquet in his honor, hosted by Indonesian President Suharto, added that the 1986 bilateral treaty of mutual respect, friendship and co-operation had helped to develop the relationship between the two countries. President Suharto said he hoped Namaliu's visit would deepen the mutual understanding and trust that had developed between Jakarta and Port Moresby, the radio said.

On January 14, 1992, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea signed a defense cooperation agreement which fell short of providing for joint security operations along their troubled border, Papua New Guinea Defense Minister Benais Sabumei said. The agreement was signed by the visiting defense minister and his Indonesian counterpart, Benny Murdani, at a meeting held in parallel with talks between President Suharto and Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu. "This agreement ... sets the legal framework in which our two forces can work together," Sabumei said, and would allow cooperation in training and exchange of personnel. He said it would "be a constructive way of trying to alleviate the concerns of a lot of Papua New Guineans about Indonesia." A group fighting for the secession from Indonesia of the province of Irian Jaya which borders Papua New Guinea has been operating on both sides of the border and incursions by Indonesian troops in pursuit of rebels have been a source of tension in bilateral ties. However, Sabumei stressed that the agreement "is not directed at ... allowing us to do joint operations against any security problems along the border."

On July 13, 1993, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea have agreed on eight more delineation points along their common border. The Indonesian news agency, Antara, says the two sides have now agreed on a total of 52 delineation points for the border, which separates Indonesia's Irian Jaya Province from Papua New Guinea. Antara says an agreement setting out the new positions was signed at the end of a three-day meeting in the South Sumatran city of Palembang. The meeting was attended by 23 officials from Indonesia and 14 from Papua New Guinea. They've also agreed to set up light towers at the northern and southernmost points of the border to help sea navigation in the area and mark the border.

Indonesia and Papua New Guinea will set up a border crossing checkpoint to facilitate the flow of people between the two neighboring countries, Indonesia's immigration office said on August 5, 1997. The new checkpoint is to be built in the next fiscal year between Skou in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province and the adjoining town of Wotung in Papua New Guinea. ''The checkpoint in Skou will ease the border crossing by people of both countries with either the traditional crossing card or passport,'' Pranowo, director general of immigration, said in a statement. The area is about 3,700 kilometers (2,312 miles) east of Jakarta. Skou is the only official border crossing point for travelers using passports or visas. Indonesia occupies the western part and Papua New Guinea the eastern part of Guinea island. Their border stretches for about 720 kilometers (450 miles). Moh. Zaenal Hasan, chief of the immigration office in Jayapura, Irian Jaya's capital, said that so far relations between people on the two sides have been limited to some villages near the border where crossings are made using the traditional crossing card. A border liaison meeting between the two countries is to be held in Papua New Guinea's Port Moresby in September, Prawono's statement said.

Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate arrived in Jakarta on June 3, 1998, for a four-day state visit in a bid to enhance the bilateral relations between the two countries. Skate and his entourage received an official welcome from new President B.J. Habibie as they arrived at the state palace in downtown Jakarta. State secretariat minister Akbar Tanjung said the PNG guest was scheduled to held talks with Habibie on Thursday as well as the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin). Also on Thursday, Skate and his entourage are scheduled to visit the state-owned aircraft industry IPTN in the west Java capital of Bandung, and the state-run ship-making facilities PT PAL in Surabaya. Before leaving Indonesia on June 6, Skate was also expected to visit the industrialized Batam island, just south of Singapore. Skate is the first foreign head of state to visit Indonesia since Habibie took over as president on May 21 following the abrupt resignation of president Suharto.

Papua New Guinea and Indonesia signed a bilateral trade agreement on 15th September, 2000, which will provide the basis for the strengthening, promotion and expansion of trade between the two countries. Minister for National Planning and Implementation and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Moi Avei signed the agreement on behalf of Papua New Guinea, whilst the Indonesian minister for industry and trade, Luhut B. Pandjaitam, signed the agreement on behalf of his government. "This is a historic agreement which will pave the way for increased trade with the most populous and closest of our neighbors," Mr Avei said at the function. He noted that the agreement was timely as it served to formalize trade that has been taking place between the two countries for the past 25 years-since PNG gained independence. "This agreement will provide further impetus for increased cross-border trade, especially for the northern provinces of Papua New Guinea. It will also enhance the current government's decision to develop free trade zones in one of our border provinces with Indonesia," the minister said. Mr Avei said trade between PNG and Indonesia is currently in favor of the latter. In 1997, PNG exports to Indonesia were valued at 1.2m kina, while imports from Indonesia totaled 27.4m. In 1998 PNG exports to Indonesia increased to 26.1m kina and imports from Indonesia rose to 146.1m. Then in 1999, PNG exports to Indonesia rose to 44.7m whilst the value of PNG imports from Indonesia dropped to 99.2m. "The dramatic increase in PNG exports to Indonesia came about as a result of crude oil exports from Kutubu, Iagifu and the Gobe oilfields," Mr Avei said. He called on the private sector in PNG to take advantage of this trade agreement to export more to Indonesia.

Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy Minister Surjadi Sudirdja has stressed the importance of national defense cooperation between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, in the interests of security and stability in the region of their mutual border. Based on past experience, the two nations had agreed to work towards bilateral defense cooperation, said Surjadi at a meeting of the Indonesia-PNG joint border commission in Bandung on 11th October, 2000. Therefore, said Surjadi, Indonesia and PNG could conduct joint military exercises in the border areas, using their respective military equipment. Meanwhile, PNG Provincial Affairs and Local Government Minister Iairo Lasaro, who led the PNG delegation, stressed the importance of Indonesia-PNG cooperation on border issues, with the aim of giving a sense of security to the populations of the two countries, particularly in the border areas.

Indonesia's ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Johannes Djopari, officially presented his credentials to the Governor General Sir Silas Atopare at Government House on November 28, 2002. The Papua New Guinea Defense Force and a band from the Royal PNG Constabulary received him with a guard of honor. During his presentation, Ambassador Djopari, from Manokwari in West Papua also presented a letter of recall from his predecessor, Ambassador Benny Mandalika, who left the country in December 2000 leaving the Indonesia embassy in Port Moresby to be looked after by Indonesia's charge d'affaires. He also conveyed warmest greetings from Indonesia's President Megawati Soekarnoputri and her personal best wishes to the government and the people of PNG. In his letter, Ambassador Djopari highlighted the status of good cooperation between the two countries, expressing the Indonesian government's gratitude to PNG for recognizing Indonesia's integrity. But he said many matters needed to be explored for the benefit of the people of both countries. "As neighbors, PNG and Indonesia have a prospective chance to shift this on-going trilateral trade into direct and bilateral route," he said. "To materialize this idea, we are now giving priority to a search for the possibility of opening direct sea lines both on the Northern coast connecting Makassar and Jayapura in Indonesia to Vanimo, Wewak, Madang ad Lae and onto Southern Line covering Merauke to Daru and Port Moresby. "Such direct routes are also being explored for airlines." Both countries are now waiting for the completion of several agreements on insurance and land transportation, intelligence cooperation and the avoidance of double taxation between the two countries. Sir Silas said that the first inaugural meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission to be hosted by PNG in March next year would further boost their relations. He said the PNG government is satisfied with the current level of bilateral consultations between both countries but their relationship would be further enhanced through regular contacts between the leaders. "The level of trade and economic cooperation between our two countries has been insignificant and renewed efforts would need to be made to encourage trade and economic activities," Sir Silas said.

On February 6, 2003, the Papua New Guinea Defense Force says PNG will not hold joint border operations with Indonesia. Acting Defense Force commander Capt (Navy) Ur Tom said this when told that Indonesia's military chief Gen Endriartono Sutarto had said PNG and Indonesia had agreed to a joint operation against OPM Operasi Papua Merdeka-Free Papua Movement freedom fighters the day before. Gen Endriartono claimed Papua New Guinea officials had also agreed that a number of violent incidents in the border area were committed by the OPM fighters. A number of incidents happened at the border during the festive period. They include attacks on an official who was about to meet the Indonesian ambassador for Papua New Guinea at the Vanimo border, and also the wife and daughter of Papuan rights activists Joannis Rumbiak were shot at on the border. Papua New Guinea Defense Force sources said on 3 February, 2003, that the problems along the border were more serious than government officials think. They said the PNG government should show more sensitivity in dealing with the border issue. Capt Tom said "Under no circumstance is Papua New Guinea going to hold joint border operations with Indonesia.'' He said military officials sent to Jakarta to hold talks with Indonesian officials were also warned to avoid using the term "joint border" operations. Captain Tom said the Indonesians carry out security operations on their side of the border while Papua New Guinea security forces conduct their own operations on their side of the border which were called parallel operations. He said there was an understanding in place which states that each country conduct security patrols on their own side of the border. Capt Tom said PNG did not have any enemies and so there was no reason why there should be joint border operations. He said PNG's sovereignty was important and so under no circumstance was there to be a joint operation.

On February 28, 2003, it was announced that in order to counter the separatist movement in Papua, TNI Indonesian Armed Forces headquarters is cooperating with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) military on the West Papua (Irian Jaya) border. TNI is also conducting dialogues with neighboring countries in order to restrict the movement of the group. "We are working with PNG to pursue them, because many Papuan separatists have fled to the border region," said TNI Commander, Gen Endriartono Sutarto, during a press conference at TNI headquarters in Cilangkap, East Jakarta. According to Sutarto, TNI's stance and commitment was the same towards other regions in Indonesia, that no regions at all would be given independence. "Therefore, we will not tolerate those in Papua trying to split from the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia, including the non-governmental organizations who are aiding them," he emphasized. "PNG troops have pursed those who have fled to their territory and Indonesia has pursed them in Indonesian territory (Papua, ed). However, we need mutual cooperation. Hopefully this will be effective so there is no more disruption to security," explained Sutarto. In addition, Sutarto continued, Indonesia was also conducting diplomatic discussions with other neighboring countries. Indonesia had requested that countries where separatists had been found, take measures and restrict their freedom of movement. Sutarto explained that TNI had obtained documents from the PNG government concerning groups wanting independence from Indonesia. These groups would use a number of issues to gain Papuan independence, for example, the issue of Human Rights and slurs on TNI.
