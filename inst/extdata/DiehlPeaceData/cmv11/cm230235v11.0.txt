RIVNOTES: 

MID210 was over Italian involvement in the Spanish Civil War. For Italy and Germany the Spanish Civil war was a chance to test out their new methods of Tank and Air warfare. France and Britain were concerned about the shifting balance of power into the Fascist state's favor. The conflict was resolved with the rise of the fascist state in Spain and the defeat of the Republican government in November of 1936 (www.onwar.com).
