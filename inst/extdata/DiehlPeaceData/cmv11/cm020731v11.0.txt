TERRLINK-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID51 from cm narrative, this MID is the Korean War. The US and UN forces fought along with the South Koreans, and China fought along with the North Koreans. North and South Korea were engaged in a territorial dispute in the Korean War, and UN's opposing support led them to fight North Korea directly, triggering this MID between them. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the territorial dispute in Korea led these countries to be involved in this MID.

TERRLINK-CER: MID4022 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4022 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID centering on a threat to Japan made by North Korea.

Coded not third party link to territory because while North and South Korea did have a territorial dispute, and North Korea violated the border with South Korea as part of this dispute, this dispute was actually connected to a threat made to Japan and the Western response to that threat. Was not connected to the territorial dispute itself.
