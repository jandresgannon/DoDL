MID1323

TERRMID: MID1323 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1323 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1323 from Gibler 2018, a disagreement over which African international economic organization Chad would belong to led to CAR closing its border with Chad as well as imposing tariffs in an attempt to coerce Chad into re-joining the organization that it had recently withdrawn from. This amounted to a blockade, triggering this MID. Coded not territory because no border disagreement drove this MID. It was an economic disagreement.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
The Central African Republic (CAR) closed its border with Chad on January 1, 1969 after Chad imposed customs duties on products from CAR. Chad accused the CAR of violating the border on January 10, 1969. President Mobutu of Congo-Kinshasa, who was visiting Chad, threatened the CAR with retaliation on January 10, 1969. The *Common African, Malagasy, and Mauritanian Organization* (*Organisation Commune Africaine et Malgache *- OCAM) mediated negotiations between representatives of Chad and the CAR. CAR re-opened its border with Chad in February 1969.
