NARRATIVE-CM:
Comoros and France disputed the sovereignty of the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean following the independence of Comoros from France on December 31, 1975. France held a referendum on Mayotte on February 8, 1976, and some 99 percent of the population voted to remain part of France. France had vetoed a *United Nations *(UN) Security Council resolution on February 6, 1976, which would have called on France to abandon the referendum on Mayotte. The UN General Assembly established a commission of inquiry to investigate the situation on Mayotte in June 1976. The UN General Assembly condemned France for holding the referendum and called for the withdrawal of France from Mayotte on October 21, 1976. *Organization of African Unity* (OAU) foreign ministers condemned France's occupation of Mayotte on July 18, 1978. The UN General Assembly expressed support for Comoros and appealed for negotiations between the countries on December 6, 1979. The UN General Assembly expressed support for Comoros on November 28, 1980. OAU foreign ministers expressed support for Comoros and appealed for peaceful negotiations on June 26, 1981. *Non-Aligned Movement* (NAM) heads of state expressed support for Comoros on March 12, 1983.
