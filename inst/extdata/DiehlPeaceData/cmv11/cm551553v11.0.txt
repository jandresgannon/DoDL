CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2589 from Gibler 2018, Malawi supported rebels in Mozambique who were fighting against the government. In 1986, the presidents of Zambia and Mozambique confronted the president of Malawi over its support for the rebels. The president of Mozambique also threatened to blockade Malawi if its support continued. Coded civil war MID because this is connected to Malawi's support of militarized rebels in Mozambique, outside this dyad.
