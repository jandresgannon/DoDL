PS-UPDATE2020: The coding change results from support of both states in rebel groups in the other state, specifically Angola's support of the Cobras in Congo-B. This is most evident for the onset of a lesser rivalry in 1997 when between 1,000-3,000 Angolan troops were flown in to support General Sassou Nguesso and his militia, the Cobras. The relationship returns to negative peace two years later, when a peace agreement was signed to end hostilities in the Congo (sometimes referred to as the Republic of the Congo Civil War, 1997-1999).
