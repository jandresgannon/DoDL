The Venezuela - Trinidad and Tobago fishing agreement expired in 1995. On October 30, 1996, the Venezuelan coast guard shot at a Trinidad and Tobago fishing boat (Hannah) in the Columbus Channel. Trinidadian fisherman claimed that Venezuelans rammed and fired at their ship. Venezuela, on the other hand, claimed that Trinidadian fishermen initiated the fire and rammed into their ship. The two countries exchanged protest letters on October 31, 1996. These letters led to talks between representatives on November 7, 1996. First and last day of dispute was on 10/30/1996.

The maritime border in the Gulf of Paria, which had been established between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago in 1990, experienced rising tensions in midApril 1997, based on specific disagreements over fishing and oil exploration rights. Venezuela claimed that Trinidad and Tobago's state oil company and Texaco were conducting illegal exploratory drilling in Venezuelan waters. They sent troops on an armed vessel to board the drilling platform and a tugboat. Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister warned Venezuela that the situation was "heading into very deep waters." This incident was followed by multiple cases where Venezuelans fired at, arrested, jailed, or fined crews and captains of Trinidadian fishing boats. Trinidad and Tobago authorities encouraged negotiations to reduce the tension between two countries, with the government raising the issue before the OAS, and increased coast guard patrols in Trinidadian waters. Nonetheless, Venezuela kept warning that they would continue to preserve their integrity and sovereignty. The seized TRI fishermen were released from Venzuelean prisons on May 28. By earlyAugust 1997, the relations between two countries were back to normal as a result of meetings between authorities. First day of dispute was on 4/00/1997 and last day of dispute was on 5/28/1997.

The maritime border dispute between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago flared during early August 1999, when the Venezuelan National Guard boarded a Trinidad and Tobago fishing boat. They also arrested two fishermen and sent them to Caracas. The Trinidad and Tobago coast guard claimed that Venezuelan officials threw the captain of the fishing boat overboard, hands and legs bound. Trinidad and Tobago officials claimed that the area where the incident took place was open to fishermen from both countries since an agreement signed in 1998. Trinidad and Tobago officials sent a letter of protest to Venezuelan Foreign Ministry and a Foreign Ministry official to assist the two fishermen whp had been taken to Caracas. First day of dispute was on 8/8/1999 and last day of dispute was on 8/00/1999.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry with Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela involves maritime rights in the Gulf of Peria. This area is rich in shrimp and oil reserves which are being used by fishermen and the oil industries of both countries. Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela had maintained a fishing agreement for the area but the agreement expired in 1995. The two countries began negotiations on a new fishing agreement but this came to a halt with an outbreak of conflict in October, 1996.

On October 30, 1996 a Venezuelan coast guard ship fired upon a Trinidadian fishing vessel, wounding one fisherman MID4149. Venezuela filed a protest with the Trinidad and Tobago government, claiming that the fishing vessel fired upon the coast guard ship. Trinidad and Tobago responded with a protest against Venezuelan government vessels using force against the fishermen. The Trinidadian Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj requested Venezuela resume talks on a fishing agreement between the two countries. The two countries have an established mixed commission that investigates and attempts to prevent fishing incidents. The commission met on November 7, 1996 to discuss the matter. No significant resolution was reached. 

On April 22, 1997 a Venezuelan national guard vessel attacked and sunk a Trinidadian fishing boat off the coast of Icacos, MID4154. Additionally during this period, the Venezuelan national guard boarded a Trinidadian oil platform and halted a Trinidadian tug claimed to have been involved in drug operations. On May 6, 1997 the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in an effort to resolve conflicts related to fishing activities. On May 19, 1997 the two countries signed a new fishing agreement valid for two years. Despite the agreement, the dispute continued with the Venezuelan national guard firing upon a Trinidadian vessel while seizing six others. This incident forced Trinidad and Tobago to take the dispute to the Organization of American States on June 17, 1997. In 1998, the two countries signed an agreement allowing fishermen from both countries to fish in the disputed area. 

On August 8, 1999 Venezuela arrested two Trinidadian fishermen off the coast of Trinidad, MID4155. On August 25, 1999 Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago held talks among three bilateral commissions to discuss the fishing dispute and the delimitation of the maritime boundaries.

While it appears that these commissions have had some degree of success, it is difficult to determine whether or not further conflicts are likely in the area. The two countries have been working together in the oil industry and this has helped to normalize relations somewhat. Given the domestic crisis in Venezuela over the last two years with the Chavez regime, however, it seems possible that the dispute could flare up at some point in the future. This is particularly true given the fact that the fishing agreements reached seem to be ineffective in stopping border incursions by fishermen, particularly Trinidadian, as well as the subsequent response by the Venezuelan national and/or coast guard.

Immediately after the independence of Trinidad-Tobago on August 31, 1962, the relations between the two countries were cordial. However, within a year, a dispute developed over the 30% tax Venezuela had placed on imports from Trinidad-Tobago, which was supposed to be dropped. Another issue of dispute developed over fishing rights in the Gulf of Paria. In numerous occasions Trinidadian fishermen were arrested for crossing the territorial borders to Venezuela and reports of maltreatment by the Venezuela authorities were filled. On December 15, 1965, Venezuela dropped the 30% on imports from Trinidad-Tobago and the path to closer relations was open. During 1966, the two countries initiated a series of positive contacts to negotiate economic, technical and cultural cooperation. From 1966 to 1967 Venezuela suggested and strongly supported the membership of Trinidad-Tobago in the Organization of American States, which happened on February 23, 1967.
In November 1967 a mixed Trinidadian-Venezuelan commission was created to study: 1) their common stances in international organizations and mechanisms to coordinate them; 2) cooperation in the fields of trade and political economy; 3) cooperation in the field of agriculture; 4) cooperation regarding oil, oil fields and petro-chemical industry; 5) education and culture. In 1970, during his visit to Caracas, Prime-Minister Williams discussed with his Venezuelan counter-part the possibility of organizing joint industrial ventures between their countries. In 1970 the good offices of the Trinidadian Prime-Minister helped forge an agreement over the border dispute between Venezuela and Guyana. 
The issue of fishing in the Golf of Paria continued to fuel tensions. In the first half of the 1970s, the Venezuelan president solved this issue by allowing the Trinidadian fleet to fish in Venezuelan territorial waters with the condition that the fish caught will be sold on the Venezuelan market. This policy, which allowed for very close relations between the two countries was terminated in 1974 when the tensions over fishing rights re-appeared. During the violent riots of April 1970 that took place in Trinidad, the Venezuelan government limited its influence to 3rd party mediation efforts and a small help, in terms of non-lethal weapons, to Prime-Minister Williams' government. However, in 1975, Prime-Minister Williams adopted a strong rhetoric against Venezuela accusing it of trying to "re-colonize" the Caribbean area and to aspire to regional hegemony.

On August 25, 1999 Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago held talks among three bilateral commissions to discuss the fishing dispute and the delimitation of the maritime boundaries. Venezuela's decision of 1999 to include Caribbean Community (Caricom) members in a scheme offering subsidized oil to a number of Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean states has irritated the government of Trinidad-Tobago as the state-run oil company, the Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago (Petrotin), stands to lose profitable supply contracts as a result. However, the trade relations between the two countries are high, with Venezuela being the second largest import partner for Trinidad-Tobago. The two countries have been negotiating for 5 years an agreement on the joint development of cross-border offshore gas fields. However, this could be complicated by Venezuela's PetroCaribe initiative, launched in mid-2005, which will cause most Caricom energy importers to switch from Trinidad and Tobago's state oil company, Petrotrin, as their primary source of supply for refinery products. In 2007 a joint venture, an aluminum smelter company, with capital from both governments was inaugurated in southern Trinidad. A framework agreement on the division and exploitation of cross-border gas fields was reached in 2007. A final treaty covering use of the gas has still to be negotiated. The border and fishing agreements signed by the two countries do not stop Trinidadian fishermen from entering Venezuela's territorial waters and the dispute could easily flare up all over again.
