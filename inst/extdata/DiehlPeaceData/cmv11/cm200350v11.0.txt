TERRLINK-NOTES: MID625 from Gibler (2018), this MID is connected to the Greco-Turkish War, which was being fought over territorial gains. The UK, France, and Italy warned Greece that there would be consequences if Greece marched on Constantinople, triggering this MID. Coded third party link because this was connected to a territorial war.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Some 87,000 Italian troops commanded by General Sebastiano Visconti-Prasca invaded Greece on October 28, 1940. Greek troops launched a counter-offensive against the Italians on November 22, 1940, and drove the invaders back to Albania by December 23, 1940. British *Royal Air Force* (RAF) planes and British Commonwealth troops (24,000 British troops, 17,000 Australian troops, and 17,000 New Zealand troops) intervened in support of the Greek troops. German troops intervened in support of the Italians on April 6, 1941, and Greece fell to Axis troops on April 27, 1941. Some 1,300 German soldiers and 13,500 Greek soldiers were killed in the conflict. The *National Liberation Army* (NLA)-which was established in December 1942 by the Greek communist organization *National Liberation Front (NLF)-initiated the insurgency after the withdrawal of German occupation troops. Some 75,000 British troops intervened in support of the Greek government beginning on December 4, 1944. The Greek government and NLA agreed to a ceasefire on January 15, 1945, and the parties signed the *Varkiza Agreement* on February 12, 1945. Some 237 British troops were killed in the conflict. Communist rebels led by General Markos Vaphiades resumed the rebellion in northern Greece on February 12, 1946. Britain informed the United States on February 21, 1947 that it would be unable to continue to provide economic and military assistance to the Greek government after March 31, 1947 (Britain had deployed some 14,000 soldiers and 1,380 military advisors in Greece).

NARRATIVE-CR:
Don Pacifico, who was a Moorish Jew and a British subject, "held large claims against the Greek government which he pressed with vigor until an anti-Semetic mob burned his house in Athens (1849, Dec)" (Langer, 662). Palmerston ordered the British navy to force a settlement of this claim and others held by British citizens against the Greek government. English vessels embargoed all Greek vessels in Pireaus (the largest port in Greece) and seized them in January of 1850. The French tried to mediate the dispute, but Palmerston refused (Taylor 35). By 26 April 1850, the Greek government was forced to comply with the British demands and the blockade ended.

As tensions between Turkey and Russia developed in 1854, the Greeks saw an opening to press Turkey. The British and French did not want Greece acting against Turkey and thus they blockaded Pireaus on January of 1854. (Note that Langer claims that the blockade lasts until Feb 1857, while the MID termination date is Dec 1854). This set the stage for future interventions by the European powers, as a concern with the health of Turkey dominated the machinations of the Great powers in Greek affairs.

The three remaining nineteenth century disputes between the Great powers (all of them save France) and Greece all involved the relations between Greece, Turkey, and the rest of the Balkans. When Turkey experienced conflict with Russia, or when civil unrest occurred in the Balkans, Greece and Turkey usually found themselves at odds and Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy, and Austria sought to protect their interests in the region by restraining Greece. Russia and Austria were usually more enthusiastic about military sanctions; the British typically preferred to try a diplomatic approach, and the Italians and Germans were most concerned about maintaining their status as new great powers.

The first of these disputes arose from the Bulgarian crisis. Russian administration of Bulgaria was poorly executed; the political divides in the Russian government played out in Bulgaria. The Russian diplomatic corps backed the conservatives, while the Russian military backed the liberals. This split left Bulgaria with more independence than the typical nineteenth century client of a major power. In 1885, eastern Roumelia revolted from Ottoman rule and expressed its desire to join with Bulgaria. The Great Powers considered how this would affect the future of Turkey and therefore Europe.

Russia, Austria, and Germany all supported the idea of Turkish reclamation of eastern Roumelia, in spite of the fact that it would reverse the gains made by Bulgaria, a client of Russia. Britain opposed this action by the League of the Three Emperors. Turkish reoccupation of eastern Roumelia was not the issue that concerned the English; Britain was concerned with the apparent weakness of Turkey, as Turkey appealed to the other Great Powers for assistance rather than acting on its own to reestablish control in eastern Roumelia. 

Greece saw an opportunity to move against Turkey by supporting eastern Roumelia, however the Great Powers demanded that Greece stay out of the brewing conflict. When Greece refused, Britain, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Russia all assisted in blockading Greece from 10 May to 7 June 1886 to force Greece to remain outside of the dispute. The Great Powers would not allow a smaller state to interfere with their interest in stabilizing Turkey.

Great Power control over other Balkan states was less successful in limiting hostilities. The crisis worsened when Serbia demanded compensation for the Bulgarian gain in eastern Roumelia. This led to a November war between the two that lasted for two weeks and ended in a Serbian defeat. The Great powers largely avoided the conflict as Bulgaria was a client of Russia and Serbia was a client of Austria. Austria did restrain Bulgaria from harming Serbia beyond the battlefield defeat, but did not move against Bulgaria directly. The League of Three Emperors survived the unrest and ultimately formed a compromise that allowed Bulgaria to maintain its new territory.

The Great Powers were again involved in a conflict with Greece in the Cretean Revolution in May of 1896. In February of 1896, an insurrection in Crete (against Turkish rule) flared up again, which was fomented by Greeks who desired unification. In early July, the Great Powers persuaded the Sultan to restore the Pact of Halepa (of 1878), which had given substantial autonomy to Crete, but had been largely revoked after unrest in 1889 was met by repression by the Sultan. The restoration of Halepa was not sufficient to quell the unrest, and the rebels continued to fight.

With the failure of the first diplomatic bid, the Great Powers were split. Austria proposed a blockade of Crete on 25 July 1896, but Britain refused to endorse this move on 29 July. The Great Powers compromised and pressured the Sultan to accept an agreement that was penned by the ambassadors of the Powers. This plan established an elaborate government in Crete which gave Christians both the executive and a super majority in the legislature; this temporarily satisfied the rebels. 

On the second of February in 1897, the Cretean revolution began anew, again supported by Greece. Crete declared a union with Greece on 6 February, and public opinion essentially forced Greece to send vessels and soldiers to Crete. The Great Powers sympathized with Greece, but were afraid that Greece would move on to foment a revolution in Macedonia next, and that would not be acceptable. The Russian foreign minister Muraviev took the initiative and on 15 February suggested that the Powers hold the island and restrain Greece. Holding Crete was acceptable to Britain, but additional action against Greece did not enjoy British sanction. Thus, an Austrian-Russian proposal to blockade Pireaus was refused by Britain on 17 February. 

Diplomatic attempts to forge a solution continued, but on 18 March 1897, the powers, noting Greece's refusal of their 2 March offer of an independent Crete, decided to use force. They blockaded Crete. By April 17 war erupted between Greece and Turkey over Crete. Russia prevented Serbia and Bulgaria from joining the fight against Turkey, and cooperated with Austria to prevent tensions between their respective clients (Bulgaria and Serbia) from leading to hostilities between the powers. 

By early May, Greece appealed to the powers for assistance. A series of decisive defeats forced Greece to withdraw and accept any solution imposed upon them by the great powers. An armistice went into effect on 19 May, and a peace settlement was reached on 18 September 1897, with Turkey receiving only a small territorial gain and an indemnity from Greece. The fate of Crete remained unsettled until November of 1898 when the powers agreed to name Prince George of Greece as governer. (Langer 756-7, 788-9; Taylor 304-8)
