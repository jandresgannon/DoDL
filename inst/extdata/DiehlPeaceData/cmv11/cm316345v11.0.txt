In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 3/9/1999 and last day of dispute was on 3/20/1999.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat.

RIV831 begins on March 3, 1999 when the Czech Republic joins the already ongoing MID4137 as part of the NATO operation against Yugoslavia. The Czech Republic officially joins NATO on March 12, 1999. 

RIV831 ends on November 28, 2000 with the conclusion of MID4343.

All three MIDs associated with RIV831 are related to the NATO action against Yugoslavia. 

MID4137 In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy.

On January 1, 1993 Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolves into two states: Czech Republic and Slovakia. At this time, the Czech Republic enters the international system as an independent and sovereign state. The Czech Republic becomes a member of the United Nations on January 19, 1993. In 1992, Czech Republic peacekeeping troops are deployed to the former Yugoslavian state of Croatia as part of the United Nations Mission UNPROFOR. 

July 14, 1993: The Czech Republic adopts a series of laws that legally ban certain economic activities with the states of the former Yugoslavia. These laws codify within the Czech Republic the United Nations Security Council resolutions No. 787 (Nov. 1992) and No. 820 (April 1993), seeking to sanction the former Yugoslavian states in homes of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.

September 1994: Czech Foreign Minister Vondra visits Yugoslavia to tour the former states. Yugoslavian Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic expresses the belief that Yugoslavia has done all it should be doing to eliminate the conflict and political misunderstandings; further, that he believes the actions taken by his government should be rewarded with a lifting of sanctions. Czech Minister Vondra expressed support for Yugoslavian efforts but felt that much more needed to be done before sanctions could be lifted. Vondra also stated that his country would renew all forms of cooperation with Yugoslavia as soon as the sanctions were lifted.

December 1995: Czech Republic allows NATO troops as part of the IFOR operation in Yugoslavia to move across Czech territory. The Czech Republic was a critical link between German bases and Yugoslavia for the movement of supplies and troops. The Czech Parliament approved the action on December 8. 

February 28, 1996: United Nations votes to remove sanctions against Bosnian-Serbs as a reward for fulfilling obligations agreed to in the Dayton Peace accords.

March 1996: Czech Republic parliament votes to lift sanctions against Yugoslavia, thus endorsing the United Nations Security Council resolution following the Dayton Peace Accords.

December 1996: Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus stressed importance for the renewal of the former Yugoslavia's membership in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The membership was suspended when war broke out. Klaus expressed that renewal of membership was critical as the former Yugoslavia's participation in OSCE was necessary to built trust in the Balkans.

March 1998: Violence breaks out in Kosovo as Serbian forces crackdown on what they suspect are members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group pushing for the independence of Kosovo. The United Nations Security Council responded to the outbreak of hostilities by unanimously issuing an arms embargo against the former Republic of Yugoslavia.

October 1998: Czech Republic and Hungary publicly state a desire to receive the full security guarantee afforded to full NATO members. This statement was motivated by the possibility that NATO would intervene in Yugoslavia in response to the outbreak of hostilities between Yugoslavian forces and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. 

On March 9, 1999 the Czech Republic joins ongoing MID4137, the NATO action against the former Yugoslavia.

March 12, 1999: Czech Republic joins NATO and officially becomes a participant in the NATO action against the former Yugoslavia in Kosovo. 

The period from the Czech Republic's entry into the international system as an independent state on January 1, 1993 and their entry into the ongoing conflict against Yugoslavia in March 1999 is best characterized as negative peace (0.5). Although the Czech Republic cooperates with NATO and the UN in sanctioning the former Yugoslavia, relations between the two countries never threaten to turn hostile and they do not experience any militarized disputes. The two countries are in constant communications and Czech officials visit the former Yugoslavian states on several occasions. Czech officials express consistent support for the former Yugoslavia states and a desire to fully reengage as soon as UN sanctions are lifted. As soon as sanctions are lifted in 1996, Czech officials begin seeking stronger ties with the former Yugoslavia and offer public support for Yugoslavia's renewed participation in the OSCE. Relations do deteriorate with the outbreak of violence in Kosovo. The period of negative peace becomes one of rivalry (RIV831) once the Czech Republic joins ongoing MID4137 against the former Yugoslavia and becomes a member of NATO in March of 1999.

20011129-20159999 0.5

The last dispute of RIV831 ends on November 28, 2000 with the conclusion of MID4343. 

On April 1, 2001, Milosovic was arrested on charges of abuse of power and corruption. On June 28 he was extradited to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. His trial on charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia and Kosovo began at The Hague on February 12, 2002. On April 11, the Yugoslav parliament passed a law allowing extradition of all persons charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. In March 2002, the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to dissolve FRY in favour of a new, much weaker form of cooperation called "Serbia and Montenegro". By order of Yugoslav Federal Parliament on February 4, 2003, Yugoslavia ceased to exist. 

In the aftermath of the NATO action against Yugoslavia and the fall of the Milosovic regime, relations between the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia begin to normalize.

May 2001: Both countries agree to increase political dialog in the aftermath of the fall of the Milosoic regime.

June 2001: Czech Republic and Yugoslavian representatives discuss status the of Yugoslavian territory. Yugoslavia believes that Macedonia and Kosovo should remain a part of Yugoslavia. The two states agree to work toward more cooperative relations in the areas of trade, energy, and infrastructure. Trade between the two countries had already increased in 2001 by 30 percent since the end of the Kosovo conflict.

January 2002: The two countries sign an agreement regarding the movement of people between the two countries. They also sign a labor agreement regarding workers from each country working within the territory of the other country.

January 2002: Czech Prime Minister speaks out against the idea of Montenegro breaking away from Serbia, arguing that it could further destabilize the region. But, the Prime Minister stressed the need for autonomy for Kosovo.

February 2003: Czech Republic expresses support for for the integrity of Serbia-Montenegro and the integration of that state into the EU. The Czech Republic's stance is that Serbia-Montenegro had met all obligations for joining the Council of Europe, a prerequisite to EU membership. Czech Republic also expressed confidence in the stability of the Serbian-Montenegrin union.

April 2004: Czech Republic replaces troops stationed in Kosovo with a new battalion. The Czech Republic troop were stationed along the border between Kosovo and Serbia to help maintain the peace. 

February 2005: Czech Foreign Minister Cyril Svobada expresses a desire for the EU to put more pressure on Serbia to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal investigating war crimes committing by Yugoslavia. Cooperation with the tribunal is a condition for and the major obstacle for Serbian entry into the EU.

RIV831 is a product of the NATO action against Yugoslavia and, thus, concludes with the end of NATO operations against Yugoslavia in 2000. Post-Kosovo conflict relations between the two countries appear to be moving toward greater cooperation. The two countries sign a number of labor and economic agreements and the Czech Republic expresses publicly on a number of occasions support for Serbia's integration into the EU. Further, there do not appear to be any outstanding issues of contention between the two coutries. The relations after the end of the Kosovo conflict can best be characterized by negative peace (0.5).
