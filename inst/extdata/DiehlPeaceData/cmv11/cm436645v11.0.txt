TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3957 from Gibler 2018, this is the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the UN response to that invasion. Niger was part of the coalition that helped expel Hussein from Kuwait, pulling them into this MID. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a territorial dispute, as Iraq claimed all of Kuwait's territory as its own.
