TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4516 from cm narrative, this MID occurred when US arrested 11 Turkish soldiers who were allegedly planning to attack a Kurdish governor in northern Iraq. The soldiers were released to the Turkish military the next day. First day of dispute was on 7/5/2003 and the last day of dispute was on 7/6/2003. Coded not third party link to territory because although the US was occupying Iraq at the time, their dispute was one of political leadership/regime change and not a territorial one.
