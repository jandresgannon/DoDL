The military of Sierra Leone sent additional military units to its border with Liberia to prevent what it believed was Liberian support of militants in Sierra Leone and incursions by Liberian military units into Sierra Leone. Additionally, Sierra Leone captured about 50 Liberian soldiers in June 2002 that had entered Sierra Leone in an effort to raid villages close to the border for food and supplies. First day of dispute was on 1/27/2002 and last day of dispute was on 6/3/2002.

NARRATIVE-CM:

The rivalry between Liberia and Sierra Leone has two parts: 1991 and from 1999 to 2003. In 1991 there were military fights at the border, between Sierra Leone's military and the rebels under the leadership of Charles Taylor who was fighting a civil war against the Liberian state. Charles Taylor later ended up becoming the president of Liberia and the relations between the two states remained negative with Taylor providing support for Sierra Leone's rebel group, RUF, throughout the 1990s. The second major incident occurred in 1999. In 1999, the ECOMOG (ECOWAS peacekeepers) force commander accused Liberia of serving as a conduit for arms supply to rebels in Sierra Leone. Liberia was a strong supporter of the Sierra Leone's rebel groups throughout Sierra Leone's civil war (1991-2002). Sierra Leone's civil war ended on January 18, 2002. In 2003, Charles Taylor's regime was under attack from its own Liberians, and on August 11, 2003, the second Liberian civil war and Charles Taylor's regime ended. The turning point in the relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone was the visit made on November 7, 2003, by the interim Liberian president who apologized for the carnage produced by Liberian-backed rebels in the Sierra Leone civil war. 

Rebels loyal to Liberian guerrilla leader Charles Taylor crossed into Sierra Leone on March 24, 1991 and attacked two villages, killing 11 civilians and three soldiers, a government statement said. The attacks on the frontier villages of Bomaru and Sienga were denounced by the government as "unprovoked and wanton." Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia rebels have made incursions into Sierra Leone in the past to rob villagers of food.

The government statement on the attacks was issued after President Joseph Momoh held an emergency Cabinet meeting. The situation along the border is tense because Sierra Leone has sent troops as part of a West African military force that helped force a cease-fire in Liberia's 15-month-old civil war. Peace talks in the Liberian capital of Monrovia have been stalled by Taylor's refusal to attend. 

MID3978 started on March 31, 1991. On April 2, 1991, Sierra Leone said its troops, retaliating for a cross-border attack by Liberian guerrillas (on March 31, 1991), have invaded rebel-held territory in Liberia, raising fears that neighboring states would be drawn into the West African nation's civil war. The government of Sierra Leone sent an extra 150 troops to reinforce the 2,000 troops who were sent to the border to guard against rebel incursions in January, the BBC said. A battle between Sierra Leonean troops and fighters loyal to Charles Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, in Sierra Leone's southeastern Kailahun district left 19 rebels dead, the British Broadcasting Corp. said. A Sierra Leonean military spokesman said: ''Because of the continued attacks by NPFL rebels from Liberia, Sierra Leonean troops were now compelled to move into Lofa County inside (western) Liberia in a heavy offensive against NPFL rebels. Sierra Leone, battling an incursion by rebels from neighboring Liberia, has closed its air and sea links with the war-battered nation, officials said on April 16, 1991. Nigerian troops arrived in Sierra Leone to join a multinational force trying to repel the Liberian rebels loyal to guerrilla chief Charles Taylor. Guinea earlier sent troops as well. Sierra Leone President Joseph Momoh said the invaders seek to force him to withdraw from a six-nation peacekeeping force that was sent to Liberia to help end that country's 16-month-old civil war. The Liberian war has claimed more than 12,000 lives and sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the West African nation. The peacekeeping force has frustrated Taylor's efforts to take power in Liberia. Taylor denies responsibility for the Sierra Leone attacks. He claims Sierra Leone dissidents are attacking Momoh's security forces. U.S. and West African officials, however, say there is clear evidence linking the attacks to Taylor, whose forces control much of the Liberian hinterland, including the area bordering Sierra Leone. Authorities in Sierra Leone cut off roads into Liberia the previous week. But U.N. humanitarian flights of food and medicine had continued from Freetown into Monrovia. Aircraft of the Guinea and Gambian state airlines as well as a private company, Air Cargo Liberia, have been grounded at Monrovia's airfield. The last ferry from Monrovia to Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, left Liberia and was not expected to return. Air Cargo general manager Howard Meredith said immigration officials in Sierra Leone told him Liberians no longer would be allowed into Sierra Leone but that other nationals from Monrovia would be welcome. But an Air Cargo flight carrying British, Indian, Lebanese and Sierra Leone nationals was denied landing rights and was forced to return to Monrovia, he said. Meredith said one of his planes carried rival Liberian rebel leader Prince Johnson to Sierra Leone for a meeting with Momoh. 

Armed forces from neighboring Sierra Leone on September 5, 1991, launched an offensive into Liberia in pursuit of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebels, a NPFL spokesman said. Taylor's spokesman, Joseph Mulbah, told the BBC in a report monitored here that the NPFL was in control of the situation and was repelling the invading forces. Mulbah, speaking from Taylor's headquarters in Gbarnga in northern Liberia, told the BBC, "It's war." He was not able to estimate the strength of forces involved in the attack but said some 3,000 fighters had been training in Sierra Leone to invade Liberian territory. 

The government of Liberia has sharply reacted to January 22, 1999 announcement by the government of Sierra Leone to arm some 15,000 militiamen. At the Executive Mansion today, Dr Taylor described such attempts as a serious threat to the peace and security of Liberia as several dissidents who fled Liberia are now fighting alongside the Kamajors and Ecomog [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Sierra Leone's finance minister James Johah accussed Liberia of training and arming RUF rebels inside Sierra Leone's territory. 

MID4256 occurred from April 9, 1999 to October 1999. On April 14, the Liberian government is to send troops reinforcement to its border with Sierra Leone. Defence Minister Daniel Chea said government has ordered troops already at the border to be vigilant.Minister Chea said the troops reinforcement was in reaction to threats by Ecomog [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. Ecomog said it would strike at any route used to deliver arms to RUF [Revolutionary United Front] rebels. The Ecomog force commander has accused Liberia of serving as a conduit for arms supply to rebels in Sierra Leone. Maj-Gen Felix Mujakperu said arms were being supplied to the rebels from Burkina Faso through Liberia. Minister Chea said the allegations and threats against Liberia are unacceptable. He described the threats as irresponsible. Minister Chea said Ecomog should stop making accusations without proofs. He wants ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] authorities to prevail on the force commander to apologize to Liberia. Minister Chea restated that Liberians fighting in Sierra Leone are on their own. He said they have no support from the Liberian government. Minister Chea said Liberians fighting in Sierra Leone must be demobilized and sent back home. This dispute is about the military support Taylor's regime in Liberia gave rebels fighting the Sierra Leone government. 

Sierra Leone's chief rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, arrived in Monrovia on September 28, 1999, from Cote d'Ivoire to hold talks with the Liberian President Charles Taylor on the peace process in Sierra Leone. Taylor, speaking on his private FM radio station, said he will be meeting with Sankoh and later with former military junta leader, Johnny Paul Koroma, who arrived in Liberia five weeks ago. He said following the meeting with the "two Sierra Leoneans, and God willing, we will see them off to Freetown." Sierra Leoneans and the international community have been eagerly awaiting the arrival in Freetown of Sankoh and Koroma for the final implementation of the peace accord signed July to bring peace to that country. Taylor claims he has been fighting tooth and nail to make sure that the peace process in Sierra Leone remains on course, and added: "I think this is an honor for this country (Liberia) and this government to play such an important role in putting the final nail to the coffin of distress in Sierra Leone." Officials could not confirm whether Sankoh and Koroma will meet but Koroma had told reporters that one of the reasons for his prolonged stay was to "meet Sankoh to discuss genuine and lasting peace in our country." Koroma, who has had talks with Taylor, said that he was on a tour of the west African sub-region to make representation on the absence of his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council in the Lome peace arrangement. The junta which ousted the elected-government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in 1997 was nine months later booted out of power by the West African Intervention Force that restored Kabbah's presidency. The junta, which allied with Sankoh's rebel Revolutionary United Front, has demonstrated displeasure with the Lome peace accord by engaging in protests including hostage-taking. Sankoh launched his war in 1991 from Liberian territory then controlled by Taylor's rebel National Patriotic Front. Meanwhile, several callers on a local radio talk show Monday denounced the continued presence in Liberia of Koroma who, they said, must return home and help consolidate the peace process. Many hurled invectives at Koroma and called on the Liberian government to ensure that he leaves the country. Reacting to the callers comments, Taylor said he was distressed by some of the comments. "When Liberians get on the radio and start saying let this man or that man go home, this is not Liberian. This government is not going to be pushed into that position. Liberians have always been warn and accommodating," he said. "I want to set the record straight. Koroma is here upon the invitation of this government, with the knowledge of the international community, and may I add, with the consent of the Security Council of the UN. Johnny Paul just did not fall from the sky," he added.

On June 20th, 2000, calm prevails at the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia, despite media reports that both countries are amassing troops there. On March 20, 2001, the Sierra Leone's government reacted to the expulsion of its ambassador, Kemoh Salia Gbao from Liberia. Presidential Spokesman, Professor Septimus Kaikai said Taylor's behavior would not help in bringing peace to the Mano River Union countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The expulsion of Gbao has confirmed reports earlier published by this press that the Sierra Leone Embassy in Liberia was under constant verbal attacks from Taylor. The expulsion of the Ambassadors is likely to deepen the already frosty relationship between Liberia and her neighbors. Liberia has no Embassy in Sierra Leone and the National Unity Party leader, John Benjamin had maintained that government should not have one in Monrovia. On March 21, 2001, The Sierra Leonean government has given Liberian Charge d'Affaires to Sierra Leone seven days to leave the country, in retaliation for the expulsion of its diplomat from Liberia. The decision was made "with much dismay and regret about the decision of the government of Liberia to expel Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Liberia," and "in the light of the current unfriendly acts by the government of Liberia," the reports quoted a Sierra Leonean government statement published in Freetown as saying. On March 20th, Liberia closed the border with Sierra Leone following a sudden flare in tensions among the West African neighbors. MID4301 occurred in May 2001. In May 2001, Sierra Leone arrested 5 Liberian military officers after several months of diplomatic fighting. The relations between Sierra Leone and Liberia have been tense because of rebel activity along the border.
 This dispute is over the increased tensions between the two countries during March 2001 in which diplomats were expelled and the border was closed. 

The presidents of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone opened a summit in the Morrocan capital on February 27, 2002, to try to put an end to years of cross-border insurgencies between the three West African countries. Liberian President Charles Taylor and his counterparts Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Guinea's Lansana Conte rapidly agreed to the wording of a draft communique calling for an end to hostilities, Sierra Leone's Foreign Minister Ramadan Dumbuya said as the summit got underway. The summit in Rabat was being held as rebel forces, which Liberia claims are backed by Guinea, were reportedly closing in on the Liberian capital Monrovia.

All cross-border traffic from war-destroyed Liberia lacking official permission has been prohibited in a bid to keep destabilizing forces out of this newly peaceful West African nation, Sierra Leone officials said on August 11, 2003. Liberia's former President Charles Taylor-indicted on war crimes by a U.N.-backed court for his role in Sierra Leone's brutal decade-long civil war-ceded power to his vice president as rebels besiege Liberia's capital, pressing home a 3-year battle against Taylor. "We are not allowing anybody or vehicles to come from Liberia across the border into Sierra Leone without our permission because of the present situation in Liberia," Brig. Gen. Sam Mbomah of the Sierra Leone Army told reporters. West African civil conflicts frequently bleed across porous borders. Taylor himself is a former warlord accused of supporting insurgencies in Guinea and Sierra Leone. Notorious fighters from Sierra Leone's brutal 1991-2002 civil war have turned up recently in Liberia and Ivory Coast. A joint U.N.-Sierra Leone tribunal indicted Taylor on June 4, 2003, for trafficking with the Sierra Leone rebels and bearing "the greatest responsibility" in that conflict.

Sierra Leone became independent on April 27, 1961. Liberia was the only African state independent since 19th century, from July 26, 1847 when it gained independence from United States of America. In 1973 president Stevens and President William Tolbert of Liberia signed a treaty forming the Mano River Union to facilitate trade between Sierra Leone and Liberia-with Guinea joining in 1980 under President Sekou Toure. In 1975 Sierra Leone joined the Economic Community of West African States (commonly known as ECOWAS) and in 1980 the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was hosted in Freetown. 

Liberian president William Richard Tolbert paid an official visit to Sierra Leone on October 19, 1977. During the visit, President Tolbert and Sierra Leonean president Siaka Stevens signed a common external tariff of the member states of the Mano River Union (MUR), thus bringing the common external tariff within the union into effect. The two presidents also signed five new protocols to the Mano River Declaration on various aspects of cooperation, bringing the number of protocols to 18. Present on the signing ceremony on the Liberian side were several government ministers and deputy minister of foreign affairs; on the Sierra Leonean side were vice-president S. I. Koroma, prime minister C. A. Kamara-Taylor and some cabinet ministers. Diplomatic envoys of various countries to Sierra Leone were also present. After signing the common external tariff and protocols, both Tolbert and Stevens made speeches. In a joint communique issued by the two presidents said, "the heads of state re-emphasized the great significance of cooperation between the member states of the union in particular and Africa in general, and also pledged their absolute determination to promote economic cooperation within West Africa." They pointed out that the MUR would accelerate the development within the Economic Community of West African states.

The communique said, "the presidents also expressed satisfaction with the entry into force of the common external tariff within so short a period." they expressed the hope for a speedy implementation of the Mano River Basin development project and the Freetown-Monrovia highway project. "The presidents also reviewed the contemporary African and world issues in an atmosphere of mutual understanding," it said.

The Mano River Union between Sierra Leone and Liberia has been able to withstand effects of global economic problems thanks to the positive attitudes of both governments and peoples towards closer cooperation within the framework of the Organization of African Unity, pointed out Sierra Leonean president Siaka Stevens. He said this in a nation-wide broadcast speech marking the fifth anniversary of the union on October 4, 1978. Referring to the aims and objects of the union, he said that they are still to expand trade by eliminating artificial barriers, to create conditions favorable to the expansion of mutual productive capacity and to cooperate in the expansion of international trade. He said that all these achievements are the beginning of greater and sustained economic and social cooperation within the arrangement contemplated by the union. He pledged Sierra Leone's continued cooperation with the Liberian government to work steadfastly towards the high ideals of the union. The Liberian president William Tolbert said in a nationwide broadcast on October 4, 1978, that his country would pursue joint measures and policies with Sierra Leone to expand trade between the two countries and their industry within the framework of the Mano River Union. He was speaking on the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the signing of the Mano River Union Declaration. The union was set up to jointly exploit the resources of the river and strengthen cooperation between the two countries. President Tolbert listed the union's achievements since 1973 including the building of the Mano River Bridge, the signing and implementing of eighteen protocols and their annexes and the enforcement of research and training programs.

Liberian President Tolbert has urged Liberians not to permit the 17th November, 1979, football incident to disrupt their relations with Sierra Leone. He said Liberians and Sierra Leoneans must not allow hatred to emerge as the winner of the game and appealed to them not to miss the ball, and hit each other. He said he had followed editorials, commentaries and news stories by the press of those countries and appealed specially to the Liberian press to exercise good judgment and good taste in order not to inflame the century-old relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone claimed attacks on their nationals living in the other country because of this incident. When the two football teams met in Sierra Leone in November 1979, the game became a tinderbox and crowd trouble soon followed. The visiting ministers from Liberia were evacuated from the stadium. Later, the presidents of Liberia and Sierra Leone issued a joint communique asking for calm and peace. 

The Liberian Minister of Information, Cultural Affairs and Tourism has described as vicious and irresponsible a report by the British Broadcasting Corporation on its program of 26th November, 1979, in which it alleged that the Sierra Leone Embassy in Monrovia was attacked, stoned and its windows broken and that many Sierra Leoneans have fled Liberia. The BBC report also spoke of mass beating of Sierra Leoneans living in Liberia. The Information Minister views this report by the BBC as a malicious attempt to tarnish, misrepresent, undermine and bring into disrepute the image and character of the Liberian nation and people, who are internationally known to be hospitable, stable and mature people. We are not [word indistinct] to any behavior that would make African unity and peaceful coexistence. The Liberian Information Ministry wishes to state here categorically that no attack in any way has been made on the Embassy of the Republic of Sierra Leone, that no member of the Liberian delegation which went to Sierra Leone drew a pistol, that all Liberians cherish the Mano River Union, which has, over the past six years, further connected the already brotherly relations between the peoples of the two countries, and that there has been no wholesale sacking of Sierra Leoneans and no Sierra Leonean has been beaten or his residence vandalized-all accusations contained in the ill-research and astounding report of the BBC.

Sierra Leone's president Siaka Stevens and Liberia's president Master Sergent Samuel K. Doe met for the first time on 14th June, 1980, behind closed doors at Lungi, Sierra Leone. The talks, which lasted more than an hour, were believed to have focused on strained relations between the two countries in recent weeks. Over three weeks ago it was reported that Sierra Leone joined the Ivory Coast and Nigeria to stop Head of State Doe from attending the fifth ECOWAS summit in Lome, Togo. The Liberian Government reacted by recalling its Ambassador to Sierra Leone and the secretary general of the Mano River Union for consultations. The two diplomats travelled to Freetown with the presidential party but did not return home after the talks, and no reasons for their stay in Sierra Leone were given. Foreign Minister Baccus Matthews said the Government would issue a statement on the visit after the meeting of the Heads of State of the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in the Ivory Coast on 16th June, 1980. The Liberian Head of State has said in Sierra Leone that Liberia has no malice against any country and will continue to foster good relations with all peace-loving countries. Speaking to the Liberian community in Sierra Leone, Master Sgt Doe said Liberians are peace-loving people who are committed to building their country. On June 25, 1980, the Liberian Foreign Minister, Baccus Matthews made an official visit to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where he met with President Siaka Stevens. 

A direct telecommunications link between Liberia and Sierra Leone was formally commissioned on August 1, 1981 in Monrovia and Freetown. Liberian head of state Samuel k. Doe and Sierra Leone's President Siaka Stevens had a conversation and exchanged greetings over telephone at the commissioning ceremonies. In a statement, Mr. Doe said that "the event is a major achievement toward strengthening the friendship between Sierra Leone and Liberia and promoting the objectives of the Mano River Union." 

On 26th February 1983, the Guinean President, Ahmed Sekou Toure made a stopover in Monrovia, the capital of the Republic of Liberia, and in Freetown, the capital of the Republic of Sierra Leone. In the interests of the peoples of the Mano River Union, he extended an invitation to their Excellencies Samuel Kanyon Doe of Liberia and Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone to attend a tripartite summit in Conakry for the purpose of taking all necessary measures to settle the crisis which erupted between Sierra Leone and Liberia following the insult to the Liberian Head of State by a Sierra Leone newspaper. On 1st March 1983, HE President [sic] Samuel Kanyon Doe, accompanied by a strong delegation of the Liberian Government, arrived in Conakry on a working visit in response to the invitation of President Ahmed Sekou Toure, the Supreme Leader of the Revolution. The two parties-Liberia and Guinea-deplored the absence of President Siaka Stevens and held the planned working session on behalf of the three peoples of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. During the meeting, President Ahmed Sekou Toure, the Supreme Leader of the Revolution, who considers that the crisis between the Governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone and the resultant measures harm both the interests of the Liberian and Sierra Leonian peoples and the cohesion within the Mano River Union, pleaded with HE President Samuel Kanyon Doe and his delegation that the Liberian Head of State, his Government and the Liberian people, who have been insulted, would nevertheless agree to the sacrifice of cancelling all restrictive measures taken against Sierra Leone in retaliation for the insult. In response to the proposals put forward by President Ahmed Sekou Toure, HE President Samuel Kanyon Doe first made it a point categorically and indignantly to deny the intention attributed to him by the Sierra Leone Government to the effect that he wanted to annex part of Sierra Leone's territory. He stated that neither he nor his Government had ever had the intention of annexing any part of any country whatsoever. Showing deep understanding and in view of President Ahmed Sekou Toure's insistent appeal to leave no stone unturned in order to safeguard the spirit of brotherhood and co-operation between the two peoples of Sierra Leone and Liberia, President Samuel Kanyon Doe expressed his readiness to take into account the appeal made to him by President Ahmed Sekou Toure. HE Ahmed Sekou Toure therefore announced the decision to send a delegation, led by Prime Minister Lansana Beavogui, today, Tuesday, 1st March 1983, to meet HE President Siaka Stevens. He further promised to use his good offices to persuade the Sierra Leone Government to make official apologies to the Liberian people, their Government and their Head of State in view of the serious harm done to them. President Ahmed Sekou Toure thanked President Samuel Kanyon Doe for responding to his appeal to come together to find brotherly and friendly solutions to problems of common interest, which showed the openness of the Liberian side to dialogue. President Samuel Kanyon Doe commended President Ahmed Sekou Toure for his daily efforts aimed at establishing in our sub-region, and the Mano River Union an atmosphere of stability, peace and friendly consultations in the supreme interest of the brotherly peoples of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. 

On March 5, 1983, the government of Liberia has announced that while it remains open for discussion with the Government of Sierra Leone on the problems which arose from the 'Progress' newspaper article, its border with that country will remain closed. This decision was taken during a joint mission of the People's Redemption Council [PRC] and the Cabinet and was based on the unwillingness of Sierra Leone to manifest interest in amicably resolving the issue in the spirit of the Mano River Union. The newspaper had made allegations tending to defame the character of the Liberian leader by erroneously citing that he had personally shot and killed his wife, Nancy B. Doe. The indifference of the Sierra Leone Government with regard to the concern expressed in Monrovia has been viewed with surprise and dismay by the Government of Liberia. In the face of undue delay on the part of Sierra Leone to respond to Liberia's concern on the allegation, the Government ordered a closure of its borders with Sierra Leone and advised troops to effect that closure. The Government of Liberia has, therefore, deplored the allegation of Sierra Leone that Liberia is making claims to a portion of its territory. The Government says that Sierra Leone is attempting to confuse the issue of the newspaper article with the territorial issue. However, the Liberian leader has declared these contentions in Sierra Leone to be outright nonsense. He further said that had he wished to deploy troops into Sierra Leone, he would not have notified President Stevens of the troop movement nor announced the number involved. That alone, he noted, should have been sufficient to suggest to the Commander-in-Chief of Sierra Leone the absence of any hostile intentions on the part of the Government of Liberia. The Liberian leader said that earlier attempts by Liberia to engage Sierra Leone in a dialogue failed when that country made an offer to send a delegation to Monrovia but withdrew the offer after the Government of Liberia had consented to receive it. Equally, President Sekou Toure of Guinea had offered his good offices to effect reconciliation and renew harmony and good neighborliness between sister states of the Mano River Union. However, despite President Stevens' assurance that he would have attended the meeting in Conakry, he failed to do so. President Stevens equally rejected a recommendation from President Toure that Liberia and Sierra Leone should send delegations to the borders for a meeting. He said these actions were sufficient to prove Liberia's intention to resolve the issue in spite of Sierra Leone's reluctance to act favorably. Meanwhile, the Liberian leader had expressed appreciation to President Toure for his efforts and assured him that when the Government of Sierra Leone recognizes the magnitude of the act against Liberia and makes appropriate apologies, the Government will be prepared to consider the normalization of relations with the country.

''Devil forces'' who tried unsuccessfully to overthrow him, got transportation, training and arms from neighboring Sierra Leone, Liberian President Samuel Doe claimed. Monrovia's Radio Elwa, in a broadcast on November 17, 1985, reported Doe's claims and said one rebel said the leader of the coup, Thomas Quiwonkpa, promised to pay each rebel $100,000 and send them to the United States for training. Sierra Leone has denied involvement in the November 17, 1985 coup attempt. Doe claimed that the rebel troops had the support of the Sierra Leone's government. Liberia has recalled its ambassador to Sierra Leone for 'consultations' after accusations of Sierra Leonean involvement in November 17, 1985, failed coup, Liberian radio said. General Doe, the Liberian leader, said that land border with Sierra Leone would be permanently closed. He announced the recall of the ambassador and the Liberian secretary-general of the Mano River Union, a regional organization grouping Libera, Sierra Leone and Guinea, based in the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown. There has been no official reaction from Sierra Leone.

The head of state and president-elect of Liberia, Samuel Doe met the second vice-president of Sierra Leone A. B. Kamara in Monrovia on January 5, 1986. A. B. Kamara came to attend the inauguration ceremony for Samuel Doe as the first president of the second republic of Liberia. Kamara is the first senior government official of Sierra Leone to visit Liberia since the November 12 abortive coup led by the late commanding general Thamos Guiwonkpa. Liberia had accused Sierra Leone of being involved in the coup attempt after it was foiled and announced the closure of its borders with Sierra Leone. But the charges were denied by Sierra Leone. Earlier in December 1985, Liberia sent its foreign minister Ernest Eastman to Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, with a special message from Samuel Doe. According to Eastman, both Doe and President Josepj Momoh of Sierra Leone expressed their desire to cooperate with each other in the interest of good neighborliness. Local observers hold that Kamara's current visit here constitutes an effort by Sierra Leone to improve its relations with Liberia.

On September 13, 1986, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea signed a non-aggression pact in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, following months of dispute between Sierra Leone and Liberia during which Guinea tried to mediate the conflict between its two neighbors in the Mano River Union. 

On September 15 and 16th, 1988, Liberia and Sierra Leone announced that they reached a reconciliation agreement. In 1990 Sierra Leone hosted peace negotiations between Liberian rebels and the government of Liberia. During 1989-1991 Liberia was immersed in a civil war and there were no major skirmishes with Sierra Leone. The last MID of RIV1070, MID4301 occurred in May 2001. In May 2001, Sierra Leone arrested 5 Liberian military officers after several months of diplomatic fighting. The relations between Sierra Leone and Liberia have been tense because of rebel activity along the border.
 This dispute is over the increased tensions between the two countries during March 2001 in which diplomats were expelled and the border was closed.

The end of the Taylor regime in Liberia, on August 11, 2003, also meant a warming up of relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone. The turning point in their relations is the visit made on November 7, 2003, by the interim Liberian president who apologized for the carnage produced by Liberian-backed rebels in the Sierra Leone civil war. Liberian National Transition Government Chairman, Charles Bryant, who made a one-day state visit to Sierra Leone on November 7, 2003, apologized to the government and people of Sierra Leone for all the carnage meted out to them allegedly by the Taylor-led regime. The NTGL chairman also held closed door talks with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah aimed at improving Liberia-Sierra Leone relations. Chairman Bryant then donated 1,000 dollars to the Liberian refugees in that country. The NTGL chairman used the occasion to call on Liberian refugees in that country to begin preparations to come back home. Meanwhile, the government and people of Sierra Leone have welcomed and subsequently accepted the apology by Chairman Bryant and prayed for improved relations between the two countries. 

On May 20, 2004, the Mano River Union, an international organization grouping Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, long dormant due to the two civil wars in Liberia and the civil war in Sierra Leone, was reactivated by the presidents of the three countries.

Head of Liberia Task Force delegation to Sierra Leone, Dr. Moses Jarbo said on January 18, 2005, that about 242 Sierra Leoneans participated in Liberia's civil conflict. Dr. Jarbo, who was speaking during a bilateral meeting held at State House for the repartition of former Liberian fighters residing in Sierra Leone, says 45 of said Sierra Leonean combatants who participated in Liberia's war were women whilst 26 were child combatants. "The rest of the others are adult males and 99 of them have enrolled in training programs whilst others await registration into middle level man power courses of their choice," he said, adding that a number of other foreign fighters from countries within the sub-region were also recorded to have taken part in Liberia's conflict. Responding, Rtd. Brigadier Keillie Conteh told the Liberian Task Force delegation that government is not expecting any set of people from Liberia described claiming to be Sierra Leoneans who fought in Liberia's civil conflict. "If they were there, they fought for personal gains and for the country's interest," he stated. 

On July 18, 2005, Liberian Envoy Thomas Brima underscored the important relations that have existed between Liberia and Sierra Leone and apologizes for the strain in relations as a result of a protracted civil war in Sierra Leone involving some Liberians he referred to as "guided". Liberia's new Ambassador to Sierra Leone Thomas Brima has now presented his credentials to Sierra Leonean President Dr. Ahmed Tejan Kabba. According to an Information Ministry statement, the ceremony was held recently in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Presenting his Letters of Credence to the Sierra Leonean leader, the Liberian Ambassador said his tenure as ambassador signaled the dawn of a new day in fraternal relations between Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mr.Brima assured the Sierra Leonean President that the Liberian Government will promote the spirit of good neighborliness within the Mano River Union. Ambassador Brima indicated that the fundamental foreign policy objective of the Liberian Government regarding Sierra Leone shall be the cultivation of friendly ties and the settlement of disputes through dialogue and negotiations within the Mano River Union (MRU) framework. The Liberian envoy said the MRU will be used as a political conduit to revive the once vibrant sub-regional institutions-the maritime, forestry and telecommunications training institutes-which existed during the period of good relations before the civil wars in both countries. Ambassador Brima underscored the important relations that have existed between Liberia and Sierra Leone and apologized for the strain in relations as a result of a protracted civil war in Sierra Leone involving some Liberians he referred to as "guided".He urged the MRU citizens to begin positively using sources of the union. Liberia has had strained relations with its neighbor Sierra Leone for over a decade. These relations became worse in the early 1990s when reports of Liberia's alleged involvement in rebel activities against the government and people of Sierra Leone. It is alleged that rebels Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) assisted the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) of Foday Sankoh in its civil war against the government that lasted ten years.

Presently, exiled Liberian leader Charles Taylor has been indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal for Sierra Leone on 17 count for crimes against humanity and the people of Sierra Leone. He is in exile in Calabar, Nigeria.

On 17 March 2006, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the new democratically elected President of Liberia, submitted an official request to Nigeria for Taylor's extradition. This request was granted on 25 March, whereby Nigeria agreed to release Taylor to stand trial in the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Nigeria agreed only to release Taylor and not to extradite him, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries. The Nigerian government announced on 28 March that Taylor had disappeared from his residence in Calabar, Nigeria. On 29 March 2006, Taylor was arrested in Gamboru, along Nigeria's northeastern border with Cameroon. Nigerian authorities put him on a plane bound for Liberia and then handed him to the UN in Sierra Leone. On 30 March, the Special Court requested permission to use the premises of the International Criminal Court in The Hague to carry out Taylor's trial, although the Special Court will still conduct the proceedings of the trial. In Taylor's absence, the trial began on 4 June 2007. He pleaded not guilty. On 16 June 2006, the United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to allow Taylor to be sent to The Hague for trial; on 20 June 2006, Taylor was extradited and flown to Rotterdam Airport in the Netherlands. He was taken into custody in the UN war crimes tribunal's detention centre, located in the Scheveningen section of The Hague. The Association for the Legal Defense of Charles G. Taylor was established in June 2006 to assist in his legal defense.
