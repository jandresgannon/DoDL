MID1324

TERRMID: MID1324 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1324 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1324 Britain used economic threats to attack the minority government in Rhodesia, demanding that it cede power to a majority-backed government (i.e., Zimbabwe; Shepherd 1968). According to Gibler 2018, DRC, Somalia, and Madagascar all threatend Rhodesia with force if it did not comply with British demands. Britain itself only threatened economic sanctions, but the aforementioned countries explicitly threatened force on Britain's behalf. Coded not territory because this was not connected to a territorial dispute. This was a regime dispute.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1324 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1324 There is social discord at the time, but it does not appear that there is any civil conflict. Indeed, the British government may have wanted an internal uprising to assist them, but none seemed present (McKinnell 1969).
