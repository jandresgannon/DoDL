TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1269 from Gibler 2018, in 1919, Germany invaded Latvia to establish a protectorate there, with intentions of moving on into Estonia (Germany did invade Estonia but was pushed back by the Estonian army). The Allies eventually intervened and brokered an armistice between all parties. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the Allies intervened in a territorial dispute between Germany and Latvia & Estonia. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2017 does not recognize Poland as a party to this dispute.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1273 from Gibler 2018, the area of Upper Silesia was to have a plebiscite in 1921 to decide whether it should become part of Germany or Poland. Both Germany and Poland controlled the area at different points, and both Polish and German citizens populated the area. After Upper Silesia voted to become part of Germany, Poland attacked German troops to push them out of the area. Germany counterattacked. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a dispute over Upper Silesia.

The *Republic of Poland* was proclaimed in Warsaw on November 3, 1918. Poland severed diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia on December 9, 1918. Poland and Soviet Russia disputed their border beginning on February 14, 1919. Russia and Poland attempted to negotiate a resolution of dispute from June to December 1919. The *Allied Supreme Council (ASC), which consisted of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States, proposed the *Curzon Line *as Poland's eastern border with Soviet Russia on December 8, 1919. Poland and Soviet Russia agreed to a border (east of the *Curzon Line*) on January 28, 1920. The Soviet Union requested negotiations with Poland on January 29, 1920, and Poland conditionally agreed to negotiations on March 27, 1920 (Poland demanded the restoration of the 1772 border between the countries). Polish troops commanded by General Jozef Pilsudski attacked Soviet Russian troops in the Ukraine on April 25, 1920, and Polish troops captured Kiev on May 8, 1920. Soviet Russian troops recaptured Kiev on June 11, 1920. Poland requested military assistance from the ASC on July 10, 1920.

Polish workers rebelled against German administration in Upper Silesia beginning on August 17-18, 1919, but German troops suppressed the rebellion on August 23, 1919. The *Allied Supreme Council *(ASC), which consisted of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States, established a six-member commission of inquiry (Britain, France, Italy, US) on August 23, 1919. The ASC commission of inquiry mediated an agreement between German and Polish representatives on October 1, 1919, which provided for a general amnesty and the release of political prisoners in Upper Silesia. The *Allied Conference of Ambassadors* (ACA), which consisted of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States, established a three-member plebiscite commission (Britain, France, Italy) headed by General Henri Le Rond of France on January 10, 1920, and the ACA plebiscite commission arrived in the Upper Silesia region on February 11, 1920. The ACA deployed a peacekeeping force consisting of 15,500 troops from Britain, France and Italy on February 11, 1920. German police and Poles clashed in Upper Silesia on August 17-25, 1920. The ACA commission administered the plebiscite in the Upper Silesia on March 20, 1921, which resulted in a 60 percent majority in favor of German sovereignty over the disputed territory. Some 40,000 Poles led by Wojciech Korfanty rebelled against German troops in Upper Silesia beginning on May 3-4, 1921. The ACA mediated a cessation of military hostilities between German troops and Poles in Upper Silesia on June 24-25, 1921. The ASC referred the Upper Silesia dispute to the *League of Nations* (LON) Council on August 12, 1921. The LON Council established a commission of inquiry (Belgium, Brazil, China, Spain) on September 9, 1921.

The LON facilitated negotiations between German and Polish representatives concerning the Upper Silesia dispute in Geneva beginning on November 23, 1921. German and Polish representatives signed the *Geneva Convention* on May 15, 1922, which established an arbitration tribunal and a mixed commission to settled remaining issues. The ACA peacekeeping force was withdrawn from the Upper Silesia. Germany objected to the eviction of German settlers from Poland, and referred the matter to the Lon Council on November 8, 1921. The LON Council asked Poland to suspend the eviction of Germans from Poland on May 17, 1922, and Poland agreed to the request on May 18, 1922. The LON Council asked the *Permanent Court of International Justice* (PCIJ) for an advisory opinion on February 3, 1923. The PCIJ issued an advisory opinion on September 10, 1923, which suggested that the dispute was within its jurisdiction. On June 3, 1924, Poland proposed an agreement for compensating German settlers who could claim Polish nationality prior to July 14, 1920. The LON Council approved the Polish proposal on June 17, 1924. Poland seized a nitrate factory in Chorzow in Upper Silesia in July 1922, and announced its intention to expropriate several estates in Upper Silesia in December 1924.

Germany and Poland signed a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934. Germany claimed sovereignty over Danzig (Gdansk) in Poland and the Polish Corridor (territory linking Germany with East Prussia). Germany assured the Polish government that it would respect Poland's claim to the territories on January 13, 1938. On October 24, 1938, German proposed a new highway and rail lines under joint Polish-German control across the Polish Corridor to connect Germany and East Prussia. On October 31, 1938, Poland rejected the proposal, and suggested that it would resist any German attempt to annex Danzig and other Polish territories. On January 6, 1939, Adolf Hitler of Germany warned the Polish ambassador to Germany that Danzig must eventually be restored to Germany. Germany demanded from Poland the return of Danzig and the Polish Corridor on March 22, 1939. On March 31, 1939, Britain and France warned Germany that it would provide support to Poland in order to assure their sovereignty and independence. Germany abrogated the nonagression pact with Poland on April 28, 1939.
