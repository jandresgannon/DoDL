NARRATIVE-CM:
President Leon Mba was deposed in a coup led by Jean-Hilaire Aubame, leader of the opposition *Gabonese Democratic and Social Union* (UDSG), on February 17-18, 1964. The vice-president of Gabon requested French military intervention on February 18, 1964, and French troops were deployed in Gabon from Congo-Brazzaville (People's Republic of the Congo) and Senegal on February 18, 1964. French troops restored President Mba to power on February 20, 1964. The UDSG was banned, and French troops were withdrawn from the country in April 1964. Some 25 Gabonese and two French soldiers were killed during the coup attempt.
