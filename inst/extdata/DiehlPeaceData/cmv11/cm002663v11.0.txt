TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3957 from cm narrative, this is the Persian Gulf War. Iraq invaded Kuwait, claiming its territory as rightfully Iraq's, and was defeated and pushed back into Iraq by a coalition of 34 nations led by the US. Jordan supported Iraq during the invasion of Kuwait and protested what King Hussein called a Western attempt to re-organize the Middle East in its own favor (NYT 2/7/1991). Coded third party link because a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait led Jordan to be involved in this MID by supporting Iraq and opposing the US and other nations of the UN.
