DYAD: KENYA - ETHIOPIA
RIVALRY: RIV1123
DISPUTE(S): MID4188 

PSNOTES: 

There are a bunch more disputes, but minor and Ethiopia is likely clashing with cross border militants. Kenya doesn't seem to care with an exception or two and strengthening border security could be as much for rebels as it is for keeping Ethiopian soldiers out. we keep it at .5

CIVWARMID-CER: MID4346 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4346 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, Ethiopian forces crossed into Kenya in 2002 and occupied a school. They eventually left and crossed back into Ethiopia, but it was unclear why they crossed into Kenya and occupied the school. Cm narrative and Gibler 2018 do not mention a motivation. From Africa News 2/4/2002, a Kenyan official claimed that the Ethiopians probably had occupied the area due to "some internal problems of their own." This could be interpreted as pertaining to rebels, but no rebels are mentioned and we find no other mentions of this event in news coverage. Coded not civil war because the reason for the events of this MID are unknown and therefore cannot be clearly connected to civil conflict issues.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4369 from cm narrative, In July 2004, 8 Kenyans were killed by Ethiopian militiamen who had crossed over to raid Kenyan territory. In response, Kenya increased their border security to discourage further attacks from Ethiopian territory. In January 2005, another attack took place on Kenyan territory, as 20 armed Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border and attacked the village of Moyale in northern Kenya, killing a police officer. Again, in March 2005, several armed raiders crossed into Kenyan territory, killing a police officer and wounding four others. This event prompted the Kenyan military to again increase its border security. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Ethiopia attacking Kenya, within this dyad.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID4374 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4374 from cm narrative and Gibler 2018, Ethiopian forces crossed into Kenya and attacked a village in Kenya. From Africa News 3/9/2005, the Ethiopian forces were part of a pro-state militia that may have been attacking the village due to that militia, being of a different ethnicity than the villagers it attacked, claiming the land as theirs. This would therefore be a case of inter-communal violence. Kenya and Ethiopia did not dispute the area themselves (Huth and Allee 2002). Coded not civil war because there is no indication in the cm narrative, Gibler 2018, or news searches that this was connected to militarized rebel activity. If the attackers were indeed part of a pro-state militia, then they were not militarized rebels who were targeting their own regime or Kenya's.

After closing the border and sending troops to the border for unstated reasons, Ethiopian military forces occupied a secondary school along the Kenyan-Somali border. Kenya sent police forces to the school and, while no hostilities took place, the Ethiopian forces eventually relinquished control of the school and returned to Ethiopia. It remains unclear why the occupation of the Kenyan school occurred. First day of the dispute was on 1/23/2002 and the last day of the dispute was on 2/2/2002.

DISPLAY OF FORCE 

In January 2005, an attack took place on Kenyan territory, as 20 armed Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border and attacked the village of Moyale in northern Kenya, killing a police officer. A few months later, Kenya deployed additional troops to the Kenya-Ethiopia border to prevent such cross-border attacks. First day of dispute was on 1/18/2005 and last day of dispute was on 3/7/2005.

On April 24, 2006, about 60 Ethiopian soldiers crossed over the border into neighboring Kenya and attacked the border village of Somare, which was believed to be harboring OLF rebels. Reports claim that the soldiers abducted two individuals. A few days later, Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border in another attempt to attack the village of Somare. However, the soldiers were intercepted and ambushed by a detachment of Kenyan soldiers. The two groups of soldiers clashed and, while no Kenyan soldiers were killed, reports state that 'several' Ethiopian soldiers were killed, although no number was ever specified. First day of dispute was on 4/24/2006 and last day of dispute was on 4/27/2006.

Ethiopian forces attacked the Dambala Fuchana village, in northern Kenya on the border with Ethiopia apparently in pursuit of rebel Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militiamen who had killed over 30 Ethiopian troops in three previous days of fierce fighting. During the incident, on 16th January 1999, Ethiopian troops were in hot pursuit of OLF militiamen before Kenyan security personnel repulsed them. The Kenyan government lodged an official protest with the Ethiopian government following the incursion. The normally friendly governments met 5 months after the incident and issued a joint communiqu? «o step up border security and cooperation in the area. First and last day of the dispute was on 1/16/1996.
