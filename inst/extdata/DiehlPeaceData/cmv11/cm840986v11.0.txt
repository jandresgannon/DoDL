MARITMID-NOTES: MID4243 the maritime border remains to be fully delimited as of November 2016, meaning it was unsettled during MID4243. (as of 2008: “The Philippines is undergoing talks with Indonesia and Palau to settle the issue on sea border delineation and reach a treaty by the end of the year [2008].” - See more at: http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/108510/news/rp-talks-with-palau-indonesia-over-maritime-issues). From Gibler 2018, in 2000 Palau fired on several fishing vessels in the disputed waters, and Philippines protested because one of their citizens was on board.
