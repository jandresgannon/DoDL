TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from NYT 8/25/1922, Italy threatened possible war if Austria unified or allied with Germany or the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia), calling it a causus belli. Italy instead proposed Austria merge with Italy. Austria said that it was suffering from economic hardships, and that it had received loan pledges from several countries, and claimed that those pledges must be honored immediately or Austria may have to proceed with unification. UK was one of the pledging countries, but UK backed Italy's position in this dispute, pulling UK into this MID against Romania (as one of the Little Entente) here. Coded not territory because there was no advancement of territorial claims here. Italy was not claiming that any part of Austria's territory was rightfully its own, but was only offering annexation as a possible solution to the issue under dispute, a unified German state. Italy made a warfare threat to prevent Austrian unification or alliance with Germany or with Romania/Czechoslovakia/Yugoslavia, and UK backed Italy's position.
