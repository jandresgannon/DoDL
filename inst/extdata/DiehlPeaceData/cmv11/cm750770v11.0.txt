TERRMID-NOTES: MID2631 from Gibler 2018, by 1965 most of the border between India and West Pakistan had been delimited, but Rann, a lake in the territory of Kutch, was still disputed.

Pakistan built posts near the disputed waters, and India constructed their own posts in response. Clashes ensued.

This dispute is related to the conflict between India and Pakistan beginning in 1947 over control of the disputed territory of Kashmir. Preceded by general low level violence along the Kashmiri border, an attack on the Indian Parliament in Delhi by Islamic terrorists occurs in July 2001. India accuses Pakistan of harboring the terrorist organizations and initiates a full mobilization of its military forces and moves those forces to the Indian/Pakistani border. Pakistan responds with its own military mobilization and heavy fighting breaks out along the border. The fighting subsides following visits to both countries by Richard Armitage (Dep. Asst. Sec. of State) and Donald Rumsfeld (Sec. of Defense) in June 2002. Kargil? First day of dispute was on 7/13/2001 and last day of dispute was on 11/22/2003.

NARRATIVE-CM:
India and Pakistan disputed the sovereignty of the Kashmir region in northern India after attaining independence from Britain on August 15, 1947. Muslim tribesmen commanded by General Akbar Khan invaded Kashmir from Pakistan to support the *Azad Kashmir* rebellion in the territory on October 20, 1947.

This rivalry is unfinished as of December 2006. The major issue of contention, Kashmir, was not solved. Lashkar-e-Toiba, a terrorist group allegedly supported by Pakistan conducted several terrorist actions in India. On December 22, 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot. The attack was significant because it was carried out just two days after the declaration of the cease-fire between India and Pakistan. Two Kashmiri terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed raided the Swami Narayan temple complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat killing 30 people, including 18 women and five children. The attack was carried out on September 25, 2002, just few days after state elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Two identical letters found on both the terrorists claimed that the attack was done in retaliation for the deaths of thousands of Muslims during the Gujarat riots. Two car bombs exploded in south Mumbai on August 25, 2003; one near the Gateway of India and the other at the famous Zaveri Bazaar, killing at least 48 and injuring 150 people. Though no terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks, Mumbai Police and RAW suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba's hand in the twin blasts. In an unsuccessful attempt, six terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba, stormed the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhomi complex on July 5, 2005. Before the terrorists could reach the main disputed site, they were shot down by Indian security forces. One Hindu worshipper and two policemen were injured during the incident. The 2007 Samjahutta Express bombing (on the train connection between Pakistan and India) and the 2008 Mumbai bombings, even though perpetrated by terrorists, are proof that the relationship is still difficult and the rivalry is not finished.

SB-CR:
India / Pakistan Years: 1947-Present. Issues at stake: Border between India and Pakistan. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no accepted settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 15. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1986. Wars: 1947-1949, 1965, 1971. Summary: When giving up colonial India, British intent was to create two states, one Hindu (India) and one Muslim (Pakistan). There were 562 Princely states on the Indian subcontinent which were not formally part of British India; theses were given the choice of joining either India or Pakistan. However, because of rising violence leading to a growing British desire to leave, the British moved up the dates of independence for India and Pakistan from June 1948 to August 1947, leaving little time for the Princely states to choose. In fact, three of these states failed to announce a decision by August 15, 1947; it is control over these areas that forms the basis of the Indian-Pakistani rivalry. The three states that had not chosen by 1947 were Junagadh, Hyderabad, and Kashmir. Within a month, Junagadh opted to join Pakistan, even though it was predominantly Hindu and shared no border with Pakistan. India did not want to be a geographically non-continuous state and occupied Junagadh with a military force in October. Pakistan did not respond militarily to the occupation. Similarly, Hyderabad, in the middle of India, opted for independence, but India occupied and incorporated it. Pakistan again did not respond militarily. It was in Kashmir that fighting first broke out between India and Pakistan. Kashmir also opted for independence, but it was internally divided between the predominantly Hindu state of Jammu and the predominantly Muslim remainder. the First Kashmir War begins when Pakistani military officers tried to assist a group of Kashmiris to take over Kashmir. The government in power in Kashmir then formally acceded to India; India intervened militarily, followed by the intervention of regular Pakistani forces. The start of the war in 1947 marks the beginning of the rivalry. Disputes over various border areas continued through the 1950s and 1960s, often at the same time as negotiations. The second Kashmir war in 1965 led to the Tashkent declaration that temporarily reduced tensions through a troop pullback; a set of negotiations followed that resulted in a 1968 tribunal ruling in which most of the Rann of Kutch region (in Junagadh) was given to India. However, no resolution of the Kashmir dispute was reached. Another war broke out over the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, which India supported. No militarized disputes occurred between 1973 and 1980, but a series of disputes from 1981 to 1986 demonstrated the continuing hostility between the India and Pakistan. No settlement of the dispute has yet been reached. This rivalry is unfinished as of December 2006. The major issue of contention, Kashmir, was not solved. Lashkar-e-Toiba, a terrorist group allegedly supported by Pakistan conducted several terrorist actions in India. On December 22, 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot. The attack was significant because it was carried out just two days after the declaration of the cease-fire between India and Pakistan. Two Kashmiri terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed raided the Swami Narayan temple complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat killing 30 people, including 18 women and five children. The attack was carried out on September 25, 2002, just few days after state elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Two identical letters found on both the terrorists claimed that the attack was done in retaliation for the deaths of thousands of Muslims during the Gujarat riots. Two car bombs exploded in south Mumbai on August 25, 2003; one near the Gateway of India and the other at the famous Zaveri Bazaar, killing at least 48 and injuring 150 people. Though no terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks, Mumbai Police and RAW suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba's hand in the twin blasts. In an unsuccessful attempt, six terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba, stormed the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhomi complex on July 5, 2005. Before the terrorists could reach the main disputed site, they were shot down by Indian security forces. One Hindu worshipper and two policemen were injured during the incident. The 2007 Samjahutta Express bombing (on the train connection between Pakistan and India) and the 2008 Mumbai bombings, even though perpetrated by terrorists, are proof that the relationship is still difficult and the rivalry is not finished.
