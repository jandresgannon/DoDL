TERRMID-NOTES: MID1189 from Keesings (1976: 27970-27972), Guyana's government began taking steps toward socialism, nationalizing several industries in an acquiescence to the major opposition party in Guyana. This led to international tensions from anti-socialist governments, including Brazil. Here, Guyana protested when Brazilian newspapers began to print anti-Guyana propaganda, and protested again when Brazil amassed troops on the border. Brazil also requested an inspection of the border markers, and while this was routine in the past, Guyana expressed concern that this was a pretext for invasion because Brazil was unhappy with Guyana's moves toward socialism. Coded not territory because the border was not disputed and this was not an advancement of a territorial claim, but was rather a political ideology issue.
