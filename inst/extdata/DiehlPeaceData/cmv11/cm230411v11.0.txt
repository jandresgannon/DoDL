NARRATIVE-CM:
Equatorial Guinea formally achieved its independence from Spain on October 12, 1968. Spain mobilized some 260 troops in the country after a Spaniard was killed during a riot in Rio Benito on February 25, 1969. President Francisco Macias Nguema referred the matter to *United Nations* (UN) Secretary-General U Thant on February 28, 1969, and declared a 15-day state-of-emergency on March 1, 1969. Government troops suppressed an attempted rebellion led by Foreign Minister Anastasio N'Dongo Miyone on March 5, 1969. UN Secretary-General U Thant sent a three-member fact-finding mission (Bolivia, Brazil, Gabon) headed by Marcial Tamayo of Bolivia to the country on March 10-25, 1969. Some 100 individuals, including Foreign Minister N'Dongo Miyone, were executed for their involvement in the attempted rebellion. Some 5,000 Spaniards fled the country between February 25 and March 28, 1969.
