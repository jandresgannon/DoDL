This dispute stems from an underlying territorial issue between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. While Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory, it is primarily populated by ethnic Armenians. In 1988, Nagorno-Karabakh had attempted to re-unify with Armenia, and subsequently declared independence from Azerbaijan, resulting in civil conflict. Armenia eventually intervened in the conflict, which ended in a 1994 ceasefire. Since that time, Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding territories have been jointly controlled by the defense forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic and the Armenian military. Since then each side has engaged in frequent border violations, seizures, and clashes, which comprise the majority of incidents in this militarized dispute. A difficulty encountered when coding these issues was that news reports seldom make any distinction between Armenian military forces, and the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Force, which is ethnically Armenian and contains a substantial number of Armenian citizens. Given this issue and the high degree of coordination between Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh forces, no differentiation could be made between each group. Thus, all actions taken between these groups and Azeri forces were coded as interstate incidents. First day of dispute was on 8/9/2002 and last day of dispute was on 11/20/201011.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliev on June 23, 2006, warned that talks with Armenia over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh were going nowhere and vowed to recover the territory. "The negotiations are taking place in different frameworks but these talks are ineffective because we can't obtain a result," Aliev said, accusing Armenia of dragging out the negotiating process. "Azerbaijan will restore its territorial integrity, either through peaceful or military means," he said. The two former Soviet Caucasus nations' presidents made two failed efforts this year to resolve the status of the disputed enclave.

Sporadic border clashes regularly break out. The unresolved conflict has held up development in the strategic region.
