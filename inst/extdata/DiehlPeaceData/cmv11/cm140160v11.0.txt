NARRATIVE-CM:
Argentine and Brazilian representatives signed a border agreement in Parana, Argentina on December 14, 1857, which provided for the demarcation of the border. The Argentine Congress ratified the agreement with modifications on September 24, 1858, but Brazil did not agree to the modifications. Argentine and Brazilian representatives signed an arbitration agreement in Buenos Aires on September 7, 1889, which provided for the submission of the border dispute to the president of the United States for arbitration. Emperor Pedro II of Brazil abdicated on November 14, 1889, and the Republic of Brazil was proclaimed on November 15, 1889. President Benjamin Harrison of the US agreed to arbitrate the border dispute on July 2, 1892. President Grover Cleveland of the US issued an award on February 5, 1895. The countries completed demarcation of the border on October 4, 1910.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Brazil and Argentina's rivalry existed because of mutual suspicion by both countries over the other's regional intentions. Each side throughout the 19th century suspected the other of trying to increase its territory and influence in the region at the expense of the other. This mutual distrust originated from conflict prior to Argentina's birth as a nation-state in the early 19th century which left unsettled boundary issues between them. Four mids makeup the rivalry.

In April of 1851, Brazil and Uruguay allied with Justo Urquiza of Argentina to defeat dictator Juan Manuel de las Rosas (MID1528 on 4/15/1851). Brazil's motivation was to eliminate the Argentine threat to the Plata region, a region to which Brazil wanted to lay claim. Rosas also wanted this area as part of a larger plan of reconstruction of the Viceroyalty of La Plata. 

From 1865 to 1870, Brazil and Argentina were allied with Uruguay against Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. Both countries occupied Paraguay until 1876. There were three mids during this period, involving the occupation of Paraguay (MID1527 on 3/22/1872, MID1526 on 9/29/1873 and MID2044 on 6/19/1875). The two countries were in dispute over mutual distrust as to the other's desire to claim Paraguayan territory. This distrust led to the six year occupation and tension between the two countries' troops in Paraguay with each side refusing to depart the war torn country. With Brazil occupying Asuncion, Argentina was at a disadvantage and began efforts to end the occupation. On February 3, 1876 Brazil and Argentina signed a definitive treaty ending the occupation and reached an agreement that allowed Paraguay to remain independent. By May 1876, both countries had left Paraguay. 

After the departure from Paraguay, the rivalry between Argentina and Brazil fizzled out. The mutual suspicion of each country gave way to both sides turning inward to reform themselves domestically. In Brazil, the economic devastation caused by the war led to economic reform that broke up traditional oligarchies. Coffee, rubber and cacao exports began to grow, increasing capital in the urban sectors of the country. Increased capital led to urban improvements from waste control to eduacation. Consistent ecnomic reform led to social reform as well. Slavery began to receive continuous criticism nationally. As slavery began to die out and eventually end as an institution in 1888, employment opportunities opened throughout the urban centers. Social and economic mobility increased. Economic growth created an increased demand for political power as well, leading all of these reforms to the overthrow of the monarchy by military coup in 1889 in favor of a republic. 

In Argentina, the turn inward focused on expanding its usable territory by pushing Indian populations beyond the Rio Negro by military force. By 1879, Argentina was able to sell additional land, clearing the way for farming down into Patagonia. Unlike Brazil, however, Argentina continuously suffered disputes between the Federal government and its provinces. By 1880, Argentina was domestically divided with two governments competeing for power in Buenos Aires, President of the Nation and Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires. This competition led to civil conflict between "nationalists" and the Federal Government against Buenos Aires. The Federal Government won the conflict, leaving it the task of political and economic consolidation. Given this internal dimension, Argentina could hardly focus on any contest with Brazil over regional issues.

In 1889, Brazil and Argentina began negotiating a final settlement to the border dispute between them. On January 25, 1890 the two countries signed a treaty settling the dispute with the recognition of a compromise line in the Misiones region. The treaty called for arbitration by a third party if the two countries were unable to settle the dispute within a 90 day period. In April 1892, the US acted as arbiter in the dispute under President Grover Cleveland. On February 6, 1895 the arbitration was decided in favor of Brazil. Both countries accepted the decision and signed a protocol to that effect on August 9, 1895 and an additional treaty formally settling the dispute in 1898.

The Brazil-Argentina rivalry seemingly comes to an end at this point. While the border issues really did serve as the cause of the rivalry, the ability to formally settle them does indicate amicable relations between the two countries. There does not seem to be any one reason as to why the mutual suspicion and challenge for regional supremacy ends so quickly between the two countries. However, with the focus on domestic problems there does seem to be the possibility that the rivalry was simply a result of colonial independence and as each country secured its own integrity there was less of a reason to be concerned with the affairs of the neighboring country and its intentions. 

The last mid (MID2983 on 1/19/1983) involved the seizure of a Brazilian icebreaker by an Argentine launch and is definitely an isolated dispute.

18410101-18720321 0.25 & 18760101-19791018 RIV315-0.25 

Brazil's COW state date is 01011826, Argentina's is 01011841, and the start date of the dyad is 01011841. William Thompson (2001) codes the rivalry between Argentina as existing from 1817-1985 dating to `Iberian colonial rule' (Resende-Santos, 2002: 91). The Klein et. al operationalization of rivalry identifies this dyad at rivalry from 18720322-18751230 with an isolated dispute occurring in 1851 and again in 1983. 

As the operationalization of rivalry by the Klein et al standards and the additional application of the Thompson coding, the dyad is in a period of unstable peace from its outset until the rivalry begins in earnest from 1872-1875 after which in remains in a state of unstable peace until 1979. The first MID of RIV314, MID1527, started on March 22, 1872. The last MID of RIV314, MID2044, ended on March 3, 1876. 

19791019-19860728 Transition 

Though Thompson codes the dyad at rivalry until 1985, there is a period of transition in the dyad that dates to the late 1970s. The year 1979 is chosen as a start date for the transition from unstable peace to stable peace because of the signing of an agreement on the use of hydroelectric power on the Parana River on October 19, 1979. This was a 13 year dispute between Brazil and Argentina (Kacowicz, 2000: 204). Motivations to reach an agreement included the length of the dispute, tensions with the British over the Falklands/Malvinas, increasing Brazilian nuclear developments, Brazilian economic and military superiority, and deteriorating relations with the Chileans (especially after the Beagle Channel Islands were awarded to Chile in 1977). In 1980, the dyad further improved their relations by exchanging presidential visits and signing 10 agreements on a variety of topics including joint arms production and nuclear cooperation (joint research and transfer of nuclear materials). The agreements of 1980 was considered very important given the historic rivalry for regional supremacy between Argentina and Brazil (Kacowicz, 2000: 204). In addition, both countries returned to more democratic governments in the early 1980s (Argentina, 1983 and Brazil, 1985).

NOTE: We may also consider coding this at the 0.5 level. The two sign an agreement in 1979 over a resource dispute and subsequently sign several agreements of cooperation in nuclear technology and use. However, there is a subsequent dispute in 1983. Although, the dispute is basically a fishing boat dispute. From above: the last mid (MID2983 on 1/19/1983) involved the seizure of a Brazilian icebreaker by an Argentine launch and is definitely an isolated dispute. 

19860729-20159999 0.75

Argentina and Brazil are coded at the 0.75 level beginning in July of 1986 because it is at this point that the sign the Argentine-Brazil Integration Act and the Integration and Cooperation Program (ABEIP). This agreement was designed to renew previous attempts to spur economic growth and competitiveness by liberalizing foreign trade policies. This project began with a set of protocols that lowered tariff barriers in specific industries. The original agreements called for meetings between the presidents of both countries every six months, when they would sign additional protocols.

From 1986 until 1990, both governments sought to increase their level of nuclear cooperation and economic integration. During this period a well developed bilateral nuclear cooperation regime developed with efforts on both sides towards confidence building measures (Kacowicz, 2000: 205). 

In 1991, Argentina and Brazil partnered with Uruguay and Paraguay to form MERCOSUR. Its purpose is to promote free trade and the fluid movement of goods, peoples, and currency. In September of 1996, Brazil and Argentina conducted joint military exercises for the first time in over 100 years. In 1997, the countries signed an agreement of understanding outlining areas of mutual security. However, the goals of the current cooperation are not to form an institutionalized defense mechanism but to provide for transparency and to increase confidence in the region. 

Thus, the dyad has the indicators associated with the 0.75 positive peace level. There are no plans for war and the idea of conflicts between the two during this period is unthinkable (Kacowicz, 1998: 85). The issues that motivated the rivalry were regional supremacy which appears to have been mitigated by economic considerations, movements towards democracy, and domestic and international diversions. The dyad has established institutionalized mechanisms for communication through their various agreements discussed above. Finally, they have begun the process of integration beginning with MERCOSUR.
