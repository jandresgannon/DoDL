CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID145 from cm002710v11.0 narrative, this is a naval incident involving US and UK vs. China that occurred February and March 1927. China had been divided along Communist and KMT (led by Chiang Kai-Shek, an anti-communist) fighting for years and would continue until 1949 as the Chinese Civil War. This MID occurred when fighting broke out in Shanghai and Nanking, causing the US and UK to increase naval and ground forces at those locations. Some shelling of Chinese territory occurred to protect US and UK interests. Spain also deployed warships to assist the US and UK. Coded civil war MID because militarized factions in China were fighting, which threatened US and UK interests and caused those countries (along with Spain here) to threaten and use force against China, triggering this MID.
