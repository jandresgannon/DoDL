TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3038 from NYT 12/10/1984, Iraq bombed a Bahaman oil tanker in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War. Iraq and Iran routinely bombed oil tankers trading with the other country as a way of damaging the other's oil exports, thereby harming the enemy's war efforts. Here, Iraq bombed the Bahaman tanker when it was on its way to pick up crude oil from Iran. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the Iran-Iraq War was a territorial MID, and this MID was directly connected to that war.
