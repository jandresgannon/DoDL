TERRMID-CER: MID2192 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID2192 1 -- third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID2192 2 -- somewhat certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2192 from cm narrative, occurred July 1977 to March 1978. North Korean troops shot down a US military helicopter over North Korea on July 14, 1977, resulting in the deaths of three US military personnel. Coded somewhat certain because it is unclear whether this was connected to US support for South Korea or to general Cold War tensions. Previous Cold War MIDs between US and NK involved US reconnaissance planes or vessels being shot down or captured, and this was not a recon vehicle. It therefore seems unlikely that this was an intelligence mission, as helicopters are not typically used for intelligence gathering; however, it is not clear whether the helicopter was patrolling the DMZ for South Korea. South Korea is involved in this MID, suggesting that it involved the DMZ, which is connected to the territorial dispute. 

MARITMID: MID2192 3 -- not maritime

CIVWARMID: MID2192 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID2192 2 -- somewhat certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2192 not certain whether this is connected to Cold War tensions or patrolling of the DMZ, but it seems unlikely that this was a reconnaissance mission, and recon missions are usually the trigger for Cold War MIDs between US and NK. South Korea is involved in this MID, suggesting it is connected to that civil war/territorial dispute. 

CIVWARLINK: MID2192 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID2192 2 -- somewhat certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2192 coded somewhat certain because the exact nature of this MID is not clear, although it seems more likely than not to be a territorial and civil war multilateral MID. Coded civil war link because the civil conflict element will involve South Korea as well, outside of this dyad.

Tension between the US and North Korea increased over North Koreas pursuit of nuclear weapons. The US military increased its naval presence around the Korean peninsula with several additional warships. North Korea responded with its own shows of force in the waters of the Yellow Sea. In one incident, North Korea mobilized several planes to chase off American planes that had entered North Korean airspace.

The impetus of this particular MID was the joint US-ROK military maneuvers in 2009, which North Korean strongly protested. However, the larger underlying issues remain the demarcation of the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea and continuing tension around the DMZ between PRK and ROK (see MID 30201 and 30802). The majority of incidents involve shows of force by North and South Korea, mostly via North Korean warships crossing over the NLL. Several threats were also made about increasing hostilities should such shows of force happen. The MID reached a height when North Korean forces shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing several soldiers and resulting in an artillery clash between the two sides. Ultimately, the hostilities between the countries subsided to their normal level of intensity. First day of dispute was on 7/25/2010 and last day of dispute was on 11/26/2010.

In the wake of continued concern over the North Korean nuclear program, the US and South Korea began conducting joint exercises. North Korea threatened in March 1993 to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and ban inspections of its nuclear facilities. As a result, the US-ROK exercises, which were cancelled in the previous year, were conducted in 1993. In response, North Korea placed its forces on alert, declaring a "semi-war footing." South Korea also declared an alert of its own. In the wake of continued concern over the North Korean nuclear program, the US and South Korea began conducting joint exercises.

This dispute consisted of 49 incidents that occurred between 10/10/94 and 9/99. Although this is a large number of incidents over a long period of time, the longest duration between incidents was approximately 5.5 months. In addition, the pattern in which the incidents occurred suggests that they are linked and should be considered as one dispute. In the dispute, North Korea continually challenges South Korean territorial boundaries along the DMZ and in the waters along the Northern Limit Line. South Korea responds by placing its forces on alert, conducting military exercises, showing ships and planes, and clashing with North Korean vessels that cross into South Korean waters and North Korea troops that cross the DMZ. Despite the distinction between the land and naval incursions by North Korea, their timing close together suggests a broader effort to challenge South Korean borders. On 4/10/97 (incident FE00190) North Korean troops crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory. Less than 2 months later (FE00194), North Korean vessels crossed into South Korean waters and a clash between North and South Korean vessels ensued. Slightly more than one later (FE00192), on 7/10/97 North Korean troops again crossed the DMZ and another clash ensued. Furthermore, throughout this period North Korean submersibles violated both South Korean waters and land. The South Korean reaction to these incidents also suggests that they were viewed as broader challenges to South Korean territory rather than separate challenges along the DMZ. For example, as a result of the 7/16/97 clash in the DMZ, South Korea placed its forces along both the DMMMZ and Northern Limit Line on alert in incident FE00217. During the dispute the incidents of highest severity included: 12/17/94 - North Korean forces shot down an American helicopter that had strayed across the DMZ (FE00038), 5/30/95-North Korea fired at and seized a South Korean fishing vessel that had strayed into North Korean waters, 6/5/97 - A clash between North and South Korean vessels when a North Korean vessel crossed into Southern waters (FE00194), 7/16/97-A clash between North and South Korean troops when 14 North Korean troops crossed the DMZ (FE00192), 9/9/97-South Korean forces intercepted and killed a North Korean soldier that had crossed teh DMZ (FE00199), 12/18/98-A clash occurred when South Korean forces chased and fired upon a North Korean semi-submersible that had crossed into South Korean territory (FE00238), 6/15/99-A naval clash ensued when South Korean vessels rammed North Korean vessels that were violating South Korean waters (FE00268 & FE00267). Interspersed between these major actions were threats, border fortifications, alerts, and shows of force. First day of dispute was on 12/17/1994 and last day of dispute was on 6/00/1999.

This dispute consists of 2 incidents in which the United States and South Korea conducted landing exercises in the wake of suspicion that North Korea was preparing for a missile launch. The reports described the landings as a "show of strength against North Korea". Previously, on 6/16 the US increased patrols in the Yellow Sea, sending a guided missile cruiser, planes, and a destroyer.

This dispute consists of 2 incidents in which North Korea warned that if American or South Korean vessels go beyond designated lanes and waterways in the Yellow Sea it will be regarded as an intrusion into North Korean waters and would be subject to military retaliation. The dispute centers around the September 1999 declaration of a new military demarcation in the Yellow Sea, declaring the Northern Limit Line established after the Korean War invalid. South Korea has ignored the declaration and US-led United Nations takes the position that the NLL has been recognized and maintained as the de factor maritime border for 35 years. First and last day of dispute was on 3/23/2000.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the US and North Korea dates to the Korean War and continues to today. It began as an ideological rift in the context of the Cold War as the US supported the South Koreans in their effort against the communist North Koreans. The rivalry has been particularly intense. Some have described the DMZ that forms the border between the two Koreas as the most dangerous place in the world. Hundreds of soldiers have died along this patch of earth in the last 50 years from the three parties involved: the North, South and US. 

MID51 is the Korean War. President Harry Truman of the United States ordered troops to South Korea on June 27, 1950 in support of the South Korean military after North Korea's invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950. US military aircraft shot down six North Korean military aircraft on June 27, 1950. North Korean troops captured Seoul on June 28, 1950. US troops were airlifted to South Korea from Japan beginning on June 30, 1950, and US troops commanded by General William Dean joined South Korean troops near Osan on July 4, 1950. Some 25,000 US troops commanded by General Edward Almond landed at Inchon on September 15, 1950, and re-captured Seoul on September 27, 1950. Some 13,700 North Korean soldiers and 536 US soldiers were killed during the US military offensive. US troops crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea on October 7, 1950, but were pushed back into South Korea by Chinese and North Korean troops on December 26, 1950. US and North Korean representatives signed a ceasefire agreement on July 27, 1953. 

MID2244 occurred from April of 1954 until November of 1956. This MID is a series of violations of the Korean War truce. On February 5, 1955, the North Korean and US air forces clashed over the Yellow Sea. A Korean Mig fired on a US reconnaissance plane. North Korean anti-aircraft artillery shot down a US military aircraft over the DMZ on August 17, 1955, resulting in the death of one US military personnel. 

MID2187 occurred from March of 1958 until October of 1961. This period was marked by particularly high tensions in talks regarding truce violations. On 9/8/1958 two South Korean soldiers were killed in the DMZ by North Korean army patrols. 

MID2189 occurred from May of 1963 until November of 1964. On July 29 and 30, 1963 three US soldiers, one North Korean soldier, and one South Korean policeman were killed when a North Korean unit infiltrated six miles south of the DMZ and ambushed a patrol of US/ROK forces. On 8/2/1963 sporadic firefighting broke out on the DMZ resulting in the deaths of N. Korean army personnel while attempting to infiltrate S. Korea. 

MID1379 is the MID that covers the period from August of 1964 until October of 1969. During this period the South Koreans and N. Koreans clashed a number of times. The North infiltrated the South on several occasions resulting in armed clashes and the deaths of hundreds of soldiers on both sides. Additionally, there were many clashes along the DMZ resulting in the deaths of soldiers from all three states involved, the North, the ROK, and th US.

MID362 or the tree trimming incident occurred in August of 1976. During the "Hatchet Incident", North Korean troops attacked an American-South Korean party that had gone to trim a tree next to the Bridge of No Return in the Demilitarized Zone. Two American officers were beaten to death with the blunt end of axes after they ignored the North Koreans' order to desist. This resulted in a US ultimatum to North Korea. The US placed its military forces in South Korea on alert on August 18, 1976. The Soviet Union called for the withdrawal of US military forces from South Korea on August 19, 1976. The *Non-Aligned Movement* (NAM) condemned US aggression against North Korea. North Korean and US representatives signed an agreement on September 6, 1976, which provided for a North Korean apology for the recent killing of US troops in the DMZ and the withdrawal of the US ultimatum. 

MID2192 occurred from July of 1977 until March of 1978. North Korean troops shot down a US military helicopter over North Korea on July 14, 1977, resulting in the deaths of three US military personnel.

MID2979 occurred on 1/9/1982. The US flew a reconnaissance plane over N. Korea in a display of force. 

MID2195 occurred in February of 1983. The US and ROK conducted a large military exercise in a display of force. The North responded by putting its entire military on a state of high alert. 

MID4021 occurred in March of 1993. North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on March 12, 1993. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) called upon North Korea to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the NPT on March 13, 1993. 

MID4022 occurred from November of 1993 through April of 1995. North Korea withdrew from the IAEA on June 13, 1993 after the IAEA suspended technical assistance to North Korea on June 10, 1993. The US called for economic sanctions against North Korea on June 14, 1993. US and North Korean representatives held negotiations in Geneva on July 14-19, 1993. US and North Korean representatives signed an interim agreement on February 25, 1994, which provided for the resumption of IAEA inspections of North Korean nuclear weapons program. North Korea temporarily refused permission for the IAEA to inspect its nuclear weapons program on March 14, 1994. The UN secretary-general called for a resumption of IAEA inspections in North Korea on March 31, 1994. North Korea agreed to resume IAEA inspections on April 19, 1994. Jimmy Carter of the US met with President Kim Il-Sung of North Korea in June 1994.

MID4125 occurred in June and July of 1999. The navies of the two Koreas clashed earlier in the year over disputed waters. Subsequent to the clash tension between the two navies was extremely high. The US sent warships to the region in a display of force attempting to dissuade the use of further force. 

Relations between the US and North Korea remain tense today. George W. Bush included North Korea in the 'Axis of Evil' state of the union speech of 2002. Kim Jong Il walked away from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 2003 and seems intent on precipitating crises with the United States in order to achieve concessions for North Korea. However, N. Korea seems to have been successfully deterred from full-scale war in the last half century and there are currently no signals that this stasis is in imminent danger of changing.

North Korea entered the international system in 1948, after talks of a unified and independent Korea failed to produce an agreement. The United Nations became involved heavily in Korean in 1948 in hopes of establishing a unified and independent state. The United States supported elections in South Korea in 1948 and recognized the resulting government as the legitimate government of Korea. There is no evidence of military hostilities between the United States and North Korea between 1948 and the outbreak of the Korean War. There is no political recognition, however, of the North Korean government by the United States. During the eighteen months leading up to the Korea War, there are repeated clashes along the border between North Korea and South Korea but no evidence that these involved United States troops. Indeed, US President Harry Truman orders the withdrawal of US forces on April 8, 1948 and the majority of US forces are withdrawn by June 29, 1949. Only a small contingent of US troops remained as part of the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG, about 200 men). 

Riv104, between the United States and North Korea, began with the onset of the Korean War (MID51) in 1950. The last recorded MID between the US and North Korea, MID4218, took place in March of 2000. 

In 2001, the United States (Bush Administration) discontinued nuclear and missile talks with North Korea, deciding instead to reevaluate relations. The US announced in July of 2001 a desire to reopen talks as long as issues such as North Korea's conventional force posture, missile development, and human rights issues were open for discussion. 

In October 2002, the US accused North Korea of pursuing a uranium enrichment program, in violation of the 1992 North-South Joint Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the Agreed Framework. North Korea declared its right to a uranium enrichment program and admitted to having the program. Later, North Korean denied the existence of the program. In November of 2002, shipments of heavy fuel oil were suspended until the nuclear issue could be resolved.

In 2002 and 2003 North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors and resumed reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium for weapons. North Korea claimed these actions were necessary as a deterrent to the U.S. 

In 2003, the US proposed multilateral talks on the North Korea nuclear issue. North Korea resisted, asking for bilateral talks. Through pressure from China, North Korea agreed to enter three-party talks (China, U.S. and N. Korea) and later six-party talks (China, U.S., N. Korea, South Korea, Japan, and Russia). Through these talks, North Korean offered to eliminate its nuclear program if the US signed a bilateral non-aggression pact, an offer the US refused. In October 2003, the US said it would consider a multilateral security guarantee only if there was a "complete, verifiable, and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons program."

Second and third rounds of six-party talks were held in February and June of 2004, respectively. Initially, a fourth round of talks were agreed to and scheduled for September 2004 but North Korea announced plans to walk away from negotiations. The DPRK subsequently, in February 2005, declared that it had successfully created a nuclear weapon and was suspending future talks. The KPRK also declared it would resume ballistic missile launches and that it was officially a nuclear state. 

In July-Sept of 2005, the fourth round of six-party talks resumed, resulting in the Joint Statement of Principles. At this time, North Korea agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons and programs and return to the NPT and IAEA safeguards. 

A fifth round of talks took place in November 2005 but the DPRK boycotted the talks, accusing the US of having a "hostile policy" toward them. The US continued talks throughout 2006 with the other members of the six-party talks. On July 4-5 of 2006, the DPRK "launched seven ballistic missiles, including six short-and medium-range missiles and one of possible intercontinental range. `' The UN Security Council subsequently adopted, unanimously, Resolution 1695 on July 15 demanding North Korea cease all missile activity. The resolution also called for UN members to "vigilantly" work to prevent all missiles and missile related material from reaching North Korea. North Korea rejected the resolution.

On October 9, 2006 North Korea announced the test of a nuclear device. The UN passed Resolution 1718 condemning the action and imposing sanctions against the state. 

Six-party talks resumed at the end of 2006. In January of 2007, the US and North Korea held bilateral talks in Berlin, followed by Six-Party talks in February 2007. North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility and to invite back the IAEA. The five-party states agreed to provide energy assistance to North Korea in return. Five working groups were also started, to meet within 30 days of the agreement, aimed at: denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, normalization of DPRK-US relations, normalization of KPRK-Japan relations, economic and energy cooperation, and a Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism. 

A sixth round of talks took place on March 19-23 of 2007. On July 2007, North Korea shut down the Yongbyon facility and the reactor at Taechon and allowed the IAEA personnel to monitor these events. 

At the beginning of the decade (2000), tensions between the United States and North Korea seems to be growing, especially after the United State's President George W. Bush referred to North Korea as part of the `Axis of Evil' in his 2002 State of the Union Speech. Subsequently, however, relations have warmed through the six-parties talks aimed at denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. It is too early to say whether or not these events mark a transition period out of rivalry. Such a determination will be heavily dependent on whether or not North Korea continues to cooperate on issues of denuclearization. For now, however, the relationship should be coded as a continuation of RIV104.
