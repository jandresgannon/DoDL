CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4283 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, this is the US invasion of Afghanistan following 9/11. After the US deposed the Taliban government, the Taliban and other militarized rebel groups fought against US and other countries' troops in Afghanistan. Several central Asian countries, including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, assisted the US by allowing them to use their territory for bases, and several also participated in shows of force against Afghanistan before the US invaded. Coded civil war link because the events of this MID involve militarized rebels in Afghanistan committing violence outside of this dyad (New York).

This dispute consists of a series of 35 militarized incidents that are centered around the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes against the United States. In response to the terrorist attacks, the United States demanded that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden and expel Al Qaeda members that were operating and training in Afghanistan. 9/15/01 - the United States, Great Britain, and France deployed naval forces to waters near Afghanistan. The United States deployed 2 aircraft carriers, Great Britain deployed 6 warships, and France deployed 2 warships. In response to the American deployment, Afghanistan placed its forces on alert and deployed anti-aircraft weapons around Kandahar. Russia, which had experienced previous disputes with Afghanistan along the Tajik border, placed its forces along the Tajik border on alert and mass weapons and troops along the border in response to the rising tensions in the region. 9/17/01 - American president Bush issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leadership to turn over Osama bin Laden or face American military strikes. The Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden unless a series of unreasonable conditions were met (trial by Muslim judge, recognition for the Taliban, foreign aid for Afghanistan, etc.) 9/22/01 - An American reconnaissance drone is shot down over Afghanistan. During this time, Great Britain began deploying special forces to Afghanistan 9/25/01 - British prime minister Tony Blair issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leaders to face military action if they do not turnover Osama bin Laden and shutdown the terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. 9/30/01 - The United States continued to increase the pressure on the Taliban by continuing to deploy forces to the region. In addition to the naval forces already deployed, the United States also sent ground forces to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and sent the USS Kitty Hawk carrier group to the region. The Taliban responded to the increasing American pressure by conducting exercises along its border with Pakistan. During this period of time Taliban forces also fired on a Russian border post along the Tajik-Afghan border. Russian forces suffered no casualties in the clash and returned fire at the Taliban forces. No information was given regarding Afghan casualties. Early October, 2001 - The British government issued a series of statements threatening military action against Afghanistan if the Taliban did not turn over Osama bin Laden. 10/6/01 - Afghanistan threatened war against Uzbekistan if the United States launched attacks from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan also began redeploying forces to its border with Uzbekistan. In response, Uzbekistan began deploying its forces along the border with Afghanistan. Reports also indicate that Afghanistan fired at an unmanned American drone conducting reconnaissance. As conditions deteriorated, Tajikistan placed its forces along the border on alert. 10/7/01 - American and British strikes on Afghanistan began. The first strikes involved attacks from cruise missiles, bombers, and missiles and initial targets were confined to airfields, command and control centers, military installations. 10/9/01 - NATO redeploys its naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the conflict in Afghanistan. Ships from Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and the United States participate in the redeployment. 10/10/01 - Following three days of sustained attacks, bombing targets began to include strikes against troops. Near this time, American and British forces began bombing Taliban forces positioned north of Kabul. These strikes involved the use of heavy cluster bombs and were likely to inflict heavy casualties on Taliban forces. These bombing strikes continued on a daily basis into November 10/16/01 - A Taliban gunman fired at a border picket occupied by Russian troops along the Tajik border. There were no Russian casualties in the attack. 10/17/01 - Reports indicate that Australian troops are now on the ground in Afghanistan conducted ground operations against Taliban and AlQaeda forces. 10/19/01-11/13/01 - US commando units began conducting ground operations within Afghan territory. These ground raids were used to attack Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces, flush them out for airstrikes, and for intelligence purposes. Two American soldiers were killed when their search and rescue helicopter crashed in Pakistan after a mission. These deaths are not counted in the dispute coding because they were accidental and did not result from military action. Allied airstrikes continue throughout this period. 11/13/01 - Russia "took additional security measures" along its border with Afghanistan. Taliban forces withdraw from Kabul and Northern Alliance troops take the capital. Because the Taliban has lost control of the capital, the dispute ends. First day of dispute was on 10/7/2001 and last day of dispute was on 10/10/2001.

Tajikistan became independent on December 26, 1991. On January 30, 1992, the Defence Committee of Tajikistan rejects a statement by one of the Afghan Mujahedin leaders on delivery of arms to the Kabul government. The Republic of Tajikistan has not and is not sending any kind of weaponry, military technology or military equipment to the Kabul government. This was said by Maj Gen Farukh Niyazov, the chairman of the Defense Committee of the Republic of Tajikistan, to a Tajikta correspondent. The general stressed that a statement by Nasrullah Mansur, the leader of the Harakat-e Enqilab-e Eslami-e Afghanistan, published in the 'Jamhuri-e Eslami' newspaper of Iran on 27th January, accusing the Central Asian republics, including Tajikistan, of delivering arms to Afghanistan does not correspond to reality. The general said that the Republic of Tajikistan has signed no agreement or treaty with the government of Afghanistan on arms deliveries. Arms and military technology situated on the territory of the republic are under strict control and cannot be taken out of the territory of the republic. There are no arms manufacturing factories in Tajikistan, and no arms have been delivered to Afghanistan from the territory of the republic. Gen Niyazov stressed that such false statements by the leaders of the armed Afghan opposition leaders will not contribute to the strengthening of good-neighborly relations between states.

On the invitation of Afghanistan's leader Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Imamali Rahmonov, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tajikistan paid an official visit to Afghanistan from 28th to 30th August, 1993. During his stay, Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan and Esteemed Imamali Rahmonov, the president of Tajikistan held a series of talks in an atmosphere of friendship and understanding. During exchanges on matters of interest and confirming the joint statement dated 13th August 1993 of the ministers of foreign affairs of both countries, the heads of states of the two countries, paying attention to positive historical relations between the peoples of both countries; respecting the principle of security on common borders; the expression of goodwill towards the development of comprehensive relations between the Islamic State of Afghanistan and the Republic of Tajikistan; emphasis on complete readiness of both sides for the purpose of establishing peace at the border; support for the principles of freedom and towards the expansion of friendly relations-the heads of states declare to their people. The Islamic State of Afghanistan and the Republic of Tajikistan are developing their relations of good-neighborliness, friendship and mutual cooperation on the basis of respect for national sovereignty, territorial integrity, noninterference in each others internal affairs and for the principle of peaceful coexistence.

Given that both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were involved in civil wars in the early 1990s, there no significant contacts between 1991 and 1993.

A decree by the president of Tajikistan on opening an embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan in the Islamic State of Afghanistan was announced on November 26, 2001. An embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan is to be opened in the Islamic State of Afghanistan in the city of Kabul. The government of the Republic of Tajikistan is to determine the structure and staff of the embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan in the Islamic State of Afghanistan and allocate the necessary funds to maintain it.

The leader of Afghanistan's interim government, Hamed Karzai, is to arrive in Tajikistan on 14 January, 2002 from China's capital Beijing. Karzai is going to discuss with Tajik President Emomali Rahmonov the problems of Afghanistan's post-war rebuilding, a diplomatic source in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS. The source said Karzai is likely to ask for broader assistance to the international humanitarian lifts to Afghanistan through Tajikistan's airports and for check-points at the Tajik-Afghan border. He will probably raise the question of future electricity supplies to Afghanistan's northern provinces. The diplomatic source said Tajikistan was among the first states to give moral and military support to the new government of Afghanistan in the fight against international terrorism spearheaded by the Taleban, and to give full approval to the US-led anti-terrorist operation. Tajikistan hailed Karzai's appointment as head of the interim government. Rahmonov said at meetings with representatives of the anti-Taleban coalition that he wanted to see at his southern border a peaceful and democratic state. "There is no doubt that during today's meeting, Hamed Karzai will get most sincere assurances that Tajikistan will give Afghanistan all necessary help and assistance," the foreign diplomat said.

Tajikistan's national airline on March 28, 2002, began passenger service to Afghanistan and officials announced plans to build five bridges connecting the countries. Both moves apparently reflect increased confidence in Afghanistan's stability following the fall of the Taliban and growing recognition of Tajikistan's importance as a conduit for aid and materiel badly needed by Afghanistan. The Tajikistan Airlines decision to open service between Dushanbe and Kabul, the Afghan capital, was largely in response to demand by businessmen, airline officials said. The flights are expected to go once a week. Most of the 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) Tajikistan-Afghanistan border is defined by the Pyandzh River, which currently is spanned only by two pontoon bridges. Officials said that an agreement signed between Tajikistan, the interim Afghanistan administration and the Aga Khan Foundation foresees the building of five bridges, which would have a capacity of more than 25 tons.

Tajikistan and Afghanistan will open diplomatic consulates in each other's countries, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah said on November 26, 2002 during a visit to the Tajik capital Dushanbe. The Tajik consulate will be the northern Afghan town of Mazar-e-Sharif and the Afghan consulate will be in Khorog, in southeast Tajikistan, Abdullah said after talks with Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov. Tajikistan and Afghanistan share a long, mountainous border, which is a key gateway for Afghan heroin on its way to Russia and Europe. More than 20,000 Russian border guards and soldiers patrol the Tajik side of the border for drugs and weapons smugglers.

A cooperation agreement between Tajikistan and Afghanistan's chambers of trade and industry has been signed, Tajik Avesta news agency web site reported on 15 September, 2004. The agreement was signed by the heads of the chambers of trade and industry of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Sharif Saidov and Gul Ahmad Khushmand respectively, the web site said.

On June 19, 2005, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, made an official visit to Tajikistan. The main objective of Hamed Karzai's visit to Tajikistan, which is considered his first visit to this country, is aimed at boosting ties between Kabul and Dushanbe. Karzai left Kabul for Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, to launch a bridge construction project named "Pol-e Dosti" [Friendship Bridge] on the Amu River. The bridge will link Tajikistan to Afghanistan. In his meeting with Tajik President Emomali Rahmonov, the Afghan president stressed the need to boost bilateral cooperation to tackle drug trafficking and to strengthen stability in the region. Tajikistan is one of the northern neighbors of Afghanistan and the border between the two countries is more than 1,300 km long. In addition, Afghanistan and Tajikistan have common culture, language and religion. As a result, the governments, as well as the people of the two countries, feel the need for boosting relations. During his first visit to Afghanistan last April, the president of Tajikistan also stressed the need to boost relations between the two countries and pledged further cooperation with the government of Afghanistan. According to political experts, this visit has significantly improved relations between the two countries. Construction of the bridge, which links Afghanistan to Tajikistan, will expand economic transactions between the two countries. The bridge on Amu River, with a length of 672 meters and width of 12 meters, will be built at a cost of 40m dollars funded by the US government. This project will be constructed by an Italian company. The bridge will link the northern areas of Amu River with Tajikistan. Afghanistan and Tajikistan have been confronting problems such as drug-trafficking and terrorist attacks in their border areas. Dramatic increase in poppy cultivation in Afghanistan over the past three years and its trafficking through the neighboring countries, such as Tajikistan, has created security and social problems in the countries bordering on Afghanistan. The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken strict measures in the fight against drug smugglers in areas on the border with Afghanistan. The strict measures by Iran have made the smugglers choose alternatives routes for drug trafficking. In fact, Tajikistan is one of the main countries, where narcotics are smuggled through. With the departure of the Russian troops from Tajikistan, there has been a considerable increase in drug trafficking from Afghanistan to other countries through Tajikistan. As a result, with the cooperation of the Afghan officials, the Tajik government is trying to reinforce security measures in its border areas so that it can fight drug trafficking in this country.

On December 22, 2006, it was announced that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting a project to tap Tajikistan's power surplus to meet shortages in neighbor Afghanistan through $56US.5 million in loans. Tajikistan's generated capacity is 4,405 megawatts per year, mostly from hydropower. An annual surplus of 1,500 gigawatt-hours is available for export, but only for about half a year during spring-summer. Part of this is exported through Uzbekistan but the rest goes unused. On the other hand, Afghanistan faces serious power supply shortages, expected to worsen as demand grows. Years of conflict have severely damaged the country's power generation, transmission and distribution systems, with power available for only a few hours per day across Afghanistan, including capital Kabul. To meet both countries' requirements, the project will build a 220 kilovolt double circuit transmission line to connect the hydropower stations on Tajikistan's Vakhsh River to the border town of Sherkan Bandar, then to Kunduz, Baglad, Pul-e-Khumri and finally Kabul. "The project offers a win-win situation for both Afghanistan and Tajikistan," Xavier Humbert, an ADB Energy Specialist, said in a statement. "It will restore power supply and reduce costs for consumers in the former while allowing Tajikistan to export 300 megawatts." The project's total cost is forecast at $109US.5 million, with ADB's loans comprising $35US million to Afghanistan and $21US.5 to Tajikistan. Other financiers include the OPEC Fund for International Development, Islamic Development Bank, Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, and the Afghanistan and Tajikistan governments. The project is slated for completion in March 2009 and June 2010 in Afghanistan and Tajikistan respectively.
