CIVWARLINK: MID3634 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3634 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3634 from Gibler 2018, this is connected to the ongoing civil war in Chad. Militarized rebels in Chad took control of Chad in 1983. The incumbent regime lost all but a small piece of territory it controlled, but it did still have soldiers fighting against the new regime. Libya opposed the new government, and Libyan troops clashed with Chadian forces. French troops also intervened on behalf of the new Chadian government and against Libyan forces. Coded civil war link because this is connected to the Chadian civil war, outside of this dyad. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Zaire a party to this dispute.
