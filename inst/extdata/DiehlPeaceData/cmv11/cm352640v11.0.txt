CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2171 From cm narrative, following Cyprus' independence, there were tensions between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriot residents. Some inter-communal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots occurred during this MID, but there is no indication in Gibler 2018, cm narrative, or news coverage of this MID that indicates that the violence was perpetrated by organized, militarized rebels. UCDP does not have a rebel group active in Cyprus at this time.

CIVWARMID: MID2172 3 -- not civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID2172 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2172 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, violence erupted between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in 1965. A member of the Turkish government suggested to the UN that Turkey may retaliate against Greek Cypriots if the violence was not stopped. Coded not civil war because this was connected to ethnic inter-communal violence in Cyprus, but there is no indication in cm narrative, Gibler 2018, or news coverage of this MID that the violence involved organized, militarized rebel groups. UCDP does not have a rebel group active in Cyprus at this time. Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped as Turkey's statement does not amount to a threat directed toward the government of Cyprus.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1280 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1280 from Gibler 2018, this MID was precipitated by Greek and Turkish armed civilian "patrols" clashing in Cyprus, which led to the Turkish government amassing troops near Cyrpus. Coded not civil war because, while Cyprus had inter-communal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, there is no indication in cm narrative, Gibler 2018, or news coverage of this MID that the violence involved organized, militarized rebel groups. UCDP has no active rebel group in Cyprus at this time.

TERRMID-CER: MID2178 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2178 from Gibler 2018, Turkey recognized a Turkish Cypriot state in Cyprus, and Turkey closed the border of that state in Cyprus. The border closure triggered this MID.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID2761 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, a Turkish soldier in Cyprus killed a Greek Cypriot border guard, broke into a home, and tried to rape a woman. Greek soldiers killed the Turkish soldier. Coded not territorial MID because this was not connected to the dispute over Cyrpus.

This MID deals with the issues surrounding the island of Cyprus. Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus repeatedly violate each others territory and airspace. These violationsare interrupted by the occasional display and threat of force. It does not end with a settlement; rather, the tensions simply cool. First day of dispute was on 6/3/1996 and last day of dispute was on 7/20/2001.

NARRATIVE-CM:

Cyprus proclaimed its independence on August 16, 1960. According to constitutional arrangements, Cyprus was to become an independent, non-aligned republic with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president. General executive authority was vested in a council of ministers with a ratio of seven Greeks to three Turks. (The Greek Cypriots represented 78% of the population and the Turkish Cypriots 18%. The remaining 4% was made up by the three minority communities: the Latins, Maronites and Armenians.) A House of Representatives of fifty members, also with a seven-to-three ratio, were to be separately elected by communal balloting on a universal suffrage basis. In addition, separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Communal Chambers were provided to exercise control in matters of religion, culture, and education. According to Article 78(2) any law imposing duties or taxes shall require a simple majority of the representatives elected by the Greek and Turkish communities respectively taking part in the vote. Legislation on other subjects was to take place by simple majority but again the President and the Vice-President had the same right of veto-absolute on foreign affairs, defence and internal security, delaying on other matters-as in the Council of Ministers. The judicial system would be headed by a Supreme Constitutional Court, composed of one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot and presided over by a contracted judge from a neutral country. The Constitution of Cyprus, whilst establishing an Independent and sovereign Republic, was, in the words of de Smith, an authority on Constitutional Law; "Unique in its tortuous complexity and in the multiplicity of the safeguards that it provides for the principal minority; the Constitution of Cyprus stands alone among the constitutions of the world"[5] Within a short period of time the first disputes started to arise between the two communities. Issues of contention included taxation and the creation of separate municipalities. Because of the legislative veto system, this resulted in a lockdown in communal and state politics in many cases.

Repeated attempts to solve the disputes failed. Eventually, on November 30, 1963, Makarios put forward to the three guarantors a thirteen-point proposal designed, in his view, to eliminate impediments to the functioning of the government. The thirteen points involved constitutional revisions, including the abandonment of the veto power by both the president and the vice president. Turkey initially rejected it (although later in future discussed the proposal). A few days later, on December 21, 1963 fighting erupted between the communities in Nicosia. In the days that followed it spread across the rest of the island. At the same time, the power-sharing government collapsed. How this happened is one of the most contentious issues in modern Cypriot history. The Greek Cypriots argue that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew in order to form their own administration. The Turkish Cypriots maintain that they were forced out. Many Turkish Cypriots chose to withdraw from the government. However, in many cases those who wished to stay in their jobs were prevented from doing so by the Greek Cypriots. Also, many of the Turkish Cypriots refused to attend because they feared for their lives after the recent violence that had erupted. There was even some pressure from the TMT as well. In any event, in the days that followed the fighting a frantic effort was made to calm tensions. In the end, on December 27, 1963, an interim peacekeeping force, the Joint Truce Force, was put together by Britain, Greece and Turkey. This held the line until a United Nations peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, was formed following United Nations Security Council Resolution 186, passed on March 4, 1964. On February 15, 1964 Turkey said that it will consider holding off an intervention in Cyprus only if there will be no more violence between the Greek and Turkish communities on the island. President Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus was deposed in a military coup on July 15, 1974, and Turkey responded by invoking Article 4 of the *Treaty of Guarantee* of 1959. Some 40,000 Turkish troops invaded the island of Cyprus to protect the interests of Turkish Cypriots beginning on July 20, 1974. The *United Nations *(UN) Security Council appealed for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal on July 20, 1974. Some 1,150 Greek troops intervened in support of the Cyprus government on July 20-21, 1974. The UN Security Council demanded a ceasefire and troop withdrawal on July 23, 1974. Foreign Secretary James Callaghan of Britain mediated negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriot representatives in Geneva from July 25 to August 14, 1974. Turkish troops occupied the northern part of the island, and Turkey agreed to a cessation of military hostilities on August 16, 1974. Some 7,000 Cypriots and 300 Turkish soldiers were killed during the conflict. Turkish Cypriots voted to established a Turkish Cypriot republic in the northern part of the island on July 8, 1975. Cyprus accused Turkey of failing to provide information regarding several missing Greek Cypriots, as well as other violations of the *European Convention on Human Rights*. Cyprus submitted the dispute to the *European Court of Human Rights* (ECHR) on September 8, 1999. Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, while Turkey's membership path is slowed down by its refusal to acknowledge the existence of Cyprus and to open its ports to Cypriot planes and ships. As of 2007 Turkey had 42,500 soldiers stationed in Northern Cyprus making the region one of the most militarized in the world.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The Cyprus-Turkey rivalry that began in March of 1965 involved two issues. The first is the Cold War and the second is whether there would be a Muslim/Turkish or Christian/Greek dominance in Cyprus. MID2171 was over Soviet placement of missiles in Cyprus. The missiles were to be shipped through the United Arab Republic based upon a September 1964 arms agreement (Facts on File). Turkey issued a statement saying it would bomb any missiles moved into Cyprus. The dispute was resolved through mediation with the Greek-Cyprus government.

MID2172 was a minor class between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The UN intervened on November 5th, 1965 and negotiated a ceasefire (Facts on File). MID1280 and MID1293 are both over Greek/Turkish control of Cyprus. In November of 1967 escalating tensions made a Cyprus war between Greece and Turkey seem inevitable. To avoid the war both sides began mediation and agreed to the withdrawal of all troops not permitted under the 1960 agreement (Facts on File). All war preparations were dismantled and all local military forces were disbanded. In addition there was a 4,500 man expansion of the UN Peace-keeping force. Both sides had 45 days to comply with the agreement. The agreement was accepted by both states and withdrawals began in early December (Facts on File). 

The war was not prevented, only delayed. In 1974 a war between Turkish-Cyprus and Greek-Cyprus began in July (MID1293). Turkish forces engaged Greek forces and by mid-August had seized control of the northern third of Cyprus. Turkey unilaterally ceased its military invasion on August 16th and announced its willingness to negotiate. Several military incursions still occurred after the ceasefire.

Konstantinos Karamanlis, who was in France, was called back to head the Greek-Cyprus Government. He met with the Allied powers in Geneva on July 25th to discuss the situation on Cyprus. A second conference was held on August 10th that resulted in Cyrpus being divided into a Turkish Cypriot zone and a Greek Cypriot zone in the south (www.onwar.com 2003).

MID2178 involved a Greek Cypriot Blockade of Northern Cyprus with the visit of the Turkish Premier on July 2nd, 1986. Turkey was reinforcing its support for global recognition of northern Cyprus as an independent state. The blockades ended July 12th (Facts on File). There is no recorded activity during the dates given for MID2761 or MID2760. In 1993 (MID4039) the election of a Greek-Cypriot who opposes the Muslim division on the island causes a dispute between Cyprus and Turkey. UN talks occurred discussing the Cyprus situation.

MID4038 occurred from January 22, 1993 to April 11, 1993. MID4038 was over the presence of a Turkish Military presence in Cyprus. Turkey claimed that it has the right to install military forces on several Greek islands, including Cyprus, under the Treaty of Lausanne, which only required partial demilitarization (Constas 1991).

Disputes over the continued frustration of Trade between Turkey and Greece over the re-election of Turkish-Cypriot leader (MID4094) and refusal of the Greek-Cypriots to recognize the northern splinter state. In addition, there were arguments over the UN plan for forming a federal state (FACTS ON FILE). MID4094 occurred from October 6, 1994 to November 14, 1995.

MID4095 occurred from June 6, 1996 to July 20, 2001. MID4095 relates to Turkish claims on waters in the Aegean that are also claimed by Greece. The 1958 Geneva Convention had allocated the continental shelf to Greece but Turkey was not a signatory and therefore did not recognize Greece's claims. Turkey rejected the Greek claim that they controlled 12 nautical miles instead of the 6 nautical miles that Turkey recognized. This dispute is ongoing and is likely to continue as there have been no clear decisions regarding control over the Aegean.

Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004, while Turkey's membership path is slowed down by its refusal to acknowledge the existence of Cyprus and to open its ports to Cypriot planes and ships. As of 2007 Turkey had 42,500 soldiers stationed in Northern Cyprus making the region one of the most militarized in the world.

Discussion:
MID4095 occurred from June 6, 1996 to July 20, 2001. MID4095 relates to Turkish claims on waters in the Aegean that are also claimed by Greece. The 1958 Geneva Convention had allocated the continental shelf to Greece but Turkey was not a signatory and therefore did not recognize Greece's claims. Turkey rejected the Greek claim that they controlled 12 nautical miles instead of the 6 nautical miles that Turkey recognized. This dispute is ongoing and is likely to continue as there have been no clear decisions regarding control over the Aegean.
This MID deals with the issues surrounding the island of Cyprus. Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus repeatedly violate each other's territory and airspace. These violations are interrupted by the occasional display and threat of force. It does not end with a settlement; rather, the tensions simply cool.
