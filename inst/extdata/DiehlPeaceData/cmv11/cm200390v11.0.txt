MARITMID-NOTES: MID1900 from Gibler (2018), this incident seems to be a duplicate of MID2883 but with a different month listed as the incident date. Further, Gibler (2018) argues that the events do not constitute a MID. A British frigate was allegedly found fishing in Danish waters and was subsequently boarded by a non-armed Danish party. The release was swiftly negotiated and no protest was lodged by either government, both of whom stated that this was a private business matter. Coded not maritime because this was not a maritime boundary dispute. Coded uncertain because Gibler (2018) argues that this is not a MID and is a duplicate.

RIV446: MID3.02 moves UK to Denmark's side in MID194 (1863). Hence RIV446 is no longer exists since it is a one-MID rivalry.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The British vessel *Red Crusader* was stopped by the Danish naval ship *Niels Ebbesen* off the coast of Denmark's Faroe Islands on May 29, 1961. The *Red Crusader, *which had been fishing in a Danish fishing zone, attempted to flee and was fired upon by the *Niels Ebbesen*. Denmark and Britain agreed to the establishment of a three-member commission of inquiry (Belgium, France, Netherlands) chaired by Charles de Visscher on November 15, 1961. The commission of inquiry issued a report on March 30, 1962, which found that there was "no proof of fishing" by the *Red Crusader *within the Danish fishing zone. Britain and Denmark agreed to mutually waive claims against each other in January 1963.

Discussion:
The narrative describes a maritime MID, but does not associate any of MIDS in this rivalry with this specific incident. Niether do the dates match for the MIDs and the incident described in the narrative.
