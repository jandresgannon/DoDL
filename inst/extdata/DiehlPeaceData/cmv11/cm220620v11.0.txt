NARRATIVE-CM:
General Khadaffi of Libya invaded the Tunisian town of Gafsa on January 27, 1980, when an attempted unification of Libya and Tunisia fell apart. France sent a small naval squadron to Tunis to prevent any further Libyan aggression. A Libyan mob burned the French embassy in Tripoli on February 4, 1980 as well as the consulate in Benghazi. Khadaffi then said that he would fight any French interventions in Africa in any way he could. France recalled its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Libya and ordered Libyan diplomats to leave France in response. In 1981, France decided to withhold 10 military boats that had been ordered by Libya four years earlier in response to Libya's military actions in Chad. France sent 3,000 troops and air support to Chad in August, 1983 for protection against Libyan invasion after urging from the US government. In October, 1983, a group of French citizens were harassed and kept back at the Tripoli airport in response to the detainment of a Libyan for extradition to Italy on murder charges. Both Libya and France agreed to withdraw from Chad in 1984 (Libya did not withdraw). France destroyed the Libyan constructed air runway in northern Chad in February, 1986 with Jaguar bombers. France joined the US and Britain in implementing sanctions against Libya in 1992 for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. France also believes that Libya was responsible for the mid-air bombing of a French DC-10 airliner that killed 171 over Niger in 1989.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The involvement of both France and Libya in the civil war in Chad formed the basis for MID3631, and part of the basis of the rivalry between the two countries as well. This was coupled with Libya's continued support of terrorist activities toward Western nations in general as the self-proclaimed leader of the pan-Arab world. France had a significant troop presence in Chad as well as other African countries during the late 1970s, which fueled Col. Qaddafi's animosity toward that country as part of the Western continued imperialism of the continent. The hostilities between the two countries also occurred in Tunisia when French troops came into conflict with rebels based in Libya on January 31, 1980.

General Khadaffi of Libya invaded the Tunisian town of Gafsa on January 27, 1980, when an attempted unification of Libya and Tunisia fell apart. France sent a small naval squadron to Tunis to prevent any further Libyan aggression. A Libyan mob burned the French embassy in Tripoli on February 4, 1980 as well as the consulate in Benghazi. Khadaffi then said that he would fight any French interventions in Africa in any way he could. France recalled its ambassador and diplomatic staff from Libya and ordered Libyan diplomats to leave France in response. This was MID3631.

Some 250 Libyan-trained insurgents attacked the Tunisian town of Gafsa on January 26-27, 1980, resulting in the deaths of 41 individuals. France sent military transport planes and military advisors to Tunisia on January 28, 1980, and deployed eight warships off the Libyan/Tunisian coast on January 30, 1980. Tunisia expelled the Libyan ambassador from Tunisia on January 30, 1980. Defense Secretary Harold Brown of the United States announced that he would expedite the delivery of armored vehicles, and the armored vehicles were sent to Tunisia on February 7, 1980. Libya demanded the withdrawal of French forces from Tunisia on February 12, 1980, and France withdrew its forces from Tunisia on February 13, 1980. This ended MID3016. On April 12, 1980, Tunisia executed 15 individuals who had participated in the Gafsa attack.

When Libya escalated its intervention into Chad in January 1981, France responded by sending more troops to counter the Libyan offensive. This was MID3633. In 1981, France decided to withhold 10 military boats that had been ordered by Libya four years earlier in response to Libya's military actions in Chad. 

France sent 3,000 troops and air support to Chad in August, 1983 for protection against Libyan invasion after urging from the US government. This began MID3634. In October, 1983, a group of French citizens were harassed and kept back at the Tripoli airport in response to the detainment of a Libyan for extradition to Italy on murder charges. Both Libya and France agreed to withdraw from Chad in 1984 (Libya did not withdraw). 

Tensions escalated again between the two countries on August 22, 1984 when Libya was accused of the mining of the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez. This was MID3041.

France destroyed the Libyan constructed air runway in northern Chad in February, 1986 with Jaguar bombers. This was MID3635.

France joined the US and Britain in implementing sanctions against Libya in 1992 for the 1998 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. France also believes that Libya was responsible for the mid-air bombing of a French DC-10 airliner that killed 171 over Niger in 1989.

The rivalry between France and Libya has not seen an actual MID since 1987. In that respect, the rivalry should be terminated. However, because of the continued presence of Col. Qaddafi in Libya, and his links to terrorist actions against France and other Western countries, it may be soon to consider it completely over.

France joined the US and Britain in implementing sanctions against Libya in 1992 for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. France also believes that Libya was responsible for the mid-air bombing of a French DC-10 airliner that killed 171 over Niger in 1989. France charged four Libyans, including a brother-in-law of Qaddafi, with the 1989 bombing. In December 1989, Libya suspended air, sea and communications links with France over a dispute regarding the French Government's decision to withhold the delivery of three Mirage fighter planes and other weapons purchased in the early 80s by Libya, but not delivered since 1986 under an EU embargo of Libya. On April 12, 1990 France and Libya engaged on a path to normalize relations due to the help Libya gave France to free French citizens held hostages in Lebanon by a group affiliated with Libya.

19511224-19780414 0.5

Libya became independent on December 24th, 1951. On September 8th 1969, Mouammer El Qaddafi became President of the Republic deposing the king Idriss I, in a military coup. On December 15th, 1969, President Pompidou announces the establishment of cordial relations with the new Libyan government. In 1970, France sells about 100 Mirage jet fighters to Libya. In February 1976, the number two in Libya, Commandant Jalloud paid a first visit of a Libyan official to Paris. From March 20-22nd,1976 French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac went to visit Libya. Chirac spoke highly of Qaddafi, comparing him to de Gaulle. A number of treaties of cooperation in the fields of economy, culture, science and maritime were signed. The Franco-Libyan relations during the presidency of Giscard D'Estaing (1974-1981) are characterized by a desire of France to contain the regional leader ambitions of Qaddafi and to contain its financing of terrorist groups.

19920212-20021017 Transition

Libya agreed on February 12, 1992, to provide evidence and witnesses in France's investigation of the explosion of a French airliner over Niger in 1989 that killed 170 people. On March 31, 1992 another round of U.N. Security Council sanctions closed all air links between Libya and France, and numerous Libya diplomats were sent home from various European capitals. These sanctions were taken in reply to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in which Libya was allegedly involved. In 1992 Libya agreed to cooperate with France to bring to justice the perpetrators of the 1989 bombing. In March 1993, France did not support the United States in its call to extend a trade, military and air embargo on Libya to the oil sector. In 1996 France later led calls to include Libya in a regional security system, fearing that leaving it out would be more dangerous. The European Union (EU) welcomed a Libyan delegation to Brussels in January 1996 to discuss ways of improving ties and to prepare for the visit to Libya of a high-level delegation from Belgium and Luxembourg later that month. Delegates agreed to hold another round of talks in April. Italy, which in January took over the revolving six-month EU presidency, said it was keen to improve ties between the EU and North African states, including Libya. In 1997, the president of the French-Libyan chamber of commerce, George Vaillant, said that the "French-Libyan political relations have improved recently and this could encourage French firms to turn towards this market." French exports to Libya rose to by 228 million dollars in the first eight months of 1997 and are expected to finish higher than 1996 when exports stood at 280 million dollars. Bilateral trade for 1996 rose by 30 percent compared to the period from 1992-1995 to reach 683 million dollars, including 403 million dollars worth of French exports to Libya, according to official statistics. "Libya is a promising market," the commercial counselor at the French embassy in Libya, Jean Paul Cosse, told representatives of 30 French firms who attended a special seminar on doing business with Tripoli, in 1997. Around 20 French firms, most of them oil companies, work in Libya, which in 1996 sold 1.7 million tons of crude oil to France. France is Libya's fourth trading partner, with Italy, Germany and Britain leading the way. 

Libya said on September 24, 1997 that it enjoys "excellent" relations with France and has given full cooperation to the investigation into the 1989 bombing of a French plane in which 170 people died. Libyan leader Moamer Gadhafi said, "There are no problems between Libya and France, and the two countries have excellent relations. On December 3, 1997, President Chirac of France has called for improved relations between France and Libya. In a personal message, M Chirac also thanked Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, for Tripoli's help in the investigation of the terrorist bombing of a French airliner in 1989. "In 1998, Libya's General Water Company has signed a technical co-operation agreement with Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux of France. The latter intends to participate in the building of a water-desalination plant in Tripoli. The deal comes in the wake of a visit to Paris by Libya's planning minister, Jadallah Azuz al-Talhi, who discussed a number of investment proposals with French companies. Mr al-Talhi told a meeting organised by the French group CNFP International that Libya intends to spend $2.3bn-2.5bn on infrastructure projects in the next few years and will be seeking extensive private-sector participation. In 1999, a Paris court convicted in absentia six Libyans, including Gadhafi's brother-in-law, for the bombing that killed all 170 on board, and sentenced them to life in prison. The six were never extradited to France, but Libya did agree to a court order transferring US$33 million to France to compensate the victims. In 2000, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that France will continue the process of normalizing relations with Libya, which has helped arrange the release of three French hostages by the Philippine Muslim rebels. In an interview with the daily Le Figaro, Vedrine said that the process of normalization of relations between Libya and the European Union (EU) began one and a half years ago when the United Nations suspended its sanctions against Libya after Tripoli agreed to hand over the suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am passenger plane over Lockerbie. Since then, the EU has suspended its economic embargo against Libya except that of arms, while Libya joined the EU-Africa summit held in Cairo in April 2000 and was invited to an EU-Mediterranean ministerial meeting held in Stuttgart in April 1999.

On October 18th, 2002, France's Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin and the Libyan counterpart Abdul Rahman Shalqam, in Paris opened the works of the French-Libyan joint committee, which meets for the first time in 20 years. This meeting, however, constitutes a new phase in the rapprochement between the two countries. Relations which were crowned the previous week by a visit to Tripoli held by the French foreign minister during which he met with the Libyan leader. The joint committee is composed of two committees assigned to cooperate in the cultural, scientific, technical and economic fields. Its task is to define the main pillars for cooperation between the two countries during the two and three coming years, according to the French Foreign ministry. In 2002, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin traveled to Libya in a bid to improve relations with the North African government, implicated in the bombing of a French airliner over the Sahara in 1989. In meetings with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Foreign Minister Abdel-Rahman Shalqam and Libya's African affairs minister, Ali al-Treiki, de Villepin discussed improving bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. Dominique de Villepin said his visit was in preparation for a bilateral panel meeting on cultural, scientific and economic exchanges scheduled for next week in France. This would be the first such meeting in 20 years, he said. "Colonial era is over. We are now cooperating with France to promote peace, development and stability in Africa," Libya's African Affairs Minister, al-Treiki said, adding he asked France to support Libya in its development programs in Africa by persuading the European Union to invest in the projects. De Villepin said coordination of the roles the two countries play in Africa was "very important" in face of many crises on the continent. Flights between France and Libya resumed in February 2002. In March 2004, France and Libya have signed two economic cooperation accords and will shortly sign a third, French Trade Minister Francois Loos said Sunday during an official visit to Tripoli. The signed treaties deal with investment and credit protection. The third accord, setting up a fiscal agreement between Tripoli and Paris, will be signed before Loos leaves Libya on Monday, the minister said. 

French President Jacques Chirac was to hold a meeting in November 2004 with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi as he continued his visit to the oil-rich North African nation, the first by a French head of state in more than half a century. On November 25, 2004, Chirac held an hour-long meeting with Gadhafi shortly after arriving, then applauded "an exceptional moment" for the two nations. Chirac quickly spelled out the business benefits France hopes to achieve in Libya's strategic sectors. To underscore Paris' commitment, he said that France plans to build a new embassy in Tripoli. "We have seen strong turbulence," Chirac said. But "this difficult period is happily behind us. Now, we have entered a dynamic and positive phase with the will to rebuild a strong dialogue and establish a true partnership," the French president said. Chirac's upbeat tone contrasted with years of tension as Libya, once considered a sponsor of terrorism, pursued policies that put it in the ranks of "rogue" states. France had particular problems with Libya, from its occupation of northern Chad in the 1980s to the downing of a French passenger jet in 1989 that killed 170 people, including 54 French. Tripoli's agreement to pay compensation unlocked the door to normalization. France and Libya must now "turn together toward the future," Chirac said. However, he made clear that France expects a return for its upbeat stance. The rapprochement must include "deep and confident political dialogue on subjects we cherish" and a strengthening of the French business presence in Libya. No French leader had visited Libya since it gained independence from Italy in 1951 until Chirac's 2004 visit. The roughly two dozen French business leaders accompanying Chirac included executives from French oil giant Total, gas firm Gaz de France, combat aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation and defense group Thales. Total Group was among many European oil companies that remained in Libya despite U.S. and U.N. sanctions imposed on the country in the 1980s. French trade with Libya stands at a yearly US$2.5 billion (Euros 1.9 billion), including an annual US$2 billion ([euro]1.5 billion) of Libyan oil exports to France. France plans to help Libya develop a civilian nuclear energy program, the Foreign Ministry said in May 2005, citing Tripoli's pledge not to develop weapons of mass destruction.

On October 18, 2006, informed sources in Paris and Tunis have said that negotiations between France and Libya over arms contracts have been taking place for some time, and that Tripoli is interested in modernizing its warplanes and buying new aircraft and vessels for its coastguard. French sources in Tunisia have reported that the French and the Libyans have in fact taken "long strides" towards the signing of a series of deals for the purchase of military and civilian aircraft, patrol boats, and radar equipment, in a development that restores relations to "the honeymoon" that existed before the late socialist president Francois Mitterrand took office in 1981. The sources said Paris has reached an advanced stage in the negotiations with Libya over a deal to modernize 30 Mirage-F1 warplanes it had bought from France before an embargo was imposed on the export of arms to Libya. The sources added that two companies, Astral and Dassault Aviation, are following up the technical negotiations which will determine the price of the cost of modernization and which ranges between 10m and 20m euros for every aircraft, depending on the level of renewal requested by the Libyans. This category of aircraft is equipped with Magic air-to-air missiles. The French military industrialization group EADS is studying the conclusion of a deal with Libya to equip it with a radar system that monitors the borders and oil sites. The Libyans showed a preference for an air defence system known as Aster, except that its sale to foreign countries is banned, and that has prompted the Libyans to consider an alternative radar system. Libya's military modernization plan is not confined to the air force but also includes naval defences. The sources said that in July 2006 Libya signed a 400m-Euro deal with two companies, Thales and Mechanical Installations in the northern province of Normandy, for building six patrol boats equipped with the Franco-Italian missile Automat, while EADS has reached agreement with Libya-Africa Portfolio to establish a military aviation training and maintenance centre. Within the same context, the sources said EADS has reached an agreement in principle with the Libyan Airlines[Afriqiyah] on the purchase of 14 Airbus-319A and Airbus-320A aircraft and six Airbus-330A aircraft. The deal is valued at 1.7bn dollars, which is the biggest deal reaped by the French group in 30 years. The French are seeking to win a major share in the big military projects which Libya is planning for the coming stage and whose total budget is estimated at about 20bn dollars. The sources said that the French government-which hopes to win a share that is not less than 20 per cent of Libya's military deals-has given its approval for the sale of the new Rafale and Tiger aircraft to Libya, but it stipulated that the deals go through the joint ministerial committees that are charged with "studying the export of military hardware". The French believe they have been late in picking the fruits of the changes that occurred with the lifting of the embargo on the export of weapons to Libya two years ago, and they are working on gaining lost time by focusing on the Libyan market. French groups that specialize in military industrialization will participate in the next Tripoli International Fair in which a prototype of the developed Rafale aircraft will be exhibited for the first time. In Paris, a French source who is well informed about the French-Libyan talks has stated to Al-Hayat that the director of international development in the French state organization responsible for armament programs, Jean-Paul Panie, visited Libya about 10 days ago to discuss cooperation between the two countries, and specifically the renewal of some of Libya's Mirage-F1 aircraft and some other military hardware which Libya had bought from France in the past, including outdated but renewable naval vessels. The source said that the armament agreement between the two countries is "gradual". He said that when French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie visited Libya about a year ago, Libyan officials expressed interest in purchasing the Rafale warplane and Tiger helicopters, and that they reaffirmed their desire to conclude a deal to buy those advanced aircraft on more than one occasion. He added that the French made it clear that they have their terms for concluding such deals, and that they are of course interested in concluding deals with Libya and that a deal can be announced during a visit by the Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi to France. However, the source added it will be difficult for the visit to take place before the case of the Bulgarian nurses accused of spreading AIDS among Libyan children is resolved. He said the demand to resolve the nurses case is a demand of the entire EU, and that "the ball is now in Libya's court." Libya is at present holding a retrial of the five nurses following the repeal of a previous sentence that convicted them. The source said that the development and modernization of old equipment and hardware is being studied at present, and that the Libyans are interested in the Rafale and Tiger aircraft, but there are no negotiations at present over the Aster air defence system.

On November 29, 2006, France announced that it will refurbish 12 Libyan Mirage F1 air-defense/multirole fighter aircraft under its first transaction with Libya since Europe lifted arms embargo on Libya in 2004. The contract is worth 140 million euros ($180 million).
