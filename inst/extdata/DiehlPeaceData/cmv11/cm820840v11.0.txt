MID1072

TERRMID: MID1072 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1072 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1072 from cm narrative, the government of The Philippines formally claimed sovereignty over Sabah, a part of Malaysia, and this claim was rejected by Malaysia, Britain, and a UN fact finding mission. Beginning in 1968, a series of small incidents over Sabah took place between Malaysia and the Philippines. Malaysia claimed Filipino insurgents were infiltrating Sabah, and later Malaysia detained a Filipino fishing boat. The Philippines passed a bill including Sabah in the territory of Philippines.

TERRLINK: MID1072 3 -- not third party linked to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1072 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1072

MARITMID: MID1072 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID1072 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID1072 from cm narrative, part of the series of 1968 disputes involved Malaysia detaining a Filipino fishing boat, placing both militaries on high alert. However, this was an incident that was part of the territorial dispute of Sabah, and maritime boundaries were not part of the territorial dispute. Coded maritime because this occurred in disputed waters when a fishing boat entered the disputed area. Likely also connected to the concurrent incidents of TERRMID-1072. 

ISLMID: MID1072 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID1072 1 -- certain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID1072 although part of the rivalry would later involve mutual claims to the Spratley Islands, this dispute had not surfaced at this time and the islands were not a part of MID1072.

CIVWARMID: MID1072 3 -- not civil war
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1072 2 -- somewhat certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1072 from cm narrative, Malaysia claimed during the disputes of MID1072 that Filipino rebels were infiltrating Sabah, the center of the territorial dispute. However, it does not seem to be the case that the insurgency in the Philippines drove any of the minor incidents in MID1072. No attacks by or upon insurgents occurred, no interstate exchanges of fire occurred, and there seems to be no evidence that rebels crossed into Sabah. The claim of insurgent infiltration is most likely diplomatic bluster. From narrative and Keesings (volume 14, December 1968, page 23083), the incidents of MID1072 are as follows: breakdown of Sabah talks via Malaysian walkout, withdrawal of ambassador by Malaysia, Philippines passage of bill claiming Sabah, the Malaysian condemnation of the bill as an act of aggression, and the seizing of a Filipino fishing boat.

CIVWARMID: MID3022 2 -- somewhat connected to civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID3022 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3022 from Gibler 2018, in 1979 Philippine naval vessels violated Malaysian territorial waters while chasing pirates. Malaysia and Philippines both used anti-pirating patrols, but they were not cooperative on policing pirates together and sometimes tensions flared as a result of policing efforts. Coded somewhat connected to civil war because per Gibler 2018, the reason for the mistrust and suspicion between the states was that they suspected each other of supporting militarized rebels within their borders. This MID did not directly involve rebels or civil conflict, but it was a byproduct of militarized rebel activity.

ISLMID-CER: MID3621 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID3621 from cm narrative, the attacks against Filipino targets by Malaysian soldiers occurred on an island belonging to Philippines, Maddanas Island. This was a violation of Filipino sovereignty over the island, but not an attempt to take control of the island. Coded not islands because sovereignty of islands was not in dispute. 

CIVWARMID: MID3621 3 -- not civil war
CIVWARMID-CER: MID3621 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3621 did not concern rebels in Sabah or rebel groups anywhere else, but was related to attacks by Filipino pirates. However, the pirates were not separatists or making a claim against any government or for any territory.

TERRMID: MID2746 3 -- not territorial 
TERRMID-CER: MID2746 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2746 pertains to a dispute over the Spratley Islands and the fishing waters surrounding them. Although MID2746 involves the construction of a naval base at Sabah, a piece of disputed territory around which previous MIDs are centered, the construction of the naval base was not about the territorial issue of Sabah. It was about the maritime issue of the disputed waters around the disputed Spratley Islands. Coded non-territorial because this was only about maritime/Spratley Island issues, not territorial dispute.

MARITMID-CER: MID2746 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID2746 from cm narrative, the Spratley Islands and the surrounding waters are disputed between Malaysia and the Philippines. Malaysia arrested Filipino fishermen, causing a diplomatic dispute that later led to Philippines escorting fishermen in the area of the Spratleys and Malaysia constructing a naval base at Sabah, the disputed territory.

NARRATIVE-CM:

Malaysia and the Philippines disputed sovereignty over Sabah (North Borneo) following the announcement by Britain and Malaya on November 23, 1961 of the planned formation of the Malaysian federation, including the territory of British North Borneo. The Philippines formally claimed sovereignty over the territory on June 22, 1962, but the North Borneo legislative assembly approved the entry of the territory into the proposed federation on September 12, 1962. The countries requested that the *United Nations* (UN) secretary-general appoint a fact-finding mission to determine whether a majority of the people of Sabah favored their integration into the Malaysian federation. The UN fact-finding mission issued a report on September 14, 1963. British North Borneo (Sabah) became a part of the Malaysian federation, which was formed on September 16, 1963. Malaysia and the Philippines severed diplomatic relations on September 17, 1963. Malaysia and the Philippines resumed diplomatic relations on June 3, 1966. Malaysia accused the Philippines of subversion activities in Sabah in March 1968. Indonesia and Thailand, representing the *Association of Southeast Asian Nation* (ASEAN), offered to mediate the dispute, and invited the parties to meetings in Indonesia and Thailand. Thailand mediated negotiations between Malaysian and Philippines representatives in Bangkok from June 17 to July 16, 1968. Philippines reasserted its claim to Sabah on September 18, 1968. Malaysia suspended diplomatic relations with the Philippines on September 19, 1968. The Philippines suggested that the dispute should be submitted to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ), but Malaysia rejected the suggestion. Malaysia and the Philippines resumed diplomatic relations on December 16, 1969. Malaysian military forces attacked and killed some 50 individuals on the island of Maddanas on September 30, 1985. The Philippines renounced its claim to Sabah on August 16, 1988. Philippines protested Malaysia's occupation of the Pawikan Shoal (Terembu Peninjau) in the South China Sea on June 25, 1999. Philippines protested Malaysia's occupation of the Gabriela Silan (Terembu Siput) on August 20, 1999.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Malaysia and the Philippines concerns the control of territory. There are two regions over which the states have disputed, Sabah (North Borneo) and the Spratly Islands. A territorial claim to Sabah was first voiced by the government of the Philippines in 1961, when plans were announced by Britain and Malaya for the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Britain and Malaya and later the Federation of Malaysia rejected this claim. A UN fact-finding mission found that a majority of the population living in Sabah wished to become part of the Federation of Malaysia and the North Borneo Legislative Assembly approved entry into the Federation on September 12, 1962. Diplomatic relations between the states were suspended following the establishment of the new state. In June of 1966 full diplomatic relations were restored between Manila and Kuala Lumpur. In 1968 the Philippine claim to Sabah was revived (MID1072). From April until December of 1968 tensions escalated as a series of small incidents between the states took place. Malaysia claimed that Filipino insurgents were infiltrating Sabah. Malaysia detained a Filipino fishing boat. The militaries of both states were put on alert. In September of 1968, the Philippine Legislature passed a bill including Sabah in the national boundaries of the Republic of the Philippines.

The internal conflict between Southern Filipino Muslims based in Mindanao and Northern Christian leadership in Luzon has a Malaysian connection. Despite statements of intent by President Marcos at the formation of ASEAN in 1967, a final resolution to the Sabah dispute had not been reached in the late 1970s. Malaysian Muslims in Sabah smuggled weapons to the Moro National Liberation Front in Mindanao aiding the rebellious efforts. In the later half of 1980, relations between Malaysia and the Philippines were strained by the use of bases in Sabah by Muslim separatists opposed to the Manila government (MID3117).

On September 23, 1985 Filipino pirates landed at Lahad Datu in north eastern Sabah. They robbed two banks, killed 15 people and attacked a police boat pursuing them. A week later, on September 30, 1985, four Malaysian gunboats and three helicopters attacked a Muslim community on Maddanas Island in the Tawi tawi island group (MID3621). It was variously reported that the attack was in retaliation for the piracy earlier in the week or that the Malaysians were pursuing the pirates. In the attack 53 Filipinos were killed, kidnapped, or wounded.

The second region at the center of the disputes between Malaysia and the Philippines is the Spratly Islands. The islands cover a sea area of more than 250,000 sq. km. and are made up of more than 230 barren islets, reefs, sand bars, and atolls. The Spratly Islands are of strategic interest for three main reasons: they form a vast geographical region located in the middle of strategic areas traversed by commercial shipping traffic in the South China Sea, they are rich in marine resources, and they may contain large under-sea deposits of oil and natural gas. Six nations claim all or part of the Spratly Islands, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Malaysia's claim overlaps that of the other claimants to include the Philippines.

In April 1988 Malaysia seized three Filipino vessels detaining 49 crew off Ardasier Bank near the Commodore and Rizal reefs in the Spratly Islands. They were detained for fishing in Malaysian waters without a permit (MID2746). The area formed part of Malaysia's claimed 200 mile Economic Empowerment Zone EEZ. This prompted vehement Philippine protests. In July, there were sea encounters that prompted Manila to charge Kuala Lumpur with harassing its fishermen. There were calls in the Philippines for the suspension of diplomatic relations when Malaysia moved to try the fishermen. They were later released. Malaysia proceeded to construct a naval base in Sandakan, Sabah while the Philippines' navy began escorting fishermen. Both sides have built up military forces in the area and other incidents occurred. The Philippines even charged Malaysia with shooting at Filipino fishermen. Malaysia has denied this charge. 

Relations between the two ASEAN member states are still tenuous, though not hostile. Piracy occurs in the Sulu-Sulawesi seas area where it is reportedly mixed with the political activities of the Moro National Liberation Front. MNLF personnel allegedly shake down vessels to obtain finance. The interstate rivalry between Malaysia and the Philippines hamper coordinated approaches to the problem. Cooperation exists between Indonesia and Malaysia but no joint patrols are conducted by Malaysia and the Philippines.

In 2002 a Philippine legislator warned that the mass deportation of Filipino illegal immigrants by Malaysia and widespread allegations of maltreatment were straining relations between the two countries. Concern over the deportation of Filipinos living in Malaysia has renewed interest in Philippine claims on Sabah. 

While the Philippines has considered formally dropping its claim to Sabah on multiple occasions it has not done so as yet (2003). The Philippines continues to claim Sabah as part of its territory. Efforts of the Philippine government to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice have failed because of the opposition of Malaysia. Under the Statute of the World Court, its jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties, and Malaysia has not agreed to be sued.

Note. I had difficulty finding information on MID3022 19791115 to 19791119. I looked in the New York Times, the Times of London, and a Lexus Nexus search on World News isolating on Asia. I also checked Facts on File, and did a web search using the dates and the two country names as search terms in Google. In doing the newspaper searches I extended the date parameters to a month after the MID date. I also checked the text sources listed below in Sources-CR. I found no reference to a specific incident between the two states in the specified period.
