After the ICJ awarded disputed territory to Chad, Libya fortified troops in the Aozou strip area. The ICJ criticized Libya's actions. First day of dispute was on 2/14/1994 and last day of dispute was on 5/31/1994.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Chad and Libya disputed the sovereignty of the Aouzou strip in northern Chad following the independence of Chad from France on August 11, 1960 (Libya claimed the territory as a result of an un-ratified treaty signed between France and Italy on January 7, 1935). But even after Chad's independence in 1960, many northerners still identified more closely with people in Libya than with the southern-dominated government in N'Djamena. Libya did offer sanctuary to the Tebu rebels who were fighting against the Chadian government during the 1960s. Libyan involvement with Chad started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the two sides of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.[1]After seizing power in 1969, Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi reasserted Libya's claim to the Aozou Strip, a 100,000-square-kilometer portion of northern Chad that included the small town of Aozou. Libya based its claim on one of several preindependence agreements regarding colonial boundaries, and it bolstered these claims by stationing troops in the Aozou Strip beginning in 1972. (Maps printed in Libya after 1975 included the Aozou Strip within Libya.)Chad severed diplomatic relations with Libya on August 28, 1971 following an unsuccessful rebellion against President Tombalbaye. Libya denied involvement in the attempted rebellion on August 29, 1971. Libya officially recognized the *Front pour la Liberation Nationale du Tchad* (FROLINAT) on September 17, 1971, and allowed the rebel group to open offices in Tripoli. President Hamani Diori of Niger offered to mediate the dispute on September 18, 1971, and Chad and Libya immediately agreed to the mediation offer. President Hamani Diori of Niger mediated negotiations between representatives of Chad and Libya in Niamey from April 1-12, 1972. The countries agreed to resume diplomatic relations on April 12, 1972. Libyan troops occupied the Aouzou strip in April 1972, and the government of Chad agreed to cede the territory to Libya on November 28, 1972. Libya formally annexed the territory in June 1973, but did not announce the annexation until September 1975. President Felix Malloum (who had seized power on April 14, 1975) denounced Libya on April 26, 1976 for having illegally occupied the Aozou strip. Chad closed its border with Libya on October 16, 1976. Libyan troops intervened in support of FROLINAT rebels in northern Chad in June 1977. *Organization of African Unity* (OAU) heads-of-state established a conciliation commission (Algeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal) on July 5, 1977. Chad severed diplomatic relations with Libya, and referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council on February 6, 1978.

President Jafar Muhammad Numaryi of Sudan appealed for the withdrawal of Libyan troops from Chad on December 20, 1980 and June 26, 1981. On November 16, 1981, Libyan troops completed their withdrawal from Chad after General Goukouni Oueddei requested the troop withdrawal on October 30, 1981. On September 13, 1982, the foreign minister of Chad declared that his country would attempt to expel Libyan troops from the Aozou strip, but Libya reaffirmed its sovereignty over the territory on September 20, 1982. Chad referred the matter to the UN Security Council on March 17, 1983. The UN Security Council appealed for peaceful negotiations on April 6, 1983. France decided to provided military assistance to Chad on June 26, 1983, and French military aircraft airlifted emergency military assistance (anti-tank weapons) to Chad beginning on June 27, 1983, and Zaire deployed 1,750 troops in support of Chad beginning on July 3, 1983. The OAU appealed for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Chad on July 15, 1983. Libyan military aircraft attacked targets in northern Chad on July 31-August 3, 1983. The United States and Zaire jointly condemned Libyan aggression against Chad on August 4, 1983. The US deployed two AWACS (surveillance planes) and eight F-15s (fighter planes) in support of Chad between August 8 and August 23, 1983.

Libya did offer sanctuary to the Tebu rebels who were fighting against the Chadian government during the 1960s. Libya's king Idris had a personal guard formed out of soldiers of Tebu background and this made him offer sanctuary to anti-Chadian Tebu movements. Officially though the relations between Libya and Tombalbaye's government in Chad were neutral and several agreements over communications and the status of Chadian workers in Libya were signed in 1969.

On June 5, 1994, Chad and Libya signed a treaty of friendship which aimed to put an end to the 20 years conflict over the Aozou Strip. The signing of the treaty became possible after Libya recognized ICJ's earlier ruling in favor of Chad. The President of Chad made an official visit to Tripoli at the head of a large Chadian delegation. The issue of Aozou Strip never came back to haunt the relations between Chad and Libya. The prime ministers of Libya and Chad attended talks on the expansion of bilateral relations in the northern Libyan town of Sirte on September 3, 1995. Libyan radio said Libyan Prime Minister Abd Al-Majid Al-Qaud and his Chadian counterpart Koibla Djimasata were present as the Higher Joint Committee discussed increasing trade, the implementation of previous agreements in various spheres, and a general upgrading of relations. Other ministers were also present at the meeting, the radio report said. On February 21, 1997, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has held a meeting with visiting Chad Interior Minister Mahamat Nimir Hamata to discuss improving relations between the neighboring countries. Libya and Chad were at odds for more than two decades over ownership of the Aozou strip, a mineral-rich area on their frontier. The presence of Libyan forces in the strip, and their intervention on behalf of anti-government Chad rebels, prompted France to send forces to Chad in 1986 to keep the Libyans at bay. The International Court of Justice at the Hague, the Netherlands, in 1994 awarded the disputed area to Chad, and Libya withdrew its troops. BBC reports said Hamata gave Gadhafi a message from Chad President Idriss Deby expressing ''Chad's solidarity with Libya and its desire to develop relations between the two fraternal peoples.'' After the resolution of the Aozou strip dispute, Libya and Chad signed a treaty of friendship in June 1994. On November 23, 1998, Chad and Libya have officially opened two of their common border posts in Sarra (extreme south of Libya) and Ouniyanga (extreme north of Chad) to facilitate the free movement of their nationals.The opening ceremony was presided by the secretary (minister) of the Libyan General People's Committee for Security, Mohammed Hijazi, and the Chadian Minister of interior and security, Omar Djibril. According to Libyan television, the opening of the two border posts is in line with the "strengthening of relations of fraternity and good neighborliness between Chad and Libya." The two countries have maintained excellent relations since President Idriss Deby came to power in 1990 and the settlement of their dispute over the Oouzou strip of land by the International Court of Justice at the Hague in 1994. They are both members of the Sahel-Saharan States, an organization which was established in 1997 by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadhafi. Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Sudan are also members of the organization. Chad and Libya signed a cooperation accord on security in November 1997, which provides for the establishment of a joint bilateral technical commission to facilitate the free movement of people and goods between the two countries. The accord also provides for the opening of a Libyan Consular Service in Faya, headquarters of the Northern province of Chad, and a Chadian Consular Service in Sebha, capital of the southern region of Libya.

The Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi, arrived in N'djamena on February 3, 2000, on a three-day visit to Chad where he will attend the second summit of the community of Sahelian-Saharan states. Kadhafi expressed happiness to be in N'djamena for the summit of the organization which "represents a huge stride on the path of African unity..." "Our presence in N'djamena means that we have started a new stage and a new era for Africa," he added. "We have opened a new page, after turning another one which is rich with lessons that we will take inspiration from for the unity of Africa." The Central African Republic, Eritrea, Libya, Mali, Niger and Sudan comprise the community, which aims at setting up an economic union capable of guaranteeing peace, security and stability in member countries. The N'djamena summit follows that held in April 1999 the north-eastern Libyan city of Sirte.

On March 7, 2000, the Chadian leader has commended Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadhafi's resolve to help restore peace and stability in his country. In a message delivered by foreign minister Mohammed Salah Nadhif, President Idriss Deby said "Colonel Kadhafi's efforts and concern for stability and security in Chad" were commendable. Kadhafi had proposed in November 1999, to help resolve the dispute between the government and the rebel-held north, under siege of former defence minister Youssouf Togoimi.Fighting intensified in the Tibesti between the government army and Togoimi's Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad, following the failure of several mediation attempts in a bid to circumvent the Chadian conflict. The Libyan leader has always reiterated that Tripoli "would not tolerate its territory be used to destabilize Chad." Member countries of the Sahelo-Sahelian States also committed themselves during their second conference in February that they would not provide any assistance to rebels. The community comprises, in addition to Libya and Chad which is assuming the chairmanship of the organization, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Eritrea, Senegal, Djibouti and Gambia.

Prime Minister of Chad Nagoum Yamassoum Albert and the delegation accompanying him on April 27, 2002, left Tripoli after an official visit to Libya. The Chadian prime minister was seen off by the secretary of the General People's Committee prime minister and a number of coordinators of the people's social leaderships of Libya. The Chadian prime minister made a statement to the Jamahiriyah news agency, Jana, in which he lauded the results of his visit to Libya. He said: The visit offered us the opportunity to discuss all aspects of bilateral cooperation. He added that this visit was successful and led to the setting up of a committee of experts in order to consolidate all aspects of cooperation between the two countries.

Chadian President Idriss Deby left for neighboring Libya on October 5, 2002, to discuss the sending of a regional joint military force to the Central African Republic (CAR) and the situation in Chad following the death of a rebel leader, official sources said. The visit follows an agreement by central African leaders last week to send a 300-strong joint military mission to CAR, Chad's southern neighbor, within the next month to help ease tensions along the border between the two countries. "The presence of these soldiers in the sub-region will signal the departure of Libyan troops from the CAR," a Chadian presidential source said, explaining that countries in the region were concerned at the Libyan presence. "Given its close ties to Libya, Chad will inform Tripoli of these concerns," the source added referring to the intervention of Libyan soldiers, ostensibly to protect CAR President Felix Patasse, following a coup attempt against him in May last year. Chad, which has been concerned about this military presence, said recently it had been told by Tripoli that the Libyan contingent would soon be withdrawn-a statement denied by CAR authorities. The sources also said Deby would be discussing with Moamer Kadhafi the government's rapprochment with the rebel Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJT) following the death in Libya of its leader, Youssouf Togoimi. "The parents of the deceased would like to see him laid to rest in his native Tibesti region (in northern Chad), but the Libyans are opposed to transferring his remains pending the prior agreement of the (Chadian) government authorities," said a diplomatic source. However, the source said it was unlikely the Deby government would agree following a rebel attack on Faya airport, gateway to the Tibesti region which border's Libya and which is the main heartland of the MDJT rebellion.

On December 14, 2003, Libya gave Chad 1.7 million USD to ensure food security in various regions of Chad. This was done in the context of FAO's food security program, emerged from the World Food Summit of 1996. On December 24, 2006, Libya played the role of mediator in a ceasefire agreement signed by the Chadian government with one of the rebel groups, the Chadian United Front for Democratic Change, trying to overthrow it.
