TERRLINK-NOTES: MID21 from Gibler (2018), Austria did not want Serbia (Yugoslavia) to have access to the Adriatic via a port in Albania that Austria controlled. Russia supported Serbia's access, and Austria and Serbia mobilized troops over this issue. Russia eventually backed down. Coded somewhat third party link to territory because Serbia and Russia were not disputing Austria's sovereignty over the port, but they were asserting that Serbia should have the right to travel through Austria's territory to access the Adriatic Sea.
