MARITMID-NOTES: MID3217 South Vietnam and Philippines had conflicting maritime boundaries stemming from their mutual claim on the Spratly islands and the islands' surrounding waters, which were (and still are) believed to be oil-rich.

ISLMID-CER: MID3217 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID3217 per the Schultz MID data, this MID involved a series of landings by S Vietnam on islands in the Spratley archipelago. The South Vietnam-Philippines dispute was centered on the Spratley Islands archipelago and the rights to the minerals present in the islands' surrounding waters. Reuters reports MID3217 occurred in 1975, but Schultz has it as 1974. Coded islands MID because the Spratleys are disputed by these two countries and the disputed islands were occupied by S Vietnam.
