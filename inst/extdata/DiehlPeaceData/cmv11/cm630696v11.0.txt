TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3617 from Gibler 2018, in 1984 Iran attacked two Saudi oil tankers in the Persian Gulf that it suspected of carrying oil from Iraq. Iran also threatned other Gulf states that they would use force to close the Persian Gulf if Iraq did not stop its attacks on Iran. Iran routinely attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil during the Iran-Iraq War as a means of harming Iraq's economy. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2587 from Gibler 2018, in 1986 Iran issued a threat to the Persian Gulf states that it would block the Strait of Hormuz, an important strait for oil transport. Iran was attempting to block ships from trading with Iraq in an attempt to harm Iraq's economy.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID2795 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, A UAE vessel struck an Iranian mine in the Gulf of Oman. Coded maritime because the countries were disputing a maritime boundary in the Gulf of Oman at the time (Al Neyadi 1997), and coded uncertain because GML argue this MID should be dropped. There is no evidence that Iran placed the mine there to damage UAE ships.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID3567 Ownership of Abu Musa island carries maritime border delimitation implications (Al Neyadi 1997). The maritime border in this area is also unsettled. For these reasons, we code the dispute as maritime as well.

ISLMID-NOTES: MID3567 from Gibler 2018, Iran and UAE shared sovereignty over an island that was rich in oil resources. In 1992, Iran took over the island, claiming it as its own. UAE did not resist. Coded islands MID because Iran asserted sovereignty over an island here.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4521 from Gibler 2018, in 2004 UAE seized an Iranian fishing vessel. According to Henderson (2004), this occurred near the island Abu Musa, which was disputed largely for its maritime boundary implications. Thus, this is related to a disputed maritime boundary. Iran responded by seizing UAE vessels. Coded maritime because the countries were disputing a maritime boundary.

USE OF FORCE 

On June 3, 2004, Emirati naval forces fired upon and seized an Iranian fishing boat that it claimed was operating in its territorial waters. Iran protested the incident, claiming that the Emirati boat crossed into Iranian waters. As a reprisal, Iran seized six Emirati fishing boats on June 13. All of the fishermen and boats were released by both sides on July 1. First day of dispute was on 6/3/3004 and last day of dispute was on 7/1/2004.

RIVNOTES: We have two isolated rivalries. The first four disputes, RIV11196, are related to the Iran-Iraq war and are one isolated conflict. MID 3567, RIV21196, is its own isolated rivalry.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) disputed the sovereignty of the islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb, and Lesser Tunb after Iran occupied the islands on November 30, 1971. Iraq imposed diplomatic sanctions (suspension of diplomatic relations) against Iran on November 30, 1971. The UAE Council of Ministers condemned the occupation of the islands on December 2, 1971. Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and South Yemen referred the matter to the *United Nations* (UN) Security Council. The UN Security Council discussed the dispute on December 9, 1971. Iraq demanded the withdrawal of Iranian troops from the disputed islands on October 31, 1979, but Iran rejected the demand on November 1, 1979. Qatar offered to mediate negotiations between Iran and UAE, but Iran rejected the mediation offer on July 10, 1995. Qatar facilitated negotiations between representatives from Iran and United Arab Emirates on November 17-21, 1995. The *League of Arab States* (LAS) foreign ministers expressed support for the UAE on September 13, 1999. The *Gulf Cooperation Council *(GCC) expressed support for the UAE, and condemned Iran on December 31, 2000.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) occurs primarily within the context of the Iran-Iraq War. Of the five mids that constitute the rivalry, only one exists outside the domain of the Iran-Iraq War. There is also an issue of the sovereignty over three islands that are strategically situated in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf. The dispute between Iran and the UAE over these islands (described below) dates from the early 1970s. 

Initially, the fighting between Iran and Iraq only peripherally affected the Persian Gulf states. In May 1981, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE banded together in the GCC to protect their interests and, if necessary, to defend themselves (Gulf Cooperation Council). In 1984, Iran reacted to Iraqi air attacks on Iran's main oil terminal on the island of Khark by attacking ships destined for ports in gulf countries that assisted Iraq's war effort. Iranian links with a coup attempt in Bahrain in 1981, Shia terrorist activity in Kuwait, and Iranian inspired violence in Mecca underscored the conviction of the Arab states of the gulf that Iran was the primary threat to their security. 

MID3617 occurred from May of 1984 until July. This is a multilateral mid involving Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia vs. Iran. Here the issue is the war between Iran and Iraq. Iraq is receiving support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in its war against Iraq. Iran wants to limit that support. They do so by bombing Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf and making it clear that they are doing so in response to the Saudi support of the Iraqis. They widen the bombing to include tankers of all the gulf states. On 5/17/1984 Iranian war planes bombed a Saudi oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. This was the fifth such attack in a three week period. On May 21, 1984 an Iranian newspaper suggested that Iran's air force bomb power stations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to force them to stop supporting Iraq in its war with Iran. Iraq is also bombing Iranian tankers or tankers flagged with other countries that attempt to take on oil at Iranian ports. 

MID2587 is a multilateral mid involving Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait vs. Iran. This is a one day mid taking place on 8/29/1986. Here again the motivation for this mid is the squeeze Iran was trying to put on other gulf states in an effort to bleed Iraq dry of cash. Here Iran threatened to close the Gulf of Hormuz that would effectively cut off access to the Persian Gulf and cripple the oil exporting capacity of the Gulf States. 

MID2795 took place on 8/15/1987. Here a mine set by the Iranian navy detonated as a ship owned by a UAE company collided with it just outside the Persian Gulf. 

MID2752 occurred on April 14, 1988. Iranian speedboats attacked a UAE flagged tanker in the Persian Gulf. The Iranians fired on the tanker and set it on fire. The Omani navy came to the assistance of the tanker and no one was injured. 

MID3567 occurred in April of 1992. Iran expelled Arab residents of the small island Abu Musa. Abu Musa is one of the three small islands in the Persian Gulf that the two countries jointly administered. A dispute has existed between Iran and the UAE over the islands that are strategically situated at the entrance to the Persian (Arabian) Gulf. As of June of 2003, Iran continued to occupy the islands and the UAE continued to press Iran to shift its position and revert to a shared sovereignty over the three islands. Though Iran continues to occupy the islands, there has not been a militarized dimension to the conflict since the expulsions of 1992. 

Thus, there exists some ambiguity as to whether this rivalry is concluded or not. As noted above, the bulk of the mids occur within the context of the Iran-Iraq War. With the close of that conflict in August of 1988, Iranian military pressure on the UAE in an effort to dry up support for Iraq ceased. However, the dispute over the three islands in the gulf that existed prior to and after the Iran-Iraq War continues to be a point of irritation between the two countries.
