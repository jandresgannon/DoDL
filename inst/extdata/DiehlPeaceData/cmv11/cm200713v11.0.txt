NARRATIVE-CR:
In 1949, after the PLA victory on the Chinese mainland, the ROC vacated to Formosa. To put pressure on the PRC, the ROC in Taiwan instituted a blockade. It informed the UK, the US, and other trading nations that ships found in harbors of the PRC would run the risk of attack, mine damage or other hazards. The ROC was particularly concerned with preventing strategic supplies from entering the PRC. The US barred all trade with the PRC in support of this blockade but the UK barred only strategic material trade with the PRC. Thus British ships ran the Formosa Straits in efforts to reach trading ports with the PRC. The disputes that make up the rivalry between the UK and the ROC thus have a similar character to the disputes associated with the Tanker War between Iran and Iran. Both Iran or Iraq have a number of short lower level rivalries (or a string of disputes embedded in larger rivalries) that are related to preventing their opponent from trading in oil during the Iran-Iraq War. This blockade resulted in a series of disputes between the UK and Taiwan that lasted until 1955. 

MID2007 occurred from October 18 to November 16, 1949. In June 1949, the ROC declared a "closure" of all mainland ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships, mainly of British and Soviet-bloc origin. Since the mainland's railroad network was underdeveloped, north-south trade heavily depended on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland fishermen. During this period the ROC detained at least one British Ship near Foochow. The ROC Navy allowed the ship to proceed after the British frigate Whitesand Bay intervened. 

MID2008 occurred from June 5 to July 15 1950. This dispute was a part of the ROC blockade of PRC ports. British ship (the Cloverlock) was shelled near Amoy on 12 July 1950. This was a part of the ROC blockade of PRC ports. 

MID2992 occurred from March 18, 1951 to May 22, 1951. On two occasions the British embassy in Tansui (or Tamshui) was attacked. On one occasion a British unit was attacked. On another the Consulate was attacked. 

On February 9, 1952, the Chinese Communist government accused Churchill of siding with the Kuomintang leadership in Taiwan, following his trip to Washington. 

MID2990 was a use of force by Taiwan against the UK that occurred on October 25, 1952. I was not able to locate any information on this dispute. 

MID2988 occurred from May 24 until 11/25/1953. On July 27, 1953 Chinese Nationalist forces fired on the British ship the Inchkilda near the island of Ochkeu. It was then stopped and eventually released the same day. On August 17, the British ship Nigelock was stopped by a Chinese Nationalist ship in the Formosa Straits. The British frigate St. Brides Bay intervened and the ROC ship sailed without incident. 

MID2037 is coded as occurring on 11/19/1955. This may be a mistake. There is nothing reported as occurring in the Times of London or the New York Times on or near this date. The ROC threatened to use its veto power on the UN Security Council on 29 November in opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia to the UN. This is the closest item to the coded dispute found near the event. The dispute is coded as an ROC attack (a 16 in the highest action taken variable). 

There are a number of political distractions for both the UK and the ROC that could serves as factors to dislodge the rivalry between the UK and the ROC. Among the international factors are the end of the Korean War in 1953. In 1955, US President Eisenhower signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with the ROC promising to protect Taiwan in the event of a PRC invasion. In 1956, the UK was involved in the Suez Crisis. Within the UK, several events transpired in association with the termination of the rivalry. In 1955, Winston Churchill resigned from the post of Prime Minister. Churchill handed over to fellow Conservative Anthony Eden. In May, the country went to the polls and the Conservatives were voted back into power. Anthony Eden stayed as Prime Minister with a sizable majority. Churchill stayed on as an MP until 1963. In 1957, PM Eden resigned form his post due to ill health. His anxiety condition was worsened by the Suez Crisis. In 1958, the British engaged in the Cod Wars with Iceland. Britain's fishermen were angered by aggressive fishing tactics being used by trawlers from Iceland. British ships were being shot at to force them away from fishing grounds. The government complained to Iceland about the incidents. So basically Britain was involved in more serious conflicts than the skirmishes with Taiwan over trading with mainland China. As for Taiwan, they too had a number of issues domestically that could serve as factors in the termination of the rivalry. The issues that On September 3, 1954 Communist Chinese forces bombarded Quemoy island, under Nationalist control, with artillery. The US Seventh Fleet moved to defensive positions around the Quemoy. The Communists would continue to bombard Quemoy periodically from 1954 to 1964. The Battle of Tachen Islands occurred from 1954 to 1955, and the Battle of the Taiwan Strait occurred on August 23, 1958. These were both fierce fights between ROC and communist forces. The ROC's very existence faced a constant and very serious military threat. Although there were some sporadic skirmishes and minor sea battles after the Battle of the Taiwan Strait, political tensions between the two sides gradually eased and the frequency of direct military clashes slowly subsided after 1965.

The last MID of RIV476, MID2037 ended on January 19th, 1955. In 1950, the UK switched recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China (PRC), while maintaining the British Consulate in Tamsui, through which the UK continued to carry out consular and trade-related activities. The Consulate was closed after the UK and the PRC upgraded relations to Ambassadorial level on March 13, 1972, and in June 1980 the building and land of the Consulate were returned to the Taiwanese government. The Taiwanese government's office in the UK was set up in September 1963, and at the time was known as the Free Chinese Centre. On 15 April 1992, this was revised to become the Taipei Representative Office in the UK.

In February 1976, the UK established the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee in Taiwan with the aim of promoting the UK's trade interests with Taiwan, and in June 1989 the Committee set up within it a Visa Handling Unit. In November 1985, a British trade delegation visited Taiwan and expressed its hope that Taiwanese businesses will also invest in Britain. 

On November 5, 1990, the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee held a consultative meeting. Representatives discussed the environment protection, mass transportation and shipping, chemicals and pharmaceutics. UK and Taiwan signed a joint agreement during the plenary session. The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Taiwan Automobile Industry Association also signed a pact pledging to increase information and technological exchanges. 

On July 29, 1991, Taiwanese and British officials kicked off two days of trade consultations in the first inter-governmental talks in Taipei since the British government recognized China in 1950. Discussions between the two sides, which conducted roughly $3 billion in two-way trade in 1990, focused on British demands for lowering of tariffs on Scotch whisky, and a Taiwan request that the British government support the island's application for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
U.K. delegation leader R.J. Meadway, an under secretary for overseas trade at the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry, the highest ranking British offficial to visit Taipei in decades said Taiwan, ''on trade grounds should be permitted to join GATT.'' 

Philip Morrice, newly appointed director of the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee in Taipei, arrived on May 25, 1992, to assume his post. Formerly the deputy chief of the British Embassy in Brazil, Morrice succeeds David Pointon whose tenure of office here will expire soon. Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said that relations between Taiwan and the United Kingdom have been cordial in recent years. High-ranking British officials visited Taipei in 1991, and the name of Taiwan's representative office in London was changed last month from "Free China Center" to "The Taipei Representative Office in UK" to more clearly reflect its functions. With two-way trade reaching US$ 3.2 billion in 1991, Britain has become Taiwan's second largest trading partner in Europe, second only to Germany. All these are signs pointing to closer ties between Taiwan and Britain. 

Raymond Tai, the ROC Representative to UK, pointed out on March 4, 1993, that ROC-UK trade has grown significantly over the past three years (1990-1992) to reach US$ 3.54 billion in 1992. In addition, over 50,000 ROC tourists visited Britain and 30,000 Britons came to Taiwan in 1992. He further added that Britain is the first Western country to send a career diplomat as its representative in Taipei, adding that with London's "Hong Kong concern" going away after 1997 future ROC-UK ties will surely be more promising. 

In October 1993, the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee and the UK Education Centre merged together, and the resultant body was named the British Trade and Cultural Office. British trade official Richard Needham said the UK will 'try to ride three horses at the same time' in an attempt to improve trade relations with Taiwan. Speaking in Taipei where he attended ceremonies to mark upgrading the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee to a full British Trade and Cultural Office, Mr Needham conceded the trick is not easy. Mr Needham, minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry, said: 'Britain is particularly sensitive in relations with Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.' But, he added: 'Taiwan has enormous prospects for British business.' The British trade official's visit, and the upgrading of the unofficial trade committee to representative office status, is part of a bilateral bid to bolster faltering trade between the two countries.

On November 25, 1994, Republic of China Representative to Britain Eugene Chien urged Taiwan manufacturers to increase investment in northern England to facilitate their entry into the European market and the 51 British Commonwealth member states. He further pointed out that the number of Taiwan students pursuing advanced studies in the United Kingdom has increased rapidly in recent years. "I believe this trend will be an advantage for future development of Taiwan-British trade and economic relations," Chien said, citing as evidence that a large number of US-trained Taiwan engineers, technocrats and other professionals have helped boost Taiwan-American ties during past years. According to British government tallies, there are currently more than 8,000 Taiwan students engaged in graduate studies in Britain.

In January 1996, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a visit to Taiwan. She also visited Taiwan in 1992, 2 years after she left office. During her visit she met with President Lee Teng-hui. 

A strong manufacturing infrastructure and many other incentives have made the United Kingdom the top investment destination for Taiwan companies eager to develop markets in Europe in 1998. About 80 percent of the Taiwan manufacturing enterprises that have invested in Europe are located in the United Kingdom, according to Majestic Trading Co., Ltd., a representative arm of Taiwan's Economics Ministry in London. In addition to the United Kingdom's sound infrastructure and solid investment incentives, Taiwan's investors are also attracted to that country because of its use of English-the internationally accepted language for business, Majestic noted. 

The British government offers regional selective assistance to foreign and domestic companies that invest in certain areas of the United Kingdom which are facing serious unemployment problems or a decline in the traditional industries. 
The major criteria for deciding the subsidy amount for each investor are the number of jobs the project will create and the expected benefits for the British economy. This financial incentive can run as high as 40 percent of the project's total investment capital. 

As of the end of 1997, a total of 89 Taiwan enterprises had invested more than US$ 494 million in the United Kingdom, according to Berton Chiu, managing director of Majestic. Of these companies, 53 invested in the electronics industry. The remaining firms concentrated their investments in the financial and transportation sectors. 

On July 22, 1999, Taiwanese Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang said the United Kingdom will support Taiwan's bid for membership in the World Trade Organization.Wang currently is on a visit in the United Kingdom, and he made the statement after he met with British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen Byers and Junior Minister for Trade and Industry Brain Wilson. The main mission for this trip is to promote business exchanges with European countries, Wang said, adding that if people ask him about the arguable "state-to-state theory," he would tell them that Taiwan's policies on mainland China remain unchanged and that Taiwan's stance is also unchanged. Wang said Wilson was impressed by Taiwan's economic development after he visited Taiwan in March 1999, and UK economic officials remain highly interested in the possibility of setting up a negotiation channel with Taiwan, as well as arranging mutual visits by high-ranking officials. Taiwan-UK trade totaled US$5 billion in 1998, and these kinds of talks are expected to strengthen bilateral trade exchanges, Wang noted. There have been 79 investment projects worth a combined US$329 million in the United Kingdom by Taiwan businessmen, while UK investment in Taiwan has totaled 150 projects worth US$960 million, which puts the United Kingdom second among European countries in terms of its investment in Taiwan.
T
aiwanese President Chen Shui-bian asked on June 21, 2002, that UK stop blocking Taiwan's membership bid to the World Health Organization. He gave several economic reasons why UK should support Taiwan. "The UK is Taiwan's third largest trade partner in Europe and two-way trade between two countries topped 4.77bn US dollars last year," Chen said. "More importantly, the United Kingdom has the largest amount of Taiwanese investment, worth about 400m dollars."

The UK minister of state at the UK's Department of Trade, Alan Johnson's visit comes less than a month after the UK's minister of small business met with Taiwanese officials to discuss the new bidding process. Undeterred by fears over severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the second UK trade minister to visit Taiwan in less than a month is expected to arrive in late April 2003. During a two-day visit, he will meet with British business representatives and lobby top Taiwanese Cabinet officials on behalf of UK firms bidding for government projects, Derek Marsh, British Trade and Cultural Office director general
Taiwan's image is not strong in the United Kingdom and there is a lot of room for improvement, UK parliamentarian Lord Richard Faulkner of Worcester said on January 4, 2006 in Taipei. A 15-member British parliamentary delegation led by Faulkner, co-chairman of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, arrived in Taiwan for a five-day visit on January 2, 2006. The delegation met President Chen Shui-bian on 3 January, 2006. Edgar Lin, representative of the ROC to the UK, accompanied the delegation to Taiwan. The trip was the result of the efforts he made in solidifying bilateral relations since he took over the post in 2005. "There's a lot of room for improvement in promoting Taiwan's image in the UK. Taiwan is capable of producing such high quality products. The situation is not the same as it was 20 years ago," Faulkner said. He added that the label "made in Taiwan" should be perceived by the consumer as a symbol of both quality and the country's image. Faulkner, who is on his fourth visit to the island, said that the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group is the biggest one in the British parliament and it shows how much interest and support there is for Taiwan. Mentioning the content of the meeting their delegation had with President Chen Shui-bian, Faulkner said that they spoke on Taiwan's role in the world economy, Taiwan applying to take part in the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer, liberalization of trade with China and bilateral tourism exchanges as well as both countries' relations in various aspects."The weakness in the Taiwan-British relationship is the China-first policy that the UK has adopted," he said. 

The British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group was established in 1976 and enjoys close ties with the Taipei Representative Office in the UK. 1976 seems to be a turning point in getting the relations between UK and Taiwan closer with the establishment of the Anglo-Taiwan Trade Committee and of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group in the British Parliament.
