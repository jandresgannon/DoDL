Territorial-Maritime-Boundary Issues Variables

MID1666 

TERRMID: MID1666 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1666 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID1666 1 -- third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1666 3 -- uncertain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1666 Honduras feared an invasion from El Salvador and requested that the US send a warship to assist its defense (Gibler 2018). The border remained unsettled at the time, but coded uncertain because it is unclear whether the issue concerned the border, ongoing attempts of Central American States to foment revolution in one another’s territory, or some combination of the two (Munro p. 122-3).

MARITMID: MID1666 3 -- not maritime 
MARITMID-CER: MID1666 1 -- certain
MARITMID-NOTES: 

ISLMID: MID1666 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID1666 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: 

CIVWARMID: MID1666 3 -- not civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1666 3 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1666 At the time of this MID, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua often each supported armed activities against the other Central American states’ governments. In this context, there were “frequent reports of impending invasions” — particularly between Nicaragua and Honduras (Munro p.123). Coded not civil war because there appears to be relative stability in Salvador (Gould and Lauria-Santiago 2008, p.35-36) around the time of this MID. Coded uncertain because it is not clear whether the threat of invasion concerned territory or the ongoing policy (at the time) of states interfering in one another’s rebellions. 

CIVWARLINK: MID1666 1 -- not civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1666 3 -- uncertain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: At the time of this MID, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua are facing internal rebellion, supported by the activities of the other Central American states. In this context, there were “frequent reports of impending invasions” — particularly between Nicaragua and Honduras (Munro p.123). Coded civil war because Honduras repeatedly faced rebellions around this time, and Salvador appears to be involved (UCA.edu; Munro p. 118). Nicaragua, in contrast, seems stable around the time of the MID (Boot 2002). Coded uncertain because it is not clear whether the threat of invasion concerned territory or the ongoing policy (at the time) of states interfering in one another’s rebellions.

COUPMID: MID1666 3 -- not coup 
COUPMID-CER: MID1666 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: 

COUPLINK: MID1666 3 -- not coup link
COUPLINK-CER: MID1666 1 -- certain
