TERRMID-NOTES: MID4306 from cm narrative, Central African Republic occupied part of Cameroon's territory. Cameroon acknowledges the occupation, urging its citizens to ignore the troops, but does not respond with military force. Coded not territory because while cm narrative says this was connected to an ongoing border dispute, Huth and Allee 2002 have this dispute as not active during the time of this MID. Owsiak also shows the border settled before this MID.
