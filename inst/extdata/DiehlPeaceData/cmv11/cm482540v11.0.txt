CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from Gibler 2018, Zaire was experiencing civil war, and the rebels were being supported by Angola and Cuba. Several countries offered assistance to Zaire to defend against the rebels, pulling them into this MID against Cuba and Angola. Coded civil war link because this was connected to a civil war in Zaire, outside this dyad. CAR was one of the countries to offer assistance to Zaire, placing it on the opposite side from Angola in the dispute.
