TERRMID: MID3561 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID3561 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3561 from Gibler 2018, after Georgian independence from Russia, Georgia faced separatist rebels, and a civil war erupted. Russia supported the rebels in an attempt to impose costs on Georgia to coerce them into joining the Commomwealth of Independent States (CIS), an international organization made of former Soviet republics. Eventually, Goergia conceded by joining the CIS, and Russia helped suppress the rebellion. Coded not territory because this was connected to a dispute concerning Georgia's membership in an international organization, not a boundary dispute.

Russia and Georgia engage in several militarized incidents over the South Ossetia/Abkhazia issue, culminating in the 2008 Russia-Georgia War. The war resulted from a Georgian attempt to retake South Ossetia. Russia launched a counter-offensive in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, ultimately driving Georgian forces from each region. The conflict did not produce one- thousand battlefield deaths, and it is, therefore, not coded as a war. While the bulk of hostilities were short-lived, the two states continued to engage in militarized incidents through 2010, typically over Russian land-holdings in the region following the war. While Russia attained a clear military victory during the 2008 war, the underlying issue over the rule of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains unresolved, and the dispute is thus coded as ending in a stalemate. First day of dispute 8/6/2007 and last day of dispute was on 9/24/2010.

The background of the dispute is that Chechen rebels had occupied two strategic gorges in Georgia, which Georgia appeared to be powerless to halt. Russia asked the Georgian government for permission to conduct attacks on those gorges and to use Georgian territory to facilitate further activity. Georgia refused this request. Nevertheless, Russian helicopters, gunships, and warplanes made several attacks on Chechen rebels near the Georgian-Chechen border, with some of the attacks taking place on Georgian territory. Georgia protested the attacks. First day of dispute was on 11/17/1999 and last day of dispute was on 3/14/2001.

NARRATIVE-CM:

MID3561 lasted from June 13, 1992 to October 26, 1993. This is the conflict over Abkhazia during which Russia intervened with forces to support the Russian population in the break-away republic of Abkhazia, inside Georgian territory.

MID4096 lasted from August 25, 1997 to December 23, 1997. This dispute is over the fact that Russian soldiers guard the border between Georgia and Turkey as well as the Georgian-Russian border and they stopped the trade flows from Turkey through Georgia and then on to Russia. Georgian officials accused Russia of treating Georgia as a Russian province. 

MID4212 lasted from November 17, 1999 to March 14, 2001. Russian helicopter gunships attacked a village in the republic of Georgia and a control post at the border with Chechenia. Three Mi-24 combat helicopters fired upon the village of Shatili about five kilometres inside Georgia, according to the commander of the Georgia border forces, General Valery Chkheidze. There were said to be "many casualties". The border between independent Georgia and the breakaway Russian republic contains the last routes not controlled by Russian forces currently fighting Islamic Chechen rebels. Georgia recently refused a request by Russia to station troops in the area to prevent movement of arms and newly recruited guerrilla fighters into the combat zone.

MID4242 was a one day incident on October 18, 2001. Georgian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Nino Sturua said that four Su-25 fighter jets had flown into Georgia territory from Russia and returned to Russia after flying over the Kodor Gorge-where fighting broke out two weeks before between Abkhazians and Georgian and Chechen guerrillas-and the Svanetia region. Five minutes after the jets left, six Su-25 jets flew the same tour and returned to Russia, she said.

Georgia declared its independence on April 9, 1991 and it was acknowledge and finalized on December 25, 1991. In 1992-4, fighting erupts in the Georgian republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where the majority populations are traditionally pro-Russian and seek to declare independence. In 1994, under a shaky ceasefire agreement, a mainly Russian force is deployed on the border between Abkhazia and Russia. Some 250,000 ethnic Georgians have fled the republic during the fighting. In 1999, Russia begins a huge new military operation in its breakaway republic of Chechnya, which borders a mountainous region of Georgia. It accuses the latter of providing refuge for Chechen rebels. Maintaining his tough tone with Moscow, Georgia's president said on November 29, 1999, that the Russian military would have to leave its weapons behind when it closes two of its four bases in Georgia. Russia promised earlier this month to close two bases it has kept in Georgia since the 1991 Soviet collapse. It was seen as a victory for Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, who has sought to distance Georgia from Russia and forge closer ties with the West. The Russian reduction was agreed upon as part of a larger treaty on European security that was signed at a summit in Istanbul, Turkey. Georgia had become increasingly impatient with the large Russian presence, and Shevardnadze has been increasingly outspoken in calling for the Russians to leave. ''As for the weapons stationed at those bases, I think they're the property of Georgia,'' Shevardnadze said in a radio interview. ''We are ready for certain compromises so relations with Russia aren't spoiled.'' Shevardnadze said additional talks on the bases, which are to be closed by July 1, 2001, must begin ''as quickly as possible.'' Russia has about 20,000 troops in Georgia, and the closure of the bases in Gudauta, in Georgia's breakaway province of Abkhazia, and Vaziani, near the Georgian capital Tbilisi, would halve that number. Russia would still have two remaining bases. Shevardnadze's comments were sure to further irritate Moscow, which has been extremely critical of Georgia, and accused it of assisting militants in breakaway Chechnya. Russian troops have been battling the militants since August in Chechnya, which shares a border with Georgia. The Russian claim that the Chechens have set up satellite communication equipment on Georgian territory, though Shevardnadze dismissed the allegations as ''silly inventions.'' Relations between Russia and Georgia have been strained since separatists in Georgia's Abkhazia province drove out government forces in a 1992-93 war. Georgia has accused Russia of siding with the separatists and failing to ensure the return of some 300,000 refugees to the province. Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in the region since 1994. In 1999, a partnership agreement between Georgia and the European Union comes into force. Starting Dec. 5, 2000, Russia begins imposing visa restrictions on Georgia. But Russia exempts residents of the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia/Tskhinvali from this regime The strained relations between Russia and Georgia have reached their climax. Russia started to impose visa restrictions on Georgian citizens on Dec. 5 and stopped supplying electricity to Georgia last week. Georgian citizens are now being required to hold a valid visa in order to travel to Russia; however, it is interesting that Russia, taking a unilateral action, exempted residents of the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia/Tskhinvali from these rules while still enforcing them against Georgia. On October 19, 2000, Russian Vice Premier Ilya Klebanov said that Russia may use its levers if Georgia insists on the dismantling of Russian military bases. "Russian-Georgian negotiations that began in Tbilisi were expected to break the deadlock in the relations between the two states. There was even talk among observers that the relations between Moscow and Tbilisi are worse than at any time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, worse even than during the Abkhazia war.

"According to the Foreign Ministry and the State Chancellery of Georgia, the talks between Russia and Georgia began with a restatement of the former positions of the two sides. Tbilisi insists that two Russian military bases, in Vaziani and Gudauta, be dismantled before July 1, 2001 and two more, in Batumi and Akhalkalaki, before the end of 2003. New unpleasant elements have crept into the Russian-Georgian disputes over the issue of bases. "In response to Georgia's request that Russian troops be withdrawn, Vice Premier Ilya Klebanov who leads the Russian delegation said that Russia has fully met its obligations to the OSCE and the European community under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and has withdrawn from Georgia its excess military hardware with the help of the Black Sea Fleet... The Vice Premier hinted that if Georgia refuses to recognize the Batumi and Akhalkalaki bases, Russia will refuse to dismantle the first two bases. So, all the four military bases will stay in Georgia. "By Wednesday evening the parties had not reached a compromise. The solution proposed by Georgia-transforming the Gudauta military base in Abkhazia into a that could be used by Russian peacekeepers-does not suit Russia. "Mr. Klebanov made it clear that if Georgia insisted on dismantling all the four bases, Russia could press into service some strong levers and demand the introduction of a visa regime and the repayment of Georgia's $180 million debt. In response Georgia raises the question of the foreign assets of the Soviet Union in which Georgia has a 6-percent share costing about 15 billion dollars. In 2001, new fighting in Abkhazia, where pro-independence forces have formed their own government. In 2002, Georgia accuses Russia of violating its sovereignty by bombing Chechen rebels on its territory. Moscow denies the charge. Angry accusations between Russia and Georgia rose in pitch on August 28, 2002, as President Vladimir Putin accused Russia's tiny neighbor of making a show instead of real efforts to combat Chechen militants Moscow says have found refuge in its Pankisi Gorge. Putin's remarks drew a quick response from Georgia, where a spokesman for President Eduard Shevardnadze accused Russia of deliberately fueling tension in order to bring the former Soviet republic back under Kremlin control. In acerbic remarks carried by Russian television networks, Putin derided Georgia for first denying the presence of any militants on its territory, then refusing to pool efforts with Russia to combat them.

"Without the active support of Russia we will keep pushing these terrorists ... back and forth" between Georgia and Chechnya, Putin said while attending military exercises in Siberia. Georgia has rejected Russia's demands to let its troops enter the Pankisi Gorge near the Chechen border and launched its own security sweep in the area on Sunday. Washington believes some militants there could be linked to al-Qaida, and it has sent U.S. military instructors to teach Georgian troops anti-terrorist skills. The Georgian operation in Pankisi has vexed Russian officials, who said Georgia should not simply be pushing militants out but arresting them and handing them over to Russia-or killing them and handing over the bodies. Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has said that the operation was preceded by his government's warning to rebels to leave Georgia in order to avoid bloodshed, and the Georgian troops have not reported finding any militants in Pankisi so far. "Let's hope that what the Georgian leadership is doing now won't be limited to an imitation of action," Putin said. "Let's hope that it has the honest intention of getting rid of the terrorists on its soil." He likened rebels allegedly holed up in Georgia to al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan, saying that their presence "inflicts real damage on Russia" as they ship weapons and mount raids into Chechnya. Shevardnadze's spokesman Kakha Imnadze accused Russia of deliberately jacking up tension in order to "invade not just Pankisi, but Tbilisi as well." Tbilisi is Georgia's capital. Georgia officially applies to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2002; the arrival in the country of 200 military instructors from the United States further angers Russia. The Caucasian republic also agrees to a US plan to build a key pipeline across its territory, carrying gas westwards from Azerbaijan without passing through Russia. In 2004, following a year of agitation sparked by student activists, a peaceful "Rose Revolution" leads to elections in Georgia which bring to power a pro-western grouping under Mikhail Saakashvili. Fighting in Adjaria, another restive region of Georgia, sparks more tension with Moscow. In 2005, US President George W. Bush visits Georgia and praises the "Rose Revolution"; Washington agrees to provide financial aid. Georgia and Russia reach agreement on the removal of remaining Russian bases from the Caucasian republic. In January 2006, Georgia shivers in midwinter cold after explosions destroy two pipelines bringing gas from Russia. In September 2006, in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, officials arrest four Russian officers accused of spying. The move sparks a major new crisis with Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry on September 22, 2006, strongly criticized NATO's decision to deepen its cooperation with Georgia, saying the move could upset fragile stability in the Caucasus and hurt Russia's interests. Mikhail Saakashvili lashed out at Russia, accusing Moscow of waging a "gangster occupation" of his nation and seeking to annex Georgia's separatist provinces.

NARRATIVE-CR:

MID3561 lasted from June 13, 1992 to October 26, 1993. This is the conflict over Abkhazia during which Russia intervened with forces to support the Russian population in the break-away republic of Abkhazia, inside Georgian territory.

MID4096 lasted from August 25, 1997 to December 23, 1997. This dispute is over the fact that Russian soldiers guard the border between Georgia and Turkey as well as the Georgian-Russian border and they stopped the trade flows from Turkey through Georgia and then on to Russia. Georgian officials accused Russia of treating Georgia as a Russian province. 

MID4212 lasted from November 17, 1999 to March 14, 2001. Russian helicopter gunships attacked a village in the republic of Georgia and a control post at the border with Chechenia. Three Mi-24 combat helicopters fired upon the village of Shatili about five kilometres inside Georgia, according to the commander of the Georgia border forces, General Valery Chkheidze. There were said to be "many casualties". The border between independent Georgia and the breakaway Russian republic contains the last routes not controlled by Russian forces currently fighting Islamic Chechen rebels. Georgia recently refused a request by Russia to station troops in the area to prevent movement of arms and newly recruited guerrilla fighters into the combat zone.

MID4242 was a one day incident on October 18, 2001. Georgian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Nino Sturua said that four Su-25 fighter jets had flown into Georgia territory from Russia and returned to Russia after flying over the Kodor Gorge-where fighting broke out two weeks before between Abkhazians and Georgian and Chechen guerrillas-and the Svanetia region. Five minutes after the jets left, six Su-25 jets flew the same tour and returned to Russia, she said.

Georgia declared its independence on April 9, 1991 and it was acknowledge and finalized on December 25, 1991. In 1992-4, fighting erupts in the Georgian republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, where the majority populations are traditionally pro-Russian and seek to declare independence. In 1994, under a shaky ceasefire agreement, a mainly Russian force is deployed on the border between Abkhazia and Russia. Some 250,000 ethnic Georgians have fled the republic during the fighting. In 1999, Russia begins a huge new military operation in its breakaway republic of Chechnya, which borders a mountainous region of Georgia. It accuses the latter of providing refuge for Chechen rebels. Maintaining his tough tone with Moscow, Georgia's president said on November 29, 1999, that the Russian military would have to leave its weapons behind when it closes two of its four bases in Georgia. Russia promised earlier this month to close two bases it has kept in Georgia since the 1991 Soviet collapse. It was seen as a victory for Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, who has sought to distance Georgia from Russia and forge closer ties with the West. The Russian reduction was agreed upon as part of a larger treaty on European security that was signed at a summit in Istanbul, Turkey. Georgia had become increasingly impatient with the large Russian presence, and Shevardnadze has been increasingly outspoken in calling for the Russians to leave. ''As for the weapons stationed at those bases, I think they're the property of Georgia,'' Shevardnadze said in a radio interview. ''We are ready for certain compromises so relations with Russia aren't spoiled.'' Shevardnadze said additional talks on the bases, which are to be closed by July 1, 2001, must begin ''as quickly as possible.''
