NARRATIVE-CM:
Greeks troops launched a military offensive against Albania on February 3, 1913, and Greeks troops occupied Gjirokaster and Tepelene in southern Albania (Northern Epirus). Albania gained Northern Epirus as a result of the *Treaty of Bucharest*, which was signed on August 10, 1913. The *Concert of Europe's *conference of ambassadors in London established a demarcation commission, which marked the border between Albania and Greece from September 1 to November 30, 1913. The Greek troops completed their withdrawal from Northern Epirus on March 31, 1914. On October 31, 1914, Greek troops occupied Northern Epirus in support of an ethnic Greek government in southern Albania. King Constantine of Greece signed a royal decree uniting Northern Epirus with Greece in March 1916. Greece demanded Northern Epirus at the Paris Peace Conference on January 18, 1919. Italy agreed to support Greece's claim to Northern Epirus on July 20, 1919. The *Allied Conference of Ambassaors *(ACA), which consisted of representatives from Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, reconfirmed Albania's sovereignty over Northern Epirus on November 9, 1921. Albania's borders, including Northern Epirus, were confirmed as a result of a demarcation agreement signed by representatives of Britain, France, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia in Paris on July 30, 1926. Italian troops and Albanian troops invaded Greece from Albanian territory on October 28, 1940, but Greek troops launched a counter-offensive on November 14, 1940. Greek troops captured Korce on November 22, 1940. German troops intervened in support of the Italians on April 6, 1941, and German troops occupied Greece on April 27, 1941. Greece claimed Northern Epirus in southern Albania on November 10, 1945. Communist rebels led by General Markos Vaphiades began a rebellion against the Greek government on February 12, 1946, and Albania provided military assistance to the communist rebels. Albania accused Greece of military incursions in southern Albania, and referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) General Assembly on October 30, 1946. On December 4, 1946, Greece requested that the UN Security Council investigate allegations that Albania and other countries were providing military assistance to Greek communist rebels. The UN Security Council discussed the allegations on December 10-18, 1946, and established an eleven-member commission of inquiry (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Republic of China, Columbia, France, Poland, Soviet Union, Syria, United Kingdom, and the US) on December 19, 1946. The UN commission of inquiry, which was assisted by a staff of twenty-seven personnel, issued a report on May 27, 1947 that substantiated Greece's accusations against its neighbors. UN Security Council resolutions pertaining to the commission's report were vetoed by the Soviet Union, and the dispute was referred to the UN General Assembly. The UN General Assembly established the *United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans* (UNSCOB) on October 21, 1947. UNSCOB consisted of eleven representatives and 23 staff personnel from Australia, Brazil, Republic of China, France, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and the United States. UNSCOB deployed some 35 military observers from Brazil, Republic of China, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, UK, and the US to monitor the border region. The Greek communist government of General Markos Vaphiades fled into Albania on August 6, 1948 after a military offensive by Greek government troops in the Grammos mountains beginning on June 19, 1948. Two UNSCOB military observers were killed in a plane crash on February 17, 1949. The Albanian government accused Greece of military incursions into Albanian territory from August 2-9, 1949, resulting in the deaths of several hundred Greek soldiers and Albanians. Albania referred the Greek incursions to UNSCOB on August 10, 1949, and protested the incursions to the UN secretary-general on August 15, 1949. Albania announced on August 26, 1949 that it would close its border and end its assistance to Greek communist rebels. Some 8,000 communist rebels fled into Albania on August 30, 1949 after a military offensive by Greek government troops in the Grammos mountains beginning on August 10, 1949. 

On August 10, 1949, Albania accused Greece of invading its territory. Albania charged that Greek Army planes and artillery had bombed, shelled and strafed hundreds of Albanians in the border zone between Leskovik and Bozhigrad. Albania charged that Greece entered its territory in the border area between Leskovik and Bozhigrad. Greece denies such allegations and stated that Greece is conducting an offensive against Communist rebels in the border area of the Grammos mountains. The bodies of 20 Albanian Army regular soldiers were found in the vicinity of Kroustalopiyi a few miles within Greek territory and seven Albanian Army regulars were captured along with files pertaining to one Albanian Army Company, was reported by the Greek General Staff on August 15, 1949. On August 17, 1949, the Greek Army effectively sealed off the border with Albania from the Slimnitsa Gap northward to the Yugoslav border. On August 30, 1949, all the routes to Albania were sealed off and Greek rebels who were receiving support from Albania were trapped inside Greece. 

On September 10, 1949, Greek Premier Alexander Diomides told the press that the members of the Greek Government's Coordinating Council agreed to seek a line of moderation in the relationship with Albania. He said that the great powers (UK and US) should take the lead in telling Albania to cut support for the Greek rebel groups still active on its territory. The Greek plan for dealing with this issue is to suggest an international armed force to patrol the border between Greece and Albania and a U.N. presence in Albania to assist with the disarmament and demobilization of the Greek rebels. On September 14, 1949 the British Government cautioned Greece against invading Albania to wipe out the Greek rebels' bases. On September 6, 1950 Greece denied in a report sent to the U.N. that it violated Albania's territory and airspace as Albania accused it to in June 1950. On October 19, 1950, Albania accused Greece of another six border violations out of which one was of the airspace. In November and December 1950, Albania accused Greece again of several border violations. In one instance in November 1950 Albania said that Greek soldiers withdrew from Albania when fired on by Albanian border guards. On August 9, 1951 Albania accused that Greece killed an Albanian soldier and wounded five on an Albanian frontier post. Greece declared unfounded 18 border violations accusations from Albania in March 1951. An Albanian charge that Greece has intensified violations of its border was made public in October 1951. On December 3, 1951 Albania indicted Greece to the U.N. for 18 border violations including two in which it accused Greek border guards of starting the incidents. These accusations continued through 1952 and 1953. Albanians and Greeks clashed near the border on July 16, 1952, resulting in the death of one Greek citizen. On June 27, 1953, The Greek Foreign Minister said that Greece maintains the claims it has on the Northern Epirus region of Southern Albania. On August 3, 1955 Greece announced the UN Secretariat that it is willing to resume diplomatic relations with Albania under certain conditions. Greece and Albania have been in a state of war since 1940. After the negotiation to end the war, Greece would require Albania to take steps to end border violations. Greece also demands the return of all hostages removed during the Communist-inspired guerilla war. Greece's longstanding claims on Northern Epirus, or southern Albania still hold, but Greece would agree to settle them by peaceful means. On August 14, 1955, Albania rejected Greece's offer to resume diplomatic relations and said that the conditions were unacceptable. Albania refused the charge that the two countries were still in a state of war. Albania and Greece signed an agreement on February 8, 1958, providing for the joint removal of mines from the Corfu Channel. 

On December 23, 1961, a request from the Central Committee of the North Epirean Struggle, a body of Greek refugees from South Albania, was given to the Greek Government to continue the fight to get back South Albania/North Epir to Greece. The dispute was not solved since WWII. On January 21, 1962, the major obstacle in restoring Greek-Albanian relations was the 2,000 square miles of disputed territory in South Albania which the Greeks call North Epirus. On August 10, 1964, Albania returned to Greece 72 refugees taken hostage during the 1949 retreat of the Greek Communist guerillas. On March 24, 1966, Greece and Albania agreed to resume trading for the first time since 1940 when they broke off relations. These were the most serious relations started since 1940 between the two countries. On June 2, 1970, a four-member trade mission from Albania visited neighboring Greece for the first time in 30 years. This visit followed the signing in January 1970 of a trade agreement at a non-governmental level between Greek and Albanian Chambers of Commerce. The agreement allows for Greek exports to Albania worth 800 million USD and imports from Albania of 700 million USD. The governmental relations are still sore as the two countries have never signed a peace treaty following the declaration of war from the Albanian puppet regime in 1940. On August 23, 1970 there were Albanian diplomatic efforts aimed at thawing relations on a wide variety of issues. Albanian-Greek trade pact was seen as landmark in what appears to be Albania's path to new concept of her role in international affairs. On November 8, 1970, Greece and Albania opened direct telegraphic links for the first time since the 1940s.

Albania and Greece resumed diplomatic relations on May 6, 1971. Greece formally ended the state-of-war with Albania, and relinquished its claim to the Northern Epirus region on August 28, 1987. The Greek government expelled 200,000 illegal Albanian immigrants from Greece after Albania expelled a Greek Orthodox cleric from southern Albania on June 25, 1993. Greece announced six conditions for improving relations with Albania on July 14, 1993, but Albania rejected the conditions on July 17, 1993. Albanians troops clashed with ethnic Greeks in southern Albania in August 1993, and the Greek government formally protested the violence. The Greek government formally protested to the Albanian government on October 26, 1993 following the beating death of an ethnic Greek in southern Albania.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Italian troops and Albanian troops invaded Greece from Albanian territory on October 28, 1940, but Greek troops launched a counter-offensive on November 14, 1940. This incident is not a MID between Albania and Greece because Albania is not considered part of the system of states from April 9, 1939 to November 17, 1944 as it was under Italian occupation. On April 12, 1939 Italy accomplished the occupation of Albania. On June 3, 1939, the Albanian foreign ministry was merged into the Italian foreign ministry, and the Albanian Foreign Minister, Xhemil Bej Dino, was given the rank of an Italian ambassador. Upon the capture of Albania, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini declared the official creation of the Italian Empire in which the figurehead King Victor Emmanuel III was crowned King of Albania which added to his other title as Emperor of Ethiopia (Ethiopia being occupied three years prior). The Albanian military was placed under Italian command and formally merged into the Italian Army in 1940. Additionally, the Italian Blackshirts formed four legions of Albanian Militia, initially recruited from Italian colonists living in Albania, but later from ethnic Albanians.

Albania followed Italy into war with Britain and France on June 10, 1940. Albania served as the base for the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940, and Albanian troops participated in the Greek campaign, but they massively deserted the frontline. The country's southern areas (including the cities of Gjirokastër and Korçë) were temporarily occupied by the Greek army during that campaign, but Italy emerged victorious after Greece capitulated to the Germans in April 1941. Greek troops captured Korce on November 22, 1940. German troops intervened in support of the Italians on April 6, 1941, and German troops occupied Greece on April 27, 1941. Albania became a member of the international system again on November 17, 1944. Greece claimed Northern Epirus in southern Albania on November 10, 1945. The first dispute (MID2371) was a border dispute between Greece and the People's Republic of Albania. The newly elected Greek cabinet made it clear in spring 1946 that it wants to redraw the map with Albania to get back the lost territories. 

Communist rebels led by General Markos Vaphiades began a rebellion against the Greek government on February 12, 1946, and Albania provided military assistance to the communist rebels.

These were the most serious relations started since 1940 between the two countries. On June 2, 1970, a four-member trade mission from Albania visited neighboring Greece for the first time in 30 years. This visit followed the signing in January 1970 of a trade agreement at a non-governmental level between Greek and Albanian Chambers of Commerce. The agreement allows for Greek exports to Albania worth 800 million USD and imports from Albania of 700 million USD. The governmental relations are still sore as the two countries have never signed a peace treaty following the declaration of war from the Albanian puppet regime in 1940. On August 23, 1970 there were Albanian diplomatic efforts aimed at thawing relations on a wide variety of issues. Albanian-Greek trade pact was seen as landmark in what appears to be Albania's path to new concept of her role in international affairs. On November 8, 1970, Greece and Albania opened direct telegraphic links for the first time since the 1940s. Albania and Greece resumed diplomatic relations on May 6, 1971. 

The first three disputes between Albania and Greece come about in part as the result of the tension between the USSR and Western Powers and because of an unstable political climate in Greece. The first dispute (MID2371) was a border dispute between Greece and the People's Republic of Albania. The second and third disputes (MID1284 and MID1285) were related to the involvement of Communist rebels in Greece and their eventual flight into Albania. Albania sheltered the rebels who were responsible for more than 50,000 deaths during the attempted rebellion in Greece (www.onwar.com 2003). Communist rebels were entering into Greece from Albania and Yugoslavia. Albania gave aid to the rebels in the Grammos mountains and supplied resources and training to their soldiers throughout 1948 and 1949. Greece ousted the last remnants of the rebel forces from the northern mountains by the end of 1949 and became a member of NATO shortly after (www.onwar.com 2003).

The second rivalry between Albania and Greece comes about after the fall of the communist regime in 1991. MID4041 is over the Albanian government's treatment of ethnic Greeks. Greek nationalists attacked an area of Albania that they claim is populated by ethnic Greeks who are mistreated by the Albanian government. Albania accused the Greek government of supporting these terrorists, but the Greek government maintained its innocence. The incident lasted from April to September 1994. In early 1994 an Albanian court sentenced five members of a Greek organization to prison on charges of undermining the Albanian state. Greece responded by freezing all EU aid to Albania. However, with the reduction of sentences and the release of two individuals, aid was restored by December of that year (New York Times 1994). The second dispute (MID4090) is a single day event which was not too damaging as Albania and Greece signed a defense pact on September 26th, 1997 (only 9 days later). Four Greek soldiers trespassed the Albanian border beating and firing at Albanian villagers in Albanian territory. Albania protested. To this day there is still tension between the two states over treatment of ethnic Albanians in Greece and Greeks in Albania therefore it is difficult to choose a date of resolution for the rivalry.

Albania's borders, including Northern Epirus, were confirmed as a result of a demarcation agreement signed by representatives of Britain, France, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia in Paris on July 30, 1926. On April 12, 1939 Italy accomplished the occupation of Albania. On June 3, 1939, the Albanian foreign ministry was merged into the Italian foreign ministry, and the Albanian Foreign Minister, Xhemil Bej Dino, was given the rank of an Italian ambassador. Upon the capture of Albania, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini declared the official creation of the Italian Empire in which the figurehead King Victor Emmanuel III was crowned King of Albania which added to his other title as Emperor of Ethiopia (Ethiopia being occupied three years prior). The Albanian military was placed under Italian command and formally merged into the Italian Army in 1940. Additionally, the Italian Blackshirts formed four legions of Albanian Militia, initially recruited from Italian colonists living in Albania, but later from ethnic Albanians. Italian troops and Albanian troops invaded Greece from Albanian territory on October 28, 1940, but Greek troops launched a counter-offensive on November 14, 1940. Greek troops captured Korce on November 22, 1940. These incidents are not MIDs between Albania and Greece because Albania is not considered part of the system of COW states from April 9, 1939 to November 17, 1944 as it was under Italian occupation. 

Albania followed Italy into war with Britain and France on June 10, 1940. Albania served as the base for the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940, and Albanian troops participated in the Greek campaign, but they massively deserted the frontline. The country's southern areas (including the cities of Gjirokastër and Korçë) were temporarily occupied by the Greek army during that campaign, but Italy emerged victorious after Greece capitulated to the Germans in April 1941. Albania is not considered part of the system of states from April 9, 1939 to November 17, 1944 as it was under Italian occupation.

Albania and Greece resumed diplomatic relations on May 6, 1971. The Greek Foreign Ministry said that the two countries will resume relations at ambassadorial level. On April 1, 1977, Nedin Hoxha, Albania's trade minister concluded a visit to Greece. During his visit, he held talks with Ioannis Varvitsiotis, Greek Commerce Minister, on developing trade relations between the two countries. The two ministers signed an agreement for exchange of goods between Albania and Greece for the current year and other two agreements.

A Greek government trade delegation, led by the Minister of Trade, Yeoryios Panayrotopoulos arrived in Albania on 6th November, 1979. Its members were later received by the Albanian Minister of Trade, Nedin Hoxha, with whom they have talks on the further development of trade between the two countries. Hoxha and Panayiotopolous signed a protocol on goods exchange for 1980. The signing ceremony was also attended by Reiz Malile, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Myrteza Sinoimeri, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, and members of both delegations. A luncheon was given by the Greek Ambassador to Albania, Konstandinos Politis, and was attended by Nedin Hoxha, Myrteza Sinoimeri, Rahman Hanku, the Minister of Construction; and Justin Papajorgi, Director of the Fourth Directorate of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. A dinner in honour of the delegation was hosted by Nedin Hoxha. Rahman Hanku, Myrteza Sinoimeri, Reiz Malile, and members of both delegations were present. Panayiotopoulos was received by Deputy Premier Adil Carcani on the following day. Nedin Hoxha, Reiz Malile and Ambassador Politis were present. The Greek visitors left Albania on 8th November. Before their departure, they toured Sarande and Vlore Districts in the company of Nedin Hoxha and the Greek Ambassador. 

On October 14, 1980, further talks on improvement of relations on the economic, commercial and cultural fields were envisioned by Greece and Albania.The cautious warming of the Greek-Albanian relationship in October 1984, led last spring to a visit to Athens by an Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister, Muhamet Kapllani. A Greek Deputy Foreign Minister, Karolos Papoulias, is scheduled to return the visit next month. The Greek Government is reported to be pleased enough with the trend that it may be prepared to shelve an issue that has bedeviled relations since the end of World War II. The issue is a Greek contention that Greece and Albania remain formally in a state of war, which began when Italian-occupied Albania took part in the Axis invasion of Greece, and that a formal Albanian act is required to end it. The Albanian view is that it was Italy that made war, that the signatures of both Albania and Greece to the Paris document that ended the war in Europe in effect restored peace and that the opening of diplomatic relations in 1971 meant they had made peace. Past Greek Governments avoided burying the matter because of reported pressure from ethnic Greeks in southern Albania. Some of them are said to consider their area part of the Greek historical region of Epirus. The present Greek Socialist Government is reported to believe that it can do more for the ethnic Greek minority by improving relations with Albania than by pushing territorial claims. Greece has also opened on a daily basis one of the two border-crossing points, previously passable only two days a week. Albania is expected to make a similar move in another area. Moreover, there are indications Albania may soon make a gesture by beginning to train Greek-language teachers for the Greek minority. Albania, believed to have felt increasingly isolated since a break with China in the late 1970's, first sought unsuccessfully to mend relations with Yugoslavia, and has now apparently decided to make the approaches to Greece and Italy. 

In May 1986, Greece was preparing to put a formal end to a legal vestige of World War II by proclaiming that it no longer considers itself at war with Albania. The proposed action, which, according to Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, may come this month, is strongly opposed by organizations in Athens and abroad that say that much of southern Albania is Greek territory. The largest such group is in the United States, which became a refuge for most of the Greeks who fled when the region of Epirus was divided between Greece and Albania after World War I. Mr. Papoulias's informal announcement of the pending action last month was also condemned by the major opposition party, New Democracy. The conservatives accused the Socialist Government of failing to assure the rights of Albania's Greek minority in return for ending the state of war. Albania, an Italian puppet nation after the invasion in 1939, joined Italy in declaring war in 1940. Greece responded with a decree of a state of belligerency, under which Athens took into custody as enemy property extensive real-estate holdings of ethnic Greeks living across the border. The decree remains valid, and relatives in Greece enjoy the use of the properties-mainly in the Athens and Salonika areas-whose owners or heirs remain north of the border. Albania says that it is not responsible for what was done in its name by Italy and that Athens implicitly ended the state of war by signing postwar agreements restoring peace in Europe and opening diplomatic relations with Albania in 1971. To prevent militantly Communist Albania, which has nationalized all private property, from claiming the ''enemy'' holdings, Greece is expected to include in its measure scrapping of the state of war a declaration that it will not surrender the properties of ethnic Greeks. Those opposed to the action are urging the Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to extract from Albania, the Government of which is considered the most restrictive in Europe, improvements in human rights for the Greek minority in return for declaring peace. They are no longer pursuing earlier efforts for the recovery of northern Epirus by Greece. Albania publishes no ethnic statistics, but some in Greece estimate that there are as many as 400,000 ethnic Greeks in a population of 2.7 million in 1981. Albanian authorities have told Greek officials that the number is 50,000 to 60,000. The Papandreou Government, according to a Foreign Ministry official, believes that rather than exacting a quid pro quo, Greece should take advantage of Albania's tentative efforts to improve ties with some Western nations by the encouragement that an end of the state of belligerency might provide. An official said progress had been made and could be measured by realities rather than formal agreements. In 1984, he said, a Greek rural guard strayed across the border while hunting and was shot dead. Recently a farmer made the same mistake while drunk and was sent home. The official said cross-border family visits had increased, but Vlassis Socratides, general secretary of the association of northern Epirus groups in Greece, said that the visits remained limited to pro-Communists from both sides and that those coming from Albania have had to leave close family members behind as hostages for their return. The total number of such visitors, which has not been made public, is estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 a year from both sides. The official said two Greeks had lectured last year at an Albanian college in Gjirokaster on teaching Greek. Curbs on manifestations of national culture, including the language, are among the principal accusations that Albania is suppressing the minority. The ethnic Greeks, like all other Albanians-who were about 70 percent Moslem before World War II-are affected by Albania's proclamation in 1967 that it had become the world's first atheist nation. All religious institutions, including Orthodox churches, a contributor to a sense of Greek ethnicity, were closed, and religious literature and teaching outlawed. Pope John Paul II recently issued an appeal for religious freedom. ''In Albania, the church has disappeared on the surface, but we know well that the church cannot disappear from people's hearts,'' the Pope said to a group of Albanian refugees in a parish church in Rome.

On August 28, 1987 Greece announced it had officially ended the state of war with neighboring Albania and any territorial claims on Albanian territory that had lingered as a legal leftover from World War II. "The government declares that its characterization of Albania as an enemy state has ceased to exist," said government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos. His announcement came one week before Albanian Deputy Foreign Minister Sokrat Plaka is due in Athens for a five-day official visit. Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government, which came to power in 1981, has sought to improve relations with communist Albania and last year declared its intention of lifting the state of war. But problems over real-estate holdings of ethnic Greeks living in southern Albania, confiscated by the Greek government when war was declared in 1940, had delayed the decree, according to Foreign Ministry officials. Kostopoulos said lifting the state of war would improve the status of the ethnic Greek minority in Albania, thought to number around 300,000 and form almost 10 percent of the country's population. He did not say if the property issues had been settled. The government's decision was denounced as "criminal" by Bishop Sebastian of Konitsa. He heads a campaign for freedom of worship and preservation of the Greek language in Albania. "We strongly condemn the government's one-sided decision to raise the state of war without first securing the human rights of the North Epirots," said the Greek Orthodox bishop. His diocese nominally includes North Epirus, the Greek name for southern Albania where most ethnic Greeks live. Churches were closed when Albania outlawed religion in 1967 and declared the country officially atheist. Greece declared war against Albania in 1940 when Italian troops invaded Greece through North Epirus. For Albania, lifting the state of war was a symbolic gesture, since Albanian officials have said the conflict ended when Greek-Albanian diplomatic relations were re-established in 1971. Albania closed its border with Greece in 1946 and ordinary Albanians are constitutionally barred from traveling abroad. But since 1984, several hundred ethnic Greeks in Albania have been allowed to stay for up to three months with relatives in Greece. Thousands of Greeks now take advantage of regular tours organized by Albturist, the Albanian state tourist authority, to visit their relatives in Albania.

On January 17, 1990 it was announced that a senior Albanian official is to visit Greece shortly to try to reduce tension between the two countries after allegations of human rights abuses in Albania. Antonis Samaras, the Greek Foreign Minister, said yesterday that Sokrat Plaka, Albania's foreign under-secretary, would visit Greece at Albania's request on 26 January, 1990. The announcement follows reports in Greece that four ethnic Greeks were murdered by Albanian police after they attempted to slip across the border into Greece. Albania denied the charges. The incident has prompted a row within Greece's all-party government over the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, estimated to number some 300,000. Antonis Samaras, the conservative Foreign Minister, yesterday accused Karolos Papoulias, the Socialist deputy Defence Minister and a former foreign minister, of 'suffering from confusion' when equating the government's concern for human rights with interference in Albania's internal affairs. Mr Samaras was responding to a suggestion by Mr Papoulias that he might consider resigning because of his 'personal statements' on the matter. Tension between Athens and Tirana over reports that a young Greek-Albanian was tortured to death after trying to cross the border into Greece increased when Mr Samaras expressed the hope that 'the Greek Christian minority in Albania will soon be able to celebrate Christmas freely, as the Romanians are doing today'. Mr Papoulias pursued a policy of rapprochement with Albania, hoping that this would lead to improved rights for the Greek minority. In 1987 a 47-year technical state of war between the two countries was lifted, and since then there has been a marked increase in cross-border business and family contacts, albeit carefully vetted by Tirana. But lobbyists for 'Northern Epirus' (south Albania) here claim that conditions for the minority have deteriorated. Mr Papoulias fears that public demands for improvements are counter-productive. Tens of thousands of Albanians, many of them Greek, are believed to be held in labour camps.

In July 1993, Greece has stepped up the pressure on Albania, its northern neighbor, by demanding that it take measures to improve the condition of its ethnic Greek minority. Albania has denounced the demands as an attempt to sow discord as ethnic and political tensions rise in the lower Balkans. Conflict between the two countries has been mounting since late June, when Albania expelled a Greek Orthodox clergyman from the southern town of Gjirokaster and accused him of inciting local Greeks to campaign for unification with Greece. Athens responded by deporting tens of thousands of Albanians who had entered Greece illegally in search of work. The dispute has intensified suspicion and hostility in the Balkans and added to fears that the conflicts in former Yugoslavia may spread south.

The Greek Prime Minister, Constantine Mitsotakis, said Albania was guilty of double standards by demanding fair treatment for ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, while discriminating against its own ethnic Greeks. He urged Albania to adopt the following six measures:
-Allow the Orthodox clergyman, Chrysostomos Maidonis, to return to his parish, and let people use Greek in church services.
-Improve Greek-language education.
-Allow Greek political and cultural associations, and return Greek properties confiscated by Albania's former Communist rulers.
-Stop sacking and discriminating against ethnic Greeks in the public sector.
-Permit ethnic Greeks who left Albania after 1944 to return and reclaim their properties.
-Allow Albanian citizens to choose their national identity.
Mr Mitsotakis stressed that Greece had no territorial claims on southern Albania, what Greeks call Northern Epirus. He added: ''We believe the best thing that Albania could do to promote the case of Albanian minorities in other countries is to end the oppression of the Greek minority's rights inside Albania immediately.''Albania and Greece disagree over how many Greeks live in Albania. Albania says there are only 60,000 Greeks, but Greece says there are at least 250,000. Mr Mitsotakis's demands drew a stern riposte from Albania's Foreign Minister, Alfred Serreqi: ''It is unacceptable to use the minority in Albania to sow the seeds of discord at a time when the Greek side does not even condescend to discuss the long existence of Albanian minorities in Greece.'' Albania's Prime Minister, Aleksander Meksi, went further and raised the question of Greece's treatment of ethnic Albanians who, before the Second World War, lived in the northern Greek region of Cameria. At the end of the war, Greece evicted Albanian Muslims, but not Albanian Christians, from Cameria to Albania. Mr Meksi suggested that Greece owed these people compensation.

Albania said on August 24, 1994, that it had withdrawn its ambassador from Greece, a sign that tensions between the two countries are entering a new stage of confrontation. President Sali Berisha recalled his ambassador to Athens for ''consultations'' after a Greek plane flew into Albania's airspace and dropped leaflets calling for the removal of the Albanian government. The Greek authorities denied the plane had flown its mission with official approval. They said the pilot had stolen an aircraft from the island of Corfu, just off Albania's Adriatic coast, and had later been suspended pending an official investigation. The incident could scarcely have occurred at a more sensitive time. Five political activists from Albania's ethnic Greek minority are on trial in Tirana on charges of military espionage, and Greece last week began a wave of deportations of illegal Albanian immigrants. Mr Berisha said that the plane's flight was ''a grave provocation, a shameful, premeditated and organised act, and an adoption of Cold War tactics''. The Albanian Foreign Ministry said the leaflets dropped had borne the imprint of the Greek flag and had called for the overthrow of Albania's constitutional order. Greece dismissed Tirana's complaints and tried to focus attention on the alleged discrimination suffered by Albania's ethnic Greeks. ''Albania is acting thoughtlessly and it will not be long before it regrets this,'' said President Constantine Karamanlis. The socialist Prime Minister, Andreas Papandreou, echoed the president's remarks. ''Every step against the Greek minority in Albania will be answered,'' he told reporters. Relations between Greece and Albania have rarely been free of suspicion and hostility since the Second World War. Greece recalls that Italian forces used Albania as a base for invading Greek territory in 1940, while Albania recalls that soon afterwards Greece occupied a Greek-inhabited area of southern Albania, now northern Epirus. Albania suspects Greece of covertly promoting secessionist ambitions among its Greek minority, estimated at 60,000 by Albania but put at 300,000 or more by Greece.

Albanian President Sali Berisha asked world leaders on September 2, 1994, to intervene with Greece to stop the expulsion of Albanian immigrants and help improve relations between the reluctant neighbors. Traditionally tense relations between Albania and Greece have deteriorated alarmingly since five members of Albania's ethnic Greek minority went on trial on charges of espionage last month. Greece has sharply protested the trial and demanded the charges by dropped. And in apparent retaliation, Greece stepped up expulsions of illegal Albanian immigrants who have been repatriated by the thousands. In a letter addressed to the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the European Union and other government leaders, Berisha urged them to ''intervene with the Greek government in order to stop this inhuman and mass expulsion of Albanians and to start a dialogue.'' Berisha claimed six people have been killed during the expulsions. Following reports that some Albanians were mistreated, Greek authorities issued orders to police not to allow beatings. Berisha reiterated Albania's readiness for talks. Greece has refused negotiations with Albania. The trial is expected to end in the next few days. The prosecutor has asked prison terms ranging from seven to nine years. Berisha also invited foreign monitors to Albania to review the situation of the Greek minority which Athens maintains is not guaranteed human rights. Berisha reiterated Albania's claim that Greece is using the issue as a means of ''disquising the unacceptable standard of the situation of the Albanian, Slav and Turkish minorities in Greece.'' If monitors visit Albania, ''these delegations should also visit Greece on account of the same issues,'' he said. Berisha accused Greece of working together with Serbia to destabilize the Balkans. ''The policy Greece is pursuing against Albania draws its main source from the coordinated ambitions of Serbian and Greek nationalism to raise tension and bring instability to the south of the Balkans at a very delicate juncture for our peninsula,'' Berisha wrote. Because of the volatile history of the Balkans and simmering disputes among the region's neighbors, there are fears in the international community that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina could spread. 

On September 2, 1994, Greece blocked European Union economic aid to Albania, saying this was in retaliation for the trial in Tirana of five ethnic Greeks accused of espionage. In July, the EU agreed to let Albania have 15 million ECU (dollars 18.6 million) in aid. It stipulated that another 20 million ECU (dollars 25 million) would be provided after the EU approved of a report on human rights in Albania that would be drawn up by the European Commission. ''Meanwhile, we saw the start of the trial, which set relations between Greece and Albania on a new footing,'' foreign affairs undersecretary Yannos Kranidiotis, who handles European issues, told reporters.

Albania and Greece agreed to improve their strained relations at a meeting on March 13, 1995, between Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and his visiting Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias. They described their meeting as "open and friendly" and spoke of "a new stage in the Albanian-Greek relationship". "We are determined to move towards new, better relations with Albania," Papoulias told reporters. The Albanian foreign minister said the meeting had shown the good will on both sides for overcoming existing problems. Papoulias arrived in Tirana on an official two-day visit. Greece and Albania have been at odds for more than a year over the rights of ethnic Greeks in southern Albania and the presence of more than 250,000 mostly illegal Albanian emigrants in Greece. The Albanian foreign minister also called on Greece to recognize the property rights of the small ethnic Albanian minority, the so-called Tchames, in northern Greece. Both sides agreed to set up a joint committee for the delineation of the border between the two countries. An Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the two ministers had also agreed on expanded economic cooperation, including the creation of an Albanian-Greek bank in Tirana and the abolition of double taxation in mutual trade. They had also agreed on the opening of new checkpoints at the Albanian-Greek borders. Papoulias will have talks with Albanian President Sali Berisha and Prime Minister Alexander Meksi. 

Greek Prime Minister Kostas Simitis, on a one-day visit to Albania, met Albania's President Rexhep Meidani on October 15, 1997, to discuss bilateral cooperation and the situation in the Balkans. Simitis was accompanied in the talks by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangallos. Meidani said cooperation between Albania and Greece could become "a model and symbol of bilateral cooperation" for the whole Balkan region. He praised "the important role of Greece in the creation of a positive climate in the Balkans". For his part, Simitis pledged that Greece would continue its efforts to expand "the traditional friendship and cooperation with Albania". Albanian and Greek officials were expected to sign agreements on Greek economic support and on the opening of new border crossings between the two countries. Simitis is the most senior Western official to visit Albania since its new Socialist-led coalition government took office in early July. Greece is Albania's third-largest economic partner after Italy. 

On 25 November, 2002, Greece confirmed all-round support for Albania's membership with NATO. The confirmation was made at a meeting in Athens between Defence Ministers of Greece and Albania, Yiannos Papandoniou and Pandeli Majko, who also signed two agreements on military cooperation. After the meeting, Papandoniou declared that Greece supports Albania's membership with NATO through all means at its disposal and will help Albania adapt the command and structure of the armed forces to NATO standards. Papandoniou, who said that today's meeting was continuation of conversation the two ministers had made a few days ago in Prague at the NATO summit, made public the reactivation of the Greek-Turkish initiative to take Albania and Macedonia under their wing, as in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, two countries that became NATO members only a few days ago. Papandoniou said that he would have the approval of the Albanian and Macedonian counterparts on this thing, while he had not yet talked to the new Turkish defense minister, adding that he also expected to have a positive answer from the latter as, he said, Greece and Turkey want to cooperate in the Balkans, especially in the framework of expanding NATO with Balkan countries. The two ministers signed two cooperation agreements. The first has to do with the military base of Durres and the second with the military hospital of Gjirokaster, works financed by Greece. Majko declared that with the agreements signed today and those to be signed in the future, the military relations between Albania and Greece result to be the best in the entire history of bilateral relations. This cooperation will mean more confidence. "We cannot be integrated into the European Union and NATO unless we are first integrated into one another," said Majko.

Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis on September 16, 2004, stressed that mutual respect for minorities was a vital factor in further promoting relations of friendship and cooperation with neighboring Albania, which has a sizeable ethnic Greek minority living within its borders, and for reinforcing Albania's European prospects. Speaking after a meeting in Athens with his Albanian counterpart Kastriot Islami, Molyviatis also underlined that the hundreds of thousands of Albanian immigrants living and working in Greece contributed both to Albania's economic development but also to economic life in Greece. `It is our unwavering decision not to allow some isolated fanatical or extremist behaviors both in Albania and in Greece to affect the positive course of the many-tiered relations of neighborliness and friendliness between the two countries," he said. He described Greek-Albanian relations as having "strategic importance and a steady basis". Islami said the Greek minority in Albania and the Albanian minority in Greece were a bridge of cooperation between the two countries and thanked the Greek minister for Greece's official policy toward Albanian citizens. He assured Molyviatis that Albania will adopt all European standards for rights and also stressed that "isolated, sporadic phenomena" will not be allowed to strain relations between Greece and Albania. The two ministers said they had reached full agreement during their talks, during which they had reviewed developments in the area and Albania's European and Euro-Atlantic prospects, as well as the full range of issues in bilateral relations. The meeting comes shortly after incidents with racist overtones, some of them violent that took place in Athens and Tirana earlier this month in the wake of the Greek national team's defeat by Albania in a soccer match for the world cup tournament. 

Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos promoted a message of conciliation on October 19, 2004, as he called on Albanians and Greeks to stop bickering and instead work together to bring the tiny Balkan country closer to the European Union. Stephanopoulos, however, faced questions about the treatment of Albanian immigrants in Greece and reparations for tens of thousands of Albanians, known as Cams, who were forced out of northern Greece in 1944. "I truly want to improve relations between Greece and Albania," Stephanopoulos told Tirana Mayor Edi Rama. "The intention of Greece is to help Albania and the rest of the Balkans to join the European Union." Prime Minister Fatos Nano and opposition leader Sali Berisha reassured Stephanopoulos that they also wanted better ties with Greece, which is Albania's second-largest trading partner and among its largest foreign investors. "We talked about our priority sectors and the strategic partnership that exists between Greece and Albania as a vital element for our country's European integration," Nano said after the meeting, on the second day of Stephanopoulos' three-day visit. Stephanopoulos' position is largely ceremonial and he cannot speak for Greece's government. But his efforts to improve relations between the two neighbors were lauded by Albanian political leaders. "Albanians, in Albania but also the hundreds of thousands in Greece, have a true friend in President Stephanopoulos," Berisha said. During all his meetings Stephanopoulos said a small Greek minority in southern Albania, which has in the past complained of discrimination, and the large community of Albanian immigrant workers in Greece, should serve to bridge differences between the two countries. "We have by conservative accounts more than 600,000 Albanians working in Greece who have helped with our economic development," he said after meeting Rama. Immigrants sent home [euro]700 million (US$875 million) in remittances last year. "The issue of the Greek minority is improving. All that is left for us is to broaden our economic cooperation so we can eventually help lead Albania into the European Union," Stephanopoulos said. He also sought to deflect Albanian criticism over the Cam reparation issue, insisting that it had closed 60 years ago. Albanians have for years demanded that Greece pay compensation for property they lost. Albanians, he said, should put the issue behind them as Greeks had done with demands for reparations caused by Nazi atrocities during World War II. Relations between the two neighbors often become tense because of perceptions of racism and xenophobia against Albanians living in Greece. They worsened after Greek soccer fans and Albanian immigrants clashed following a Sept. 4 World Cup qualifying match, in which Albania beat Greece 2-1. An Albanian fan was killed and more than a dozen people were injured in the clashes. Relations have also been strained in recent years over the refusal of some Greek high schools to allow Albanian students to carry the Greek flag during an Oct. 28 parade marking a national holiday. By law, the top student carries the flag. In recent days, students at a high school in southern Greece have staged a sit-in to protest a decision to have a teenage Albanian girl carry the flag. Stephanopoulos will also go to southern Albania to visit the village of Dhrovian-where his great-grandfather was born and lived until he moved to Greece in 1829.

Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis pledged support on September 13, 2006, for Albania's efforts to join the EU and NATO, following talks with his visiting Albanian counterpart. Karamanlis said Athens "attributes great significance" to its northern neighbor's bids to join the organizations. Greece is already a member of both. "We are ready to help (Albania) with its efforts to implement the necessary reforms and commitments it has undertaken to the European Union," Karamanlis said. The small Balkan country took its first step toward possible EU membership in June, signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement, and also hopes to be invited to become a full NATO member by 2008. Karamanlis and Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha also discussed ways of boosting economic and political ties, as well as police and military cooperation. Berisha who ends a two-day visit to Greece Wednesday said discussions included the rights of the ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania, and of the estimated 600,000 Albanian immigrants living in Greece. He said his government would "seriously discuss" a Greek proposal to establish a rail link between the two countries. Earlier on September 13, 2006, the two countries' energy ministers signed a deal on bilateral energy cooperation.

Greece and Albania-even though diplomatic relations were restored in 1971-normalized relations only in 1987 as until then both countries were officially-in a cease-fire-but nevertheless under the state of war since Albania and Italy had declared war on Greece on 28 October 1940. During rule of dictator Enver Hoxha relations were strained because of the part that Albania played during World War II against Greece and also because of the material help that they provided to Greek communists during the Greek civil war. In addition there was controversy about the treatment of the Greek minority in southern Albania and the Cham issue. After the fall of the Albanian socialist regime in 1991, relations between the two countries got better but soon begun to deteriorate with accusations about mistreatment of minorities vice versa. To the latter problem it was added the widespread phenomenon of waves of illegal immigration from Albania towards Greece. High criminality numbers from one hand and alleged police brutality from the other became familiar subjects on the news of both neighbors, increasing eventually tensions. According to official Greek data around 450,000 Albanian immigrants work in Greece and it is believed the number will almost double if illegal immigrants are accounted too. This is a brand new situation, for both countries as Greece for the first time become a destination country for immigrants and Albanians for the first time got out of their country after the total isolation that the communist regime had imposed. In 2006, relations between the two countries are relatively good, and, at the Albanian Government's request, about 250 Greek military personnel are stationed in Albania to assist with the training and restructuring the Albanian Armed Forces. Albania's economy is over-dependent to the money immigrants from Greece sent back home while Greece is the second larger trading partner with more than USD $400 million worth of investments. Moreover Greek products account for 21% of Albania's imports with Greece absorbing 12% of its neighboring country's exports. At the same time low cost labor from Albania propelled Greek economy's growth especially in the construction and agriculture sectors.
