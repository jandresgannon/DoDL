Australia was engaged in direct warfare against N Vietnam in MID611 and this MID, MID1353, and this warfare was centered on territorial control (Doyle, Grey, and Pierce 2002). Coded not territorial because no territorial claim was occurring within this dyad, although Australia was linked to this dispute via its participation in the Vietnam War on the side of the US and S Vietnam, which also included fighting by Australians within this MID.
