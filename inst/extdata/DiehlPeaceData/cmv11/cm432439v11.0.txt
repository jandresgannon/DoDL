NARRATIVE-CR:
The basis of the rivalry between Mali and Burkina Faso (Upper Volta) was a dispute over an area of land called Beli-Agacher. When Upper Volta was established, there were several borders that remained vaguely marked. The Beli-Agacher area was one. In 1961, the two countries met and established a border demarcation commission, which decided that the region belonged to Upper Volta on December 7, 1961. While this settled the dispute for a time, in 1974 there were border clashes when Mali attempted to claim the region through force. These are classified as MID1411. The area, rich in manganese and possibly oil was considered important by both states. 

Both states agreed to a ceasefire on February 9, 1975, and on July 7, the two countries agreed to an OAU mediated agreement to settle the land dispute through a peaceful process, creating another demarcation commission in 1976. On October 20, 1983, Mali and Burkina Faso formally submitted the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ began deliberations on April 3, 1985.

As the 1970s arrived, Burkina Faso began to exert a much more radical and activist stance with its foreign policy. Under the leadership of Sankara, Burkina Faso became a major voice for anti-imperialism and development. The leftist stance stood in contrast to the very conservative leadership in Mali. Burkina Faso's desire to spread its revolutionary policies to neighboring states was an underlying issue in the disputes between the two countries over the next two years.

Meanwhile, there were more border clashes between the two states during 1985 and 1986. On December 25, 1985, the "Christmas War", or MID2583, began when Malian troops crossed the border because of demands by the Burkinabe civil service was demanding that all residents must have Burkinabe identity cards. While the two countries did sign a ceasefire agreement on December 30, 1985, hostilities did not completely terminate until July 15, 1986, after a resurgence of hostility during the early part of that month, classified as MID3629. 

On December 22, 1986 the ICJ issued its decision. The Beli-Agacher region was divided equally in two parts and allocated to Mali and Burkina Faso. 

On October 15, 1987, Sankara was assassinated. Compaore, who was behind the assassination, took power in Burkina Faso. Because Sankara had been more popular throughout Africa than he had been at home, Compaore began a large-scale effort to gain international favor and to explain the necessity for his coup. Relations with Mali became much better. In May of 1988, the two countries signed agreements on technical, scientific, and cultural cooperation.

In May of 1991, President Toure of Mali was overthrown. Burkina Faso immediately voiced solidarity withh the new regime, offered its condolences for the abuses of the Toure regime, and gave a gift of $175,000 to help Malian victims in their recovery. In 1993, President Konare of Mali paid two official visits to Burkina Faso, further strengthening their new ties.

The territorial dispute that was a central issue to this rivalry was resolved by the ICJ ruling in December 1986. Further, the leadership changes in both states appear to have brought about more moderate regimes that are willing to deal with one another in a peaceful manner. There has not been a dispute between these two states since July 1986, thus leading to the conclusion that the domestic changes as well as the ICJ settlement of the contentious territorial issue led to the termination of the rivalry.

Burkina Faso became independent on August 5, 1960 while Mali became independent on September 22, 1960. Mali and Upper Volta disputed the sovereignty of the Beli-Agacher region following the independence of Upper Volta on August 5, 1960. Malian and Upper Voltan representatives held negotiations on November 18-19, 1961, and the parties agreed to establish a border demarcation commission. On December 7, 1961, the border demarcation commission decided that the disputed region was a part of Upper Volta. Mali and Upper Volta established a border commission on February 24, 1964. It seems that the border between the two countries, especially in the regions of Soum and Beli, started to be disputes since their independence and according to the International Court of Justice documents previous disputes existed between the people inhabiting those lands before the independence of the two countries. Starting on November 28-29, 1961, a number of regular meetings were held between the two countries to demarcate the border between them. These were spurred by the occupation on November 28, 1961 by Malian soldiers of a piece of land in dispute on the northern side of Beli, from In Tuogoun to Fadar-Fadar. 900kms out of the 1380kms of border between the two countries were demarcated in a friendly and peaceful atmosphere from 1964 to 1968. A protocol signed in Bamako on February 25, 1964 allows for the right of the citizens of both Mali and Burkina Faso, at the time Upper Volta, to use the lands in dispute between the two countries. There were numerous border crossings in the 1960s which are considered by the International Court of Justice as incidents. On November 17, 1962, Malian soldiers crossed the border into Burkina Faso in the region of Soum. In 1963 there were more incidents reported during which Malian soldiers crossed the border into Burkina Faso harassing the burkinabese population. A Burkinabese Parliament delegation went to learn more about these issues in December 2, 1963 in the region of Soum. On February 25, 1964 an agreement was signed between the two countries to regulate border crossings and to make sure that incidents like those which took place earlier in the 1960s will not continue. However, the incidents continued and on August 31, 1966 Malian citizens crossed over into Burkina Faso to steal cattle. On October 9, 1968, Burkinabese border guards attacked violently Malian citizens. On March 7, 1963, Malian soldiers and policemen confiscated inside the territory of Burkina Faso weapons which belonged to a Burkinabese citizen. Numerous meetings between officials of the two countries occurred during the 1960s. The Ministers of Interior met in Bamako in February 1964; the ministers of finance and commerce met in Bobo-Dioulasso in August 1966; the two presidents met in Orodara in 1968 and the ministers of interior met again in July 1972. All these meetings tackled the issues of the border dispute between the two countries. In August 1972, Malian gangs raised the Malian flag in Soum, inside the territory of Burkina Faso. The Malian Government offered an apology over the latest incident. The first MID of RIV1052, MID started in November 1974.

The last MID of RIV1052, MID3629, ended in July 1986. On August 11, 1986, the Burkinabe Defense Minister, Major Lingani made an official visit to Mali where he met with the Malian president, Traore. The discussion which took place in the aftermath of skirmishes between the two countries earlier in the year was labeled as positive by the press of the two countries. The leaders of Burkina Faso and Mali have accepted on January 22, 1987, December 1986's world court verdict on their border dispute, a press communique disclosed. This acceptance marks the end of the rivalry between the two countries. The 26-year-old border dispute in the 3,000-square-kilometer area between Burkina Faso and Mali, which triggered a 5-day war at Christmas 1985, was settled with the international court of justice verdict on December 22, 1986 by defining a new border for the disputed area. Both governments had agreed in September 1983 to submit their case to the international court of justice. Captain Thomas Sankara, president of Burkina Faso declared in a message to the world court that his country "accepts the judgment and undertakes to facilitate the procedures required for its implementation." he said the world court's judgment had assisted the two friendly peoples "to turn over a sad page in their history and engage themselves resolutely in a more noble combat-the struggle for economic independence and welfare of peoples." General Moussa Traore, president of Mali, also declared to the hague court that his government and people accept the judgment as "final and binding" and expressed their "complete willingness" to facilitate the task of world court experts who will assist the two countries in defining their new boundaries. The Malian president said "the government of Mali will spare no efforts to ensure that the fraternal peoples of Burkina Faso and Mali, who share an abundant historical inheritance, may make of their frontier areas, zones of development and peace."

On 12th March, 1990, the Malian head of state, Gen Moussa Traore, who is currently on a visit to the fifth region of the country, at Douentza, 800 km from Bamako, addressed ''fraternal greetings to the brotherly people and government of Burkina Faso''. Gen Moussa Traore, who was replying to a welcome address by the secretary-general of the Douentza wing of the Democratic Union of Malian People [UDPM] (the single, ruling party), stated that the leadership and people of Mali and Burkina Faso are firmly committed to the only battle worth waging-that of the development and socio-economic advancement of the peoples of the two countries. At Bandiangara, 740 km east of Bamako, President Traore said, in reply to a question on the Malian-Burkina Faso border demarcation issue, that there is no longer any fear of war and that Switzerland decided four years ago to fully bear the demarcation costs. The Malian President disclosed that several delegations of the International Court at The Hague have toured the border between the two countries, adding that all that remains to be done is to place the boundary posts. Douentza, located on the border with Burkina Faso, is the chief town of the Mondoro administrative district under which comes the Dioulouna village where, in the past, clashes between the Malian and Burkinabe armies over the Agacher Strip broke out in December 1985.

On July 13, 1991, during the friendly working visit that the chairman of the Malian Transitional Committee for the People's Salvation [CTSP] recently paid to Burkina Faso, said that cooperation between Mali and Burkina Faso is sound. Bilateral cooperation and subregional integration were thoroughly discussed. In an interview with the Malian press during that visit, the Burkinabe head of state, Capt Blaise Compaore said that Mali and Burkina Faso must explore new ways and take initiatives for the construction of the Economic Community of West African States. Burkinabe Prime Minister Youssouf Ouedraogo paid a friendly and working visit to Mali on December 31, 1992. He held a working session with Younoussi Toure, his Malian counterpart, and was received by President Alpha Oumar Konare. Their discussions centered on strengthening bilateral cooperation and Burkina Faso's desire to help Mali solve the problem in the north. Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare returned to Bamako on June 26, 1995, after a 48-hour friendly and working visit to Burkina Faso. The aim was to inform the Burkinabe authorities and our fellow citizens living there of the efforts being made in our country for peace and for the return of the displaced persons. Malian President Konare expressed satisfaction with the visit, which was a success in all respects.

On July 13, 1995, the fourth session of the Mali-Burkina Faso interministerial meeting ended at Bobo-Dioulasso yesterday. For 72 hours, border authorities of the two countries examined issues relating to the wellbeing of border inhabitants. For three days running, discussions focused on issues relating to security, customs fraud, the return of displaced Malians living in Burkina Faso and border demarcation. Measures aimed at consolidating past achievements in these different sectors were adopted to promote border cooperation between the two countries. Chiefs in the border areas were encouraged to persevere in their cooperation efforts through the holding of several meetings. Thus cooperation on the level of twinning between Malian and Burkina Faso localities will be consolidated with the establishment of new holiday resorts. More than 200 km of the borderline delimited by The Hague Court of Justice have been demarcated. To date, 71 km remain to be demarcated, and this will be done after the rainy season. The two ministers of Mali and Burkina Faso expressed satisfaction with the spirit in which the meeting took place. Lt-Col Sada Samake, the Malian minister of territorial administration and security, appreciated positively the sound execution of the census operation being carried out among his displaced compatriots in Burkina Faso. In sum, this fourth interministerial meeting served as an opportunity to reaffirm a common destiny for when two countries are linked together by a common border stretching over 1,200 km, the only policy worth pursuing is that of cooperation, in order to vanquish the ills that impede development.

The President of Mali, Alpha Omar Konare, arrived in Ouagadougou on November 19, 1999 for a brief solidarity and working visit. Konare, who briefly discussed with Burkinabe President, Blaise Compaore, at Ouagadougou international airport, later told reporters that his visit formed part of routine contacts between the two countries sharing common borders, and comprising populations knitted by similar historical, cultural and economic realities. "Current preoccupations require that, from time to time, we discuss and consult with each other, since the upcoming implementation of the common external tariff of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) involve the economic actors and operators of the area," Konare said. Burkina Faso's gendarmerie commander, Colonel Mamadou Traore, warned on August 27, 2001, that his command would not allow any group to destabilise neighboring Mali. "We want to ensure our Malian brothers that our territory cannot be used to undermine the stability there," he told reporters in the Burkina Faso capital, Ouagadougou. Traore is the chief of staff of the gendarmerie, a paramilitary unit in charge of security across the nation. His statement came two days after gendarmes arrested Allassane Ould Mohamed, the leader of the Tuaregs, at a former refugee camp in Djibo Mentao, 200 km north of Ouagadougou. Mohamed's arrest was announced on Saturday. His wife told IRIN that her husband had been arrested because of an interview he gave to the international media earlier in the week. On 20 August, Mohamed said that some 2,000 Tuaregs had been abandoned by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since the official repatriation of Tuareg refugees ended in 1997. Mohamed demanded that the UNHCR and the Mali government provide the former refugees US $3 million for their return home otherwise they would "take action". He said the Tuaregs were not prepared to go back as beggars. "The Malian Embassy in Ouagadougou was embarrassed by Mohamed's declaration and really took his threats seriously," an official at the Burkina Faso Minister of Security told IRIN. "We must be cautious this time because during the rebellion we were often accused of siding with the rebels," the official, who demanded he not be identified, added. The deputy coordinator of the UNHCR office in Ouagadougou, Marguerite Camara, said those who had chosen to remain after the official end of repatriation were no longer refugees. In addition, she said, they ignored advice to report to the Foreign Ministry to regularise their status in Burkina Faso. During the peace talks to end the Tuareg rebellion against the Mali government, most rebel leaders lived in Burkina Faso. Thousands of people, mostly Tuaregs, fled fighting between the Tuareg and the army in northern Mali in the early 1990's. Following a peace agreement in 1994, about 20,000 of the 25,000 Tuareg refugees in Burkina Faso were repatriated under a UNHCR-sponsored program.
