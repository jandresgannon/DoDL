CIVWARMID-CER: MID4251 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4251 from cm narrative, Nigeria intervened on behalf of Sierra Leone's ousted government (which was removed from power on 5/25/97 by rebel forces), occupying and fighting in Sierra Leone for almost one year. The dispute ends after Nigeria successfully removes the rebel government and restores power to the ousted regime. Nigeria received support from Ghana and Guinea, pulling those countries into this MID. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to a civil war in Sierra Leone, outside this dyad.

Nigeria intervenes on behalf of Sierra Leone's ousted government (removed from power on 5/25/97 by rebel forces), occupying and fighting in Sierra Leone for almost one year. The dispute ends after Nigeria successfully removes rebel government and restores power to ousted regime. Nigeria operated under the auspices of ECOWAS; but, with the exception of minimal support from Ghana and Guinea, Nigeria was basically operating unilaterally. First day of dispute was on 5/27/1997 and last day of dispute was on 3/10/1998.
