TERRMID: MID182 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID182 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID182 from Gibler 2018, Japan was still pursuing colonial expansionism in Mongolia, and Mongolia was receiving support from the Soviets. In 1936-1936, Japan fought with Mongolian troops along the Mongolian border. Soviet Union is pulled into this MID due to its support of Mongolia. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Mongolia and Japan, as Japan was seeking to control Mongolia's territory.

RIVNOTES:

NARRATIVE-CM:
Japan and Mongolia agreed to established diplomatic relations on February 19, 1972.

SOURCES-CM:
Keesing, March 18-25, 1972.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the Mongolia and Japan is embedded in the larger rivalry that exists between the USSR and Japan. At the time of the rivalry from 1935 until 1945, Mongolia was a client state of the USSR. Japan had imperialistic/expansionist designs on Siberia/Mongolia. In addition, the border between the USSR, Manchukuo/Manchuria (a Chinese puppet state of Japan) was poorly demarcated.

The poorly defined borders sparked a border incident MID182, from December of 1935 until the end of March 1936. Here there were a series of skirmishes along the Manchukuo-Siberian frontier. Shots were fired between border troops with no record of casualties.

MID183 occurs from the end of May 1939 until the middle of September 1939. Here the Japanese and the Soviet Union fought a fierce, large-scale undeclared war in Mongolia that ended with a decisive Soviet victory. Hereafter Japan reoriented its strategic emphasis toward the south, leading to war with the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands; and Russia freed itself from the fear of fighting on two fronts, thus vitally affecting the course of the war with Germany. This is referred to in the MID Data set as the Nomahan War however; it is referred to elsewhere as the Nomonhan War or the Russo-Japanese War. Nomonhan is a city near the Manchukuo/Mongolia border.

MID183 and MID2725 are the MIDs associated with Mongolian entry into World War II (MID258) on the side of the USSR. Mongolian leader Mr. Soong declared war on Japan while on a visit to Moscow. The Mongolian People's Republic entered the war on 10 August 1945. This was one day after the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and two days after the USSR declared war on Japan. The USSR then invades Manchuria and occupied the northern half of Korea.

The rivalry between Mongolia and Japan ends with the end of World War II. Japan is a defeated and occupied state in September of 1945. The rivalry between the USSR and Japan continues however see cm365740.
