The disputed Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands were a source of tension for China and Japan. Japan asserted its claim over the islands by dispatching several coast guard vessels and planes to the island to prevent Chinese activists from landing on it, regularly patrolling the waters just outside of what is conventionally seen as the extent of Chinese territorial waters. In one particular incident, Japanese ships and planes attacked two Chinese fishing boats near the islands. First day of dispute was on 6/23/2003 and last day of dispute was 3/27/2004.

RIVNOTES: 

RIV1297, i.e., MID2966, was combined into RIV11298 from 1978 through 1999-, MID4061, MID4062, and MID4180 in riv510 dataset. The later two rivalries are combined because the issue that Japan and China fight over remains consistent throughout both rivalries. They engaged in four disputes over the Senkaku Islands from 1978 through 1999. The rivalry that takes place prior to 1958-RIV1296-has a different character. The central issue motivating this longer rivalry (1873-1958) is Japanese expansion onto the Asian mainland particularly into China. Thus, there are two distinct periods in the rivalry that suggests that there should be two rivalries-one pre 1958 and one post 1958.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between China and Japan has two phases. The first has a number of proximate causes but the issue at stake in the rivalry is the Japanese imperial expansion onto the Chinese mainland. The second phase of the rivalry is in the years after World War II. In this phase, Japan is severely limited in the activities it can pursue having been defeated in the war. China on the other hand has replaced Japan as the regional hegemon and disputes the Japanese claim to an island chain between the two countries. This more minor set of disputes in terms of level of hostility and the frequency of disputes is what makes up the second phase of the rivalry which has not yet concluded. 

Phase I:

MID2199 occurred in June of 1873. In 1871, a Japanese ship wrecked off the coast of Formosa. Over fifty Japanese sailors were able to make it ashore on Formosa, but were soon after decapitated by the aboriginals living on the island. The Japanese retaliated by threatening to annex Formosa. The Chinese who maintained sovereignty over the island, acquiesced and agreed to pay compensation for the deaths. MID1489 is titled the Formosan expedition and I believe this dispute is related to MID2199 but the two are not coded as linked in the MID3.021 dataset. I was not able to find direct reference to mutual displays of force between China and Japan (and Japanese use of force) during the period of this dispute (April through December of 1874). 

MID2200 or the Occupation of Ryukyu Islands occurred from March through December of 1875. The Ryukyu Kingdom was once an independent kingdom. In the 1600s, it obtained status as an offshoot of the Chinese empire. A 1609 expedition from Satsuma captured the Kingdom. After that, the kings of the Ryukyus paid tribute to the Japanese emperor as well as the Chinese emperor. In 1875, the Meiji government in Japan forcibly occupied the island group. 

MID2201 or the Annexation of Ryukyu Islands occurred in 1879. In 1879, the Meiji government announced the annexation of the Ryukyus. China objected and the ex-President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant was asked to arbitrate. He decided that Japan's claim to the islands was stronger and ruled in Japan's favor.

MID2202 or the Korean Mutiny occurred from July 31-August 28 1882. This is also referred to as the Imo Soldiers Mutiny. This mutiny occurred in Seoul and resulted in the deaths of several Japanese diplomats and officers. The Chinese garrisoned troops in Seoul in response. 

MID1486 is called the Korean Coup attempt and occurred from 12/4/1884 until 4/18/1885. A small group of politically frustrated Korean aristocrats in the early 1880s came under the influence of a Japanese educator, Fukuzawa Yukichi. This group of Koreans saw themselves as the forefront of Korea's "enlightenment' and advocated for release from Chinese control of Korea. This group led by Kim Ok-kyun were impressed by the Meiji Restoration. They sought to stage a coup d'etat in 1884 with about 200 Japanese legation soldiers. Resident Chinese troops quickly suppressed it. 

MID1488 occurred in October and November of 1885 and it is called the `Korean Invasion Rumor'. Korea requested American officers to train its troops, but Dennett (1923) states that this request was never granted. There was naval action by the British and Russians in April 1885, in an effort to deter the Japanese from invading. 

MID1490 is called the Sino-Japanese War and it occurred from June 5 1894 until March 30 1895. Japan and China fought the first Sino-Japanese War during 1894 and 1895, primarily over control of Korea. Korea had traditionally been a tributary state to China. In 1875 the Qing Dynasty of China had allowed Japan to recognize Korea as an independent state. However, China continued to try to assert influence over Korea, and public opinion in Korea split, with conservatives wanting to retain a close relationship with China while reformists wanted Korea to modernize and to have a closer relationship with Japan. Following the assassination of a pro-Japanese reformist in 1894, a Korean religious sect, the Tonghak, began the Tonghak Peasant Revolution. The Korean government requested help from China in suppressing it. When China contributed assistance, the Japanese government sent an expedition in support of the reformists, and had seized the royal palace in Seoul by June 8, 1894. War between Japan and China was officially declared on August 1, 1894, though some naval fighting had already taken place. The more modern Japanese army defeated the Chinese in a series of battles around Seoul and Pyongyang, forcing them north, and by November 21 the Japanese had taken Port Arthur (now known as Lushun). The Japanese navy devastated China's northern fleet off the mouth of the Yalu River at the Battle of Yalu on September 17, 1894. The Chinese fleet lost 8 out of 12 warships, retreated behind the fortifications of the Weihaiwei naval base, and was then caught by a surprise Japanese land attack across the Liaodong Peninsula, which shattered the ships in harbour with shelling from the landward side. After Weihaiwei's fall on February 2 and an easing of harsh winter conditions, Japanese troops pressed their advance into Manchuria. Faced with these repeated defeats China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in April, 1895.

MID31 is the Boxer Rebellion that occurred from May through August of 1900. Conservative opponents of reform in China gave clandestine backing to the anti-foreign and anti-Christian movement of secret societies known as Yihetuan (Society of Righteousness and Harmony). The movement has been better known in the West as the Boxers (from an earlier name-Yihequan, Righteousness and Harmony Boxers). In 1900, Boxer bands spread over the north China countryside, burning missionary facilities and killing Chinese Christians. Finally, in June 1900, the Boxers besieged the foreign concessions in Beijing and Tianjin, an action that provoked an allied relief expedition by the offended nations that included the Japan. The Qing declared war against the invaders. The insurgents finally fell to an international force eventually numbering 45,000 Japanese, United States, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Russian and anti-Boxer Chinese troops, which captured Tianjing on July 14 and Beijing on August 14. Under the Protocol of 1901, ten officials of the rebellion were executed and hundreds more were punished. The Legation Quarter was expanded and the Chinese were made to pay war reparations and agreed to the stationing of foreign troops in China. 

MID2203 or the `South Manchurian Railroad' occurred in October and November of 1907. Here the South Manchurian Railroad refused to deliver Chinese mail unless it was sent through the Japanese post. The South Manchuria Railway Company was founded by Japan in 1906, after the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and operated in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. From 1906 or 1910 until 1925, the company also operated the Korean railway system. This company developed soy beans and mineral resources and brought to Japan by its railway. It also built hotels, schools, libraries, etc for Japanese immigrants. It was occupied by the Soviet army in 1945.

MID2204 or `Chiento-South Manchuria Railroad' occurred from April to September of 1909. Here the Japanese attempted to work out an arrangement whereby the Chinese would cooperate with the administration of a military railway in China that Japan controlled. The Chinese delayed which caused friction and clashes during negotiations to resolve the dispute. 

MID260 occurred from 9/26/1914 to 9/25/1915 and is called the twenty one demands. Seizing the opportunity of Berlin's distraction with the European War and wanting to expand its sphere of influence in China, Japan declared war on Germany in August 1914 and quickly occupied German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province and the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall islands in the Pacific. With its Western allies heavily involved in the war in Europe, Japan sought further to consolidate its position in China by presenting the Twenty-One Demands to China in January 1915. Besides expanding its control over the German holdings, Manchuria, and Inner Mongolia, Japan also sought joint ownership of a major mining and metallurgical complex in central China, prohibitions on China's ceding or leasing any coastal areas to a third power, and miscellaneous other political, economic, and military controls, which, if achieved, would have reduced China to a Japanese protectorate. In the face of slow negotiations with the Chinese government, widespread anti-Japanese sentiments in China, and international condemnation, Japan withdrew the final group of demands, and treaties were signed in May 1915. Japan made it clear to China that if she did not agree to the modified list of demands Japan would make war on China. 

MID2205 or the Zhengjiatun Incident occurred from August 1, 1916 until April 13 of 1917. This is a minor incident in which some Chinese soldiers assaulted a Japanese policeman. The Japanese retaliated and several soldiers on both sides were killed. 

MID1777 or `Chinese Eastern railroad II' occurred from April of 1918 until July 19, 1919. The events during this dispute are those that coincide with World War I. China is not coded as a participant in World War I thus, the separate dispute here. Japan took the opportunity of the War in Europe to press its claims in China during the first World War. At this point, Japan was extending its imperial claims in China and the war among the Great Powers in Europe provided a significant distraction to the European states. Japan pursued its claim to territorial rights to railroads linking territory under Japanese control. 

MID2701 occurred in August, September, and November of 1919. This dispute is titled the `Chinese attempt to navigate the Amur river III.' Despite the specificity of the title of this dispute, I was not able to locate information on this dispute. 

MID1810 or the Fuzhuou incident occurred in December of 1919. I was not able to locate specific information regarding a dispute related to Fuzhou. 

MID2206 or `Chientao' occurred from June through October of 1920. This dispute is a dispute in which Japan is forcibly occupying portions of the Chinese mainland near Chientao. 

MID2207 or the Anti-Mukden Rebellion occurred in December of 1925. Here, the Chinese factions were engaged in heavy fighting near Mukden. A Chinese General, Yang Yu-tang, agreed to a deal with the Japanese in which they would provide troops to assist the Nationalist forces in the civil war with the Communist troops. 

MID2208 is called `Dagu (Taku) Harbor' and occurred March 15-18, 1926. This is a multilateral mid involving Germany, China, Japan, France, the UK, the US, the USSR and Italy. In this incident, the Great Powers demanded that China de-mine the Dagu Harbor as it provided access to a major river into China. The Great Powers jointly threatened military action if China did not acquiesce. China and Japan engaged in naval hostilities in which several seamen were killed on both sides during this period. 

MID145 occurred from January until March of 1927. Chinese Communists seized Nanjing (Nanking) and killed six foreigners in an attempt to discredit Chiang Kai-Sheik and the Nationalists. The international community raised a force of 40,000 troops to protect Shanghai. The nations that contributed to the troop deployments were: the UK, the USA, Japan, Italy, Portugal, Spain and France. 

MID2209 is called the Hankow incident and it occurred on April 2 and 3 of 1927. Here a minor incident occurred when Japanese sailors fired on a group of Chinese mobbing shops in Hankow. 

MID2210 or the Occupation of Tsinan occurred from May through August of 1927. 
The Japanese government dispatched troops to protect residents in Jinan (Tsinan), hindering the advance of Kuo Min Tang forces marching on Beijing.

MID40 occurred from 4/10/1928 until 11/18/1928 and is called the Tsinan Clash. Nationalist Chinese troops fought with Japanese soldiers from Jinan (Tsinan) during the Nationalist offensive against Beijing. The Japanese government dispatched forces to Shantung in response to Nationalist Chinese preparations for an offensive into northern China. The Japanese temporarily seized control of the Chinese railways.

MID129 is the Manchurian War. This dispute took place from 9/18/1931 until 5/31/1935. It began with the Mukden Incident. Japanese Army conspirators blew up a few meters of South Manchurian Railway Company track near Mukden (now Shenyang), and blamed it on Chinese saboteurs, and used the event as an excuse to seize Mukden. Japanese forces then attacked Shanghai in January 1932 on the pretext of Chinese resistance in Manchuria. Finding stiff Chinese resistance in Shanghai, the Japanese waged a three-month undeclared war there before a truce was reached in March 1932. Several days later, Manchukuo was established. Manchukuo was a Japanese puppet state headed by the last Chinese emperor, Puyi, as chief executive and later emperor. The civilian government in Tokyo was powerless to prevent these military happenings. Instead of being condemned, the Japanese Army's actions enjoyed popular support back home. International reactions were extremely negative, however. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, and the United States became increasingly hostile. From 1933 to 1935, Japanese forces invaded Chahar and Jehol, in Inner Mongolia, claiming it as a part of Manchuria (January-March); the Chinese were forced to withdraw from Tientsin. MID2211 (the Chahar Occupation) and MID139 (Jehol) also took place in this period and were a part of the general Japanese expansion onto the Asian mainland. 

MID2212 occurred from 5/20/1935 until 6/10/1935 and is called the Ho-Umetsu Agreement. This dispute is related to MID2213 that occurred from 6/13/1935 until 6/27/1935. It is called the China Daihara Agreemen. Both of these diputes are about Japanese concern for guaranteeing their positions gained in the war with China. The Japanese Army felt that they did not want to show any partiality with either the Communists or the Nationalists who were fighting amongst themselves within China. The Army felt that they should maintain neutrality in accordance with an earlier agreement, the Tangku Truce of 1933. The conditions of this agreement were Chinese withdrawals from Japanese occupied territory in the north. Local Japanese commanders however did not feel comfortable with this and Generals Ho-Umetshu and Doihara made separate agreements with local Chinese Kuomintang commanders. In so doing, they used force in efforts to ensure the agreements were favorable to the Japanese position in the agreements. 

MID616 occurred in November of 1935. During November, Japan increased its land grab in China and took over five Northern provinces (Shantung, Hopei, Shansi, Suiyuan and Chahar). The Japanese had in mind the same aims they did when they established Manchuko in Manchuria: control of the territory with a puppet regime and significant autonomy granted to the local leaders. 

MID2214 began on 7/10/1935 with a clash of troops in a Chinese park over shooting practice and lasted throughout the year. This conflict was Japanese aggression towards Chinese on the mainland in their efforts to take Chinese territory. During this period of conflict the Chinese notably had difficulty uniting against the Japanese and at one point Chiang Kai Check was captured by the one faction of his army and forced to agree to a unified Nationalist/Communist campaign against the Japanese. 

MID157 or the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred on July 7, 1937 and is coded as lasting until December of 1941. The conflict here is a war between Japan and China that is also referred to as the Sino-Japanese War. It is coded as a war in the MID dataset. During night maneuvers, Japanese troops clashed with Chinese forces at Lukouchiao, near Beijing. The fighting quickly spread to other parts of China, which reflected Japanese preparations for a general war with China. The Japanese government did not declare war against China for technical reasons of international law. China and Japan formally declare war against each other after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The dispute is coded as terminated on December 7, 1941 at which point both states mutually enter World War II opposed to one another. 

MID258 is World War II. 

Phase II:

The 1951 Treaty of San Francisco formally ended Japan's involvement in World War Two. This treaty was not signed the the PRC as it was excluded from the treaty negotiations and the subsequent signing by the United States. Formally, the state of war was not ended until 1972 when Japan extended diplomatic relations to the PRC. In practice, however, Japan began to restore relations with China almost immediately following the signing of Treaty of San Francisco in spite of the reservations of the United States. An informal trade agreement was signed by both Japan and the PRC on June 1, 1952. While in September of 1952 Japan joined CHINCOM, the US committee to limit trade with the PRC, the Japanese Diet passed a unanimous resolution in July of 1953 calling for closer economic relations with the PRC. Between 1952 and 1958 four unofficial trade agreements were signed between the PRC and Japan. In 1958 relations suffered when Kishi Nobusake, a former member of the wartime government, visited Taiwan. In 1962, Japan and China formally agreed to classify trade between the two states into two categories. The second of these categories "Memorandum Trade" established offices in the two capitals which served as de facto missions between the countries until formal recognition in 1972. In 1978, China and Japan signed a "treaty of peace and friendship" that formally set aside past grievances. 

In spite of these cooperative efforts between the two states, there are a number of disputes between the two countries in the years after World War II. The character of the disputes between the two countries changed considerably however. Japan was occupied by the United States for a number of years. The issues in the disputes following World War II are all about territorial control of the Senkaku islands and the fishing waters associated with them. Thus, it seems that the disputes that follow the war constitute a new phase in the rivalry. The rivalry is no longer about Japanese regional hegemony but of Chinese regional hegemony and disputes over territory. 

MID3208 occurred from 12/14/1953 to 7/4/1954. The issue in this period was one of access to fishing waters. The Japanese pursued access to fishing areas adjacent to China. The Japanese came within ten miles of the Chinese coast. In an effort to brush the Japanese back, the PRC seized and fired on a number of Japanese fishing boats during this period. Three specific incidents are described below. On 12/15/1953, a fleet of PRC gunboats fired on four Japanese ships Southwest of Korea and seized one Japanese trawler. On 3/14/1954, a PRC patrol boat fired on a Japanese fishing boat that was fishing ten miles off the coast of Chekiang. On 7/4/1954, the PRC seized four Japanese fishing boats of the coast of Shanghai. 

MID2853 occurred on 5/7/1958. The PRC seized fourteen Japanese fishing boats with 170 fishermen aboard. The PRC claimed that these boats were encroaching on PRC fishing waters. The New York Times reported that the issue at hand was disagreement over the details of a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries. An issue noted was whether the PRC could fly the Red Chinese flag over its trade mission office in Tokyo. 

MID2966 occurred on 4/13/1978. This dispute was a display of force by the Chinese. The issue at stake in this dispute was territorial control of the Senkaku Island chain. The Chinese sent 38 fishing boats into the disputed waters to anchor and attempt to assert control over the region. The fisherman had small arms and displayed them to Japanese patrol boats that passed. 

MID4061 occurred on 8/21/1995. This dispute consists of two incidents that occurred in the same day when Chinese fighter planes approached the disputed Senkaku Islands and came close to violating Japanese airspace. Japan responded to the action by scrambling two fighters.

MID4062 occurred in July of 1996. This dispute consists of one incident-the Chinese deployment of two submarines to the Senkaku Islands. The Senkakus are an island group that was returned to Japan in 1972, but are claimed by China. The deployment occurred following recent activities by ultra-nationalist groups on the islands.

MID4180 occurred from May 14 until July 15 1999. This dispute consists of two incidents in which Chinese naval forces conducted naval exercises around the disputed Senkaku Islands. In the May 1999 incident, Japanese patrols spotted 12 Chinese warships cruising in waters around the Senkaku Islands, within Japan's exclusive economic zone. In the July 1999 incident 10 Chinese vessels were sighted near the Senkakus conducting drills. This dispute occurred within Japan's exclusive economic zone.

SB-CR:
China (People's Republic of China) / Japan Years: 1874-1951 Issues at stake: Japanese presence on Asian mainland, including Manchuria and Korea; control of Formosa and Ryuku islands. End coding: On September 8, 1951, Japan signed the Treaty of San Francisco, affirming the terms of its 1945 surrender, giving up any claims to the Chinese mainland or to special status in China. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 11. Last militarized dispute: 1945 (WWII). Wars: 1894-1895, 1900, 1931-1933, 1937-1941, 1941-1945. Summary: While the specific stakes of the Sino-Japanese conflict have been various pieces of territory, the rivalry can somewhat more generally be thought of as over who is the predominant Asian power. The start of the rivalry dates to a dispute over Formosa and the Ryuku Islands. Disputes over the Ryuku islands continued through the late 1800s, and tension over influence in Korea grew with a Japanese-sponsored coup attempt in Korea in 1885. Korean tensions escalated to the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-1895, in which Japan captured Port Arthur (in Manchuria) and most of Korea but was forced to withdraw by Britain, France, and Russia. Japan recaptured Korea and extended its control in Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905, and formally incorporated Korea in 1910. Disputes between China and Japan continued through WWII, with Japanese intervention in the Chinese civil war of 1927 and repeated attempts by the Japanese to extend their empire in Manchuria. The rivalry between Japan and China ends only after Japanese defeat in WWII. The 1945 armistice agreement limited Japanese sovereignty to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and some minor islands, and stated that the USSR would administer the Kurile islands and the southern part of Sakhalin island (leading to the ongoing rivalry between Japan and USSR, above). In the final WWII peace treaty with Japan, the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco, Japan renounced control of all of the territories it surrendered in the 1945 armistice, and explicitly renounced any "special rights" in China. Since 1951, Japan has not dispute any Chinese claims to the areas (Korea, Manchuria, Formosa) that were previously in dispute. In 1952 the Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan/Formosa signed a separate peace treaty with Japan reaffirming the 1951 settlement. The People's Republic of China did not sign the 1951 treaty, as neither the PRC nor the ROC were invited to the San Francisco peace conference. Diplomatic relations between China and Japan were not restored until 1972, and in 1978 Japan and the PRC signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship. However, because the Japanese gave up all claim to the issues in dispute in the 1951 treaty, and because no disputes after 1945 over those issues occurred, I code 1951 as the end date of the Sino-Japanese rivalry. Notes: In 1978 the COW dispute data set shows a minor dispute over the Senkaku islands, followed by the 1978 signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the PRC. The 1951 Peace Treaty is used because the islands were not a central part of the issues at stake earlier in the rivalry. Additionally, there were no disputes related to those islands between 1945 and 1978. COW also has minor disputes in 1953 and 1958. Both of these involved the seizure of fishing boats which were quickly released, and not related to territorial claims by either side. Sources: Grenville (1974), Kinder and Hilgemann (1978).

In the final WWII peace treaty with Japan, the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco, Japan renounced control of all of the territories it surrendered in the 1945 armistice, and explicitly renounced any "special rights" in China. The Treaty was signed on September 8, 1951, in San Francisco. Since 1951, Japan has not dispute any Chinese claims to the areas (Korea, Manchuria, Formosa) that were previously in dispute. In 1952 the Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan/Formosa signed a separate peace treaty with Japan reaffirming the 1951 settlement. The People's Republic of China did not sign the 1951 treaty, as neither the PRC nor the ROC were invited to the San Francisco peace conference. Nevertheless the treaty directly impacted China's foreign policy. The last MID of RIV1296 ended on May 7, 1958. On February 8, 1961, China and Japan re-started their trade relations after a 18 months break. The level of bilateral trade was still minimal, but Japan's Diet suggested that relations should be enlarged as it was a matter of time before China will be accepted as a member of the United Nations.

Two minor MIDs occurred in the 1950s. MID3208 occurred from 12/14/1953 to 7/4/1954. The issue in this period was one of access to fishing waters. The Japanese pursued access to fishing areas adjacent to China. The Japanese came within ten miles of the Chinese coast.

On December 5, 1964, Japan's Prime Minister, Eisaku Sato, pledged the need to improve relations with China. However, the Chinese state-run media called this as a propaganda stunt. Nevertheless, an official Chinese trade representative signed a significant amount of deals with Japanese industrialists worth several billion dollars. It was estimated that the trade between Japan and China will amount to 150 million USD each way in 1965, an increase of 25 million from 1964. China accused Japan for offering US the possibility to have nuclear bases in Japan in 1966. Despite the accusations trade continued to increase. On April 18, 1970, China and Japan announced to have reached an accord on their semi-official trade treaty. On September 29, 1972 China and Japan signed Joint Statement on normalization of the bilateral relations. On September 29, 1972, China and Japan signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations. The agreement also established trade relations between the two countries. In the years between 1972 and 1978 a large number of trade agreements were signed between the countries on such issues as steel trade, fuel and other commodities. On January 5, 1974, China and Japan signed a trade agreement in Beijing. On April 18, 1975, the mixed trade committee between China and Japan opens its first joint meeting in Beijing. On February 16, 1978, China and Japan sign a long-term trade agreement in Beijing. On February 16, 1978, China and Japan signed a USD $20 billion trade pact in Beijing that set the scene for marked improvements in their diplomatic and political relations and is a welcome economic plum for Japan. For Japan, the major eight-year pact, which is an agreement between China's government and a group of Japanese industrialists, allows it a head start into China's vast market.

MID2966 occurred on 4/13/1978. This dispute was a display of force by the Chinese. The issue at stake in this dispute was territorial control of the Senkaku Island chain. The Chinese sent 38 fishing boats into the disputed waters to anchor and attempt to assert control over the region. The fisherman had small arms and displayed them to Japanese patrol boats that passed. On July 20, 1978, it was announced that a new era was opened in the Sino-Japanese relations. The two countries which remained at arms' length for 29 years following the 1949 revolution in China were currently planning a mass of joint industrial projects. On August 12, 1978, the Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua and his Japanese counterpart Sunao Sonoda signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship Between the People's Republic of China and Japan. On October 22-29, 1978, the Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited Japan. China and Japan exchanged instruments of ratification of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the People's Republic of China and Japan on October 23, 1978. The treaty formally becomes effective.

On June 1, 1979, the Sino-Japanese relations have noticeably deteriorated over the Senkaku Islands dispute. This deterioration has been triggered off by Japan's construction of a heliport on Uotsuri Island and the dispatch of a 31-man survey team there. Peking lost no time in lodging a formal protest with Japan. Sheng Ping, Director-General of the PRC Foreign Ministry Asian Affairs Bureau, expressly criticized the Japanese Government for having trampled underfoot the mutual understanding between the two sides. However, nothing in Peking's behavior indicates that there has ever been a mutual understanding on the Senkakus issue. Peking does not now conceal its plan to take possession of the Senkaku Islands. The Peking leadership claims ownership of nearly all the small island groups in the East and South China Seas. In accordance with this plan, Peking does not want to give up its hopes of seizing the Senkaku Islands. According to predictions by the UN and a Japanese survey team, the area around the Senkaku Islands is believed to have rich oil deposits.

When the uproar caused in autumn 1978 by the Chinese armed demonstration around these islands subsided, Peking thought it would be best to shelve the dispute for the time being. At that time, Peking needed more than anything else to conclude and ratify a peace and friendship treaty with Japan. And so the territorial issue was frozen. In conciliatory tones, PRC Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping said: "The present generation does not have the wisdom to settle the question of sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands. Therefore it will be better to shelve this question." At present the Peking leadership is very edgy about any action taken by Japan to confirm its ownership of the Senkaku Islands. How will the Sino-Japanese dispute develop? Will Peking confine itself to protests through diplomatic channels? Or will it resort to violence as it did last autumn? As in the case of the disputes with India and Vietnam, it is hard to predict how Peking will act towards its neighbors. As you know, China does not want to return the 37,000 square kilometers of Indian territory which it seized in 1962. At the recent Hanoi talks, the Chinese delegation demanded that Vietnam abandon the Xisha and Nansha Islands. The Chinese newspaper 'Guangming Daily' has reported that China has built heliports on the Xisha Islands-which it seized from Vietnam-for military and civilian use. All this indicates that the Peking Government's claim to the Senkaku Islands is not accidental, but in line with its overall expansionist plans.

On 6th November, 1982, Liao Chengzhi, Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, met a delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association led by Tokuma Utsunomiya, Chairman of the Association's national headquarters and member of Japan's House of Councillors. Sun Pinghua, Vice-President of the China-Japan Friendship Association was present.

The Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said in Tokyo on March 16, 1984, that Japan believes its current basic policies on the Japanese-Chinese relations should be continued generation after generation. Japan and China, the two countries with different social systems, have promised to carry their long-term friendly relations into the next century. Such relations will become an example of peaceful coexistence among countries the world over and the basis for peace and stability between Japan and China, in Asia and the world as a whole, he said. The prime minister made the statement when meeting a visiting Chinese journalists delegation and resident Chinese correspondents in Japan. Nakasone said that relations between Japan and China have been pushed to a new stage after the Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang's visit to Japan. He said that during his visit to China beginning on March 23, 1984, he will have discussions with Premier Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary Hu Yaobang and Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission of the Chinese Communist Party Deng Xiaoping on the development of long-term and stable relations between Japan and China through to the next century. Nakasone said Japan and China are cooperating in the economic field on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and it is Japan's pleasure to be able to make some contributions to China's four modernizations. Concrete cooperation has been going on in scientific and technological areas such as telecommunications and atomic energy, he said. He added, the agreed Japanese loans to China are to expire soon and he has urged the departments concerned to speed up their study on offering new loans to China and on cooperation projects between the two countries before his visit to China.

The Japanese Foreign Minister Tadashi Duranari said in Beijing on June 27, 1987, that relations between Japan and China are good on the whole and differences and problems between them can be solved in the principles of the Japan-China joint statement and the Japan-China treaty of peace and friendship. Speaking at the fifth meeting of the cabinet members of Chinese and Japanese governments, the Japanese foreign minister said solid progress has been made in cooperative relations between the two countries in various fields since last meeting of the cabinet members of the two governments in 1985 and Japan-China friendship has become a huge trend. On the other hand, he said, several problems have cropped up in close relations between the two countries. But he expressed the belief that the two countries can solve such problems by exchanging views of the governments in the principle and spirit of the 1972 Japan-China Joint Statement and the 1978 Japan-China treaty of peace and friendship. He reiterated Japan's basic principles towards China. In the Japan-China joint statement, he said, the Japanese government expressed its introspection idea to the war in the past. This is the Japan's major premise for diplomatic relations with China and Japan will not waver on this in the future. Seeking peace and not to embark on the road of becoming a big military power constitute a basic policy of Japan, which enjoy the support of the Japanese people. On the question of Taiwan, Tadashi Duranri said, the Japanese government has since 1972 always adhered to this position: to develop and strengthen its friendly relations and cooperation with the People's Republic of China, the sole legitimate government of china which the Japanese government recognized. This stand will remain unchanged in the future, he said. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last month expressed clearly to the diet that it is irrefutable that there is only one China and there do not exist two Chinas. He said Japan's diplomatic relations with China are based on the above-said basis which is unshakable. If the Japan-China joint statement and the Japan-China peace and friendship treaty are the foundation for developing and enhancing the relations between the two countries in the future, then the guidelines should be the four principles-peace and friendship, equality and mutual benefit, mutual trust and long-term stability. Speaking of the future economic relations, Tadashi Duranri said, Japan-China economic relations have developed rapidly since the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1972. Japan and China are now becoming major trading partners of each other. Japan will make further efforts to promote economic relations between the two countries in accordance with the basic position of Japan-China friendship. He reiterated that this is an unswerving policy of the Japanese government. Japan regards it as its duty in international society to eliminate the imbalance in foreign trade and it has determined to readjust its economic structure and solve this problem, Duranri said. The Japanese government is also taking measures to expand its domestic need, imports and economic cooperation, he said.

On May 3, 1988, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen discussed the development of bilateral relations and international issues of common interest with his Japanese counterpart Sosuke Uno. This is Uno's first visit to China since he became Japan's foreign minister, and also his first meeting with China's newly-appointed foreign minister Qian. During this afternoon's three-hour meeting, Qian welcomed Uno on his official visit to China which coincides with the 10th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan peace and friendship treaty in 1978. Qian said he hopes Uno's visit will further promote bilateral relations. In response Uno said that developing Japanese-Sino relations is an important component of Japan's foreign policy. Uno reaffirmed Japan's policy towards China of continuously strengthening relations and cooperation in accordance with the Japan-China joint statement and Japan-China peace and friendship treaty as well as the four principles governing Japan-China contact. According to Qian, China's policy towards Japan is to continue developing long-term, stable and neighborly relations on the basis of the China-Japan joint statement, the China-Japan peace and friendship treaty and all agreements previously reached between the two countries. Qian also said, China has noticed Japan's Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has repeatedly expressed his desire to strengthen relations and cooperation with China since he took office. Qian reaffirmed China's stand on the "Kokario case," which involves a Chinese student dormitory in Japan, and Uno said Japan agrees the case is important and understands China's position. The two foreign ministers also talked about some recent incidents which were not favorable to Sino-Japanese friendship. Qian mentioned a Japanese cabinet member's impolite speech and said, "we hope the Japanese side will take note of this and handle it properly." On how to treat the history of Japan-China relations, Uno said, the Japanese government perseveres in the views and stand explained in the Japan-China joint statement. The incidents of defacing the late premier Zhou Enlai's monuments and the armed attack on China's consulate in Fukuoka were "extremely shameful," uno said with regret. Qian and Uno also discussed bilateral economic relations and trade, and mentioned progress made in these areas, while they also talked about the Kampuchean issue. The two ministers agree the time is right for the two countries to expand bilateral economic relations and cooperation and both hope for an agreement on investment protection to be signed soon.

Generally speaking, the current China-Japan relations are good, but they are not as good as we wish," the president of the China-Japan friendship association Sun Pinghua said on June 10, 1988. "So far as our subjective desire is concerned, it would be better that no trouble happens and still less artificial obstacles are placed upon the relations," sun continued, "however, actual facts often go contrary to our desire. Troubles often cropped up on the Japanese side so that China-Japan relations are covered with a shadow." His remarks came in an interview with the correspondents from china's "fortnightly" magazine. in his interview, entitled "Why are China-Japan Relations Always Bumpy?" he believed that there are three major obstacles on this matter. First, he said, there are always a number of Japanese who do not admit the historical fact that Japan committed aggression against China and other nations in Asia in the past.

On August 18, 1989, in a step that could lead to re-establishing normal relations with Beijing, Japan dropped its recommendation to business executives not to travel in China and said it was ready to lift a freeze on economic aid projects imposed after China's crackdown on dissidents in June 1989. Future aid for China, including the $6 billion program announced last year by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, remain suspended, officials said, although they said the Government was adopting a ''wait-and-see attitude'' on whether to let these go ahead. Japan is China's largest aid donor, and Tokyo's assistance is considered crucial for Beijing's hopes for economic growth. Japan is now at the end of a $3.3 billion aid program, although most of these projects were not completed when they were frozen in June. Japan is ready to resume these current projects ''on a case-by-case basis,'' officials said, provided the Chinese are ready to resume them. The action was the boldest step by the Japanese Government in its campaign to persuade other nations not to isolate China from the rest of the world by maintaining or increasing sanctions because of displeasure over Beijing's domestic policies. Japan's concerns about China were discussed at the conference of leaders of the major industrial democracies in Paris in July. Most leaders of the Western democracies were said to agree with President Bush that it was premature to resume economic assistance and normal ties. Officials acknowledged today that Japan's move could well be criticized by other nations and officials who have charged that Japan sometimes seems more interested in its business interests than in human rights. But Japan says it must take an unsentimental approach to its neighbors, especially China and the Soviet Union. These days, officials say Japan should be more concerned about Soviet intentions-especially what Japan sees as a large Soviet naval and troop presence in northeast Asia-and that China must be regarded realistically as an important counterweight to Soviet influence. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry announced the steps at a news conference today, followed by a formal lifting of the travel advisory to businessmen by the Transport Ministry. But officials said the travel restraint advisory would be maintained with relation to Beijing, because martial law continues to be in effect there. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the step today was being taken ''because the situation in China seems to have become normalized to a certain extent.'' There was no clear indication whether the move was a product of Japan's recent change in government, although the newly installed Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, made a point of emphasizing the importance of improving ties with China when he took office on August 9, 1989. After the crackdown on student dissidents in China, Japan was slow to condemn the Chinese authorities, saying that because of Japanese subjugation of China in the 1930's, Tokyo had to exercise caution and not revive anti-Japanese feelings among its neighbors. Later, Japanese officials acknowledged they were under pressure to express at least some outrage over China's actions, and some officials criticized Japanese business executives for rushing off to China to protect their business and trade ventures. The Foreign Minister at the time, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said then that people saw Japan as trying to make money ''like a thief at a fire'' and that businessmen should not appear to be so eager to make their deals. Japanese direct investment in China totals about $2 billion. Japan's position on China is not the first case in which Tokyo has argued against sanctions over political differences. Concerning Iran, Japan has long maintained that economic relations were a better way to stop terrorism than was the United States method of blockades and boycotts.

Bilateral trade between China and Japan grew markedly in 1992, which marked the 20th anniversary of normalization of the two countries. According to preliminary trade figures released by the Japanese Finance Ministry, the bilateral trade between the two countries totaled $28.9 billion in 1992, up 26.7 percent from the previous year. Japan's exports to China in 1992 grew by around 40 percent from a year earlier, chiefly attributed to a rapid economic growth in China, while Japan's imports from China went up by around 20 percent, with imports of finished products rising. Of Japan's total imports, China accounted for 7.3 percent in 1992, up 0.7 percentage points from a year earlier, and second only to the United States for the second year in a row. As a result, the China-Japan trade accounted for 5.05 percent of Japan's total trade in 1992, growing close to Japan's two-way trade figures with Germany, South Korea and Taiwan. Customs statistics released by Beijing show that the bilateral trade with Japan grew for the second consecutive year in a row in 1992, recovering to a level of around 15 percent of China's total trade. China's imports from Japan accounted for 17 percent, up more than 1 percentage point from a year earlier. At the 14th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, China made clear its stance of establishing a "socialist market economy," by dismantling the country's old order while promoting a shift to a market economy. The Chinese economy has entered a new development phase. As has been symbolized by China's move toward joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, China's efforts in entering the international market, including opening its own market further, have become more intense. Such development has led to a marked expansion in investment by Japanese private businesses in China. All things considered, the China-Japan trade has entered a new phase for expansion, leading to China becoming Japan's second biggest trading partner in one year or two, next to the United States. Aside from differences in nature and values, China and Japan are commonly faced with the growing trade surplus against the United States. Nonetheless, it is very important for the two Asian countries to strengthen bilateral trade links, which would not only promote the economic progress of the two countries but also contribute to the prosperity of the Asia and Pacific region. Various conditions surrounding the two countries make it necessary for the bilateral trade volume to expand further. If the bilateral trade expands from the current 5 percent of Japan's total external trade to 10 percent, Japan's trade dependency on the U.S. market will be reduced markedly. There are, however, some challenges lying ahead for the two countries to have the bilateral trade make a sustainable growth. Firstly, there is the issue of how to check the growth of the trade imbalance that formerly was in Japan's favor. In the 1990-1991 period China had the surplus. In the coming years, however, the bilateral imbalance is expected to turn into Japan's favor once again and to grow, because China's economy is expected to grow fast, and the country will cut tariffs and ease import restrictions in step with its planned entry into GATT.

Despite recent tensions between the two countries, Japan and China averted a political showdown during a visit to Japan by Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren from October 28 to November 4, 1994. Since Rong was the first high-ranking Chinese official to tour Japan since political temperatures rose between the two countries over Tokyo's increasing contacts with Taiwan, it was speculated that matters 'unpleasant' to discuss would be taken up during the bilateral talks. China's testing of nuclear bomb last month was also expected to be discussed in connection with Japan's implementation of a fourth set of yen loans for the 1996-2000 period. 'It's good enough that he is coming to Japan as scheduled,' a top Foreign Ministry official said prior to Rong's arrival in Tokyo late last month, referring to bilateral ties gone awry over Japan's decision to allow Taiwanese Deputy Premier Hsu Li-teh to attend the Oct. 2-16 Hiroshima Asian Games. China refrained from boycotting the Asiad but canceled the planned participation by State Councillor Li Tieying in the games and a separate trip to Japan by a Sichuan provincial delegation in protest to Japan's decision. It also frowned on a recent meeting between Japanese and Taiwanese trade ministers during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Osaka. Contrary to initial expectations, however, specific bilateral problems were not raised during Rong's separate meetings with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono. Instead, the talks focused on the principles of bilateral relations, with Rong telling Murayama that matters which 'obstruct good bilateral ties appear from time to time' but that China and Japan have basically enjoyed friendly relations since their normalization of diplomatic ties in 1972. Murayama, meanwhile, reassured Rong that Japan will not support 'two Chinas' and that it wants to develop relations with China based on the 1972 joint statement and the 1978 Peace and Friendship Treaty, in which Japan pledged to recognize Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China, severing ties with Taiwan. Tokyo has since limited its contacts with Taiwan to nongovernmental activities in such fields as economics and tourism. 'The visit by the Chinese vice president was purely a goodwill trip,' said a ministry official. 'Rong is also a symbolic figure of China's open reform policy,' the official said, explaining that he does not usually take part in practical business matters. 'We took into consideration his position and focused on discussing basic principles of bilateral relations.' But some China experts say there is more behind Japan's reluctance to raise the thorny subjects with China. They say one reason Japan cowers to Beijing is because Tokyo feels indebted for its wartime aggression and atrocities in China. Susumu Yabuki, professor at Yokohama City University, says there are 'various elements' as to why the Japanese government cannot speak strongly to China, including Japan's wartime activities. 'But most of all, it's because the politicians and bureaucrats are lax,' he said, adding frequent remarks by cabinet ministers denying Japan's wartime responsibilities, and later retractions, have discredited Japan. 'Japan still hasn't been able to sort various things out, including about the war,' said Yabuki. 'Because of such an irresponsible system, Japan can't speak strongly to other nations and is always thrown into confusion and always bows its head to other countries.' A senior Foreign Ministry official echoed such a Japanese position in relations with China. 'Sometimes we want to speak strongly to China like other aid donor countries are doing to some recipient countries,' the official said in regard to Japan's yen loans to China. 'But we can't afford to destroy our country by doing that.' Japan has repeatedly warned Beijing that nuclear testing could hinder Japan's economic aid because of its guidelines hammered out in 1992 on extending official development assistance (ODA), taking into account the recipient countries' trends regarding military spending and nuclear development. But China ignored such warnings and conducted its second underground nuclear test of the year on October 7. Japanese officials say that despite such developments, Tokyo cannot cut off economic aid to China because 'stable ties with China are indispensable for security in Japan and Asia as a whole.' 'Emotionally, we share the view that the loans should be halted,' said the senior ministry official. 'But we have to consider various factors.' The Chinese government is reportedly seeking Japanese assistance of some 1.5 trillion yen in five years to cover 69 projects, including a new airport in Shanghai and express railway lines between Beijing and Shanghai. The figure is nearly double the amount for the preceding six-year period from 1990, which was 800 billion yen. Japan, which has extended loans to China since 1979, has been suggesting that the maximum amount it can provide will be about 1 trillion yen.

Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sets out on May 2, 1995, for a visit to China for talks with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders. Japan and China have in recent years seen a remarkable deepening of mutually dependent relations. About 880,000 Japanese and Chinese visited each other's country in 1993, nearly 100 times the figure for 1972, when relations were normalized. Bilateral trade grew to $46.2 billion in 1994, putting China second only to the United States among Japan's trading partners. Japan tops China's list of trade partners. Japan's direct investment in China totaled $6.16 billion from fiscal 1979 to 1993, and Japan's funds have been applied to increasingly diverse areas. Japanese official development assistance to China totaled a little more than 1.55 trillion yen in the calendar years 1979-1993, contributing significantly to China's pursuit of its reform and open-door policies. Trends in China, with a population of 1.2 billion, are of key significance to Japan and affect its security, economic and environmental interests. Bilateral relations are also increasingly important, as stable Japan-China, Japan-U.S. and U.S.-China ties are essential to the peace and prosperity of Asia and the whole world.

The period starting in 1995 is characterized by the raising importance of the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands. There were three MIDs during this period. This territorial dispute was not solved as of December 31, 2006. The second issue of contention between the two countries has to do with the visits by Japanese Prime Ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors several Japanese war criminals that committed crimes against Chinese people during World War II. This has seriously damaged the feelings of the Chinese people and the people of other victimized countries, landing Japan-China relations in a difficult situation. The economic and trade relations kept improving, but the territorial dispute and the political issues over the Yasukuni Shrine make the current relations difficult.

The dispute over the Senkaku Islands had its first MID, MID2966 in 1978. MID2966 occurred on 4/13/1978. This dispute was a display of force by the Chinese. The issue at stake in this dispute was territorial control of the Senkaku Island chain. The Chinese sent 38 fishing boats into the disputed waters to anchor and attempt to assert control over the region. The fisherman had small arms and displayed them to Japanese patrol boats that passed. However, for most of the 1980s and part of the 1990s, the dispute was shelved, not settled. On June 1, 1979, in conciliatory tones, PRC Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping said: "The present generation does not have the wisdom to settle the question of sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands. Therefore it will be better to shelve this question." In 1995, the dispute flared up again.

MID4061 occurred on 8/21/1995. This dispute consists of two incidents that occurred in the same day when Chinese fighter planes approached the disputed Senkaku Islands and came close to violating Japanese airspace. Japan responded to the action by scrambling two fighters.

Japan responded to the action by scrambling two fighters.

MID4062 occurred in July of 1996. This dispute consists of one incident-the Chinese deployment of two submarines to the Senkaku Islands. The Senkakus are an island group that was returned to Japan in 1972, but are claimed by China. The deployment occurred following recent activities by ultra-nationalist groups on the islands.

The deployment occurred following recent activities by ultra-nationalist groups on the islands. On September 20, 1996, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a strong protest against the landing of Japanese rightists on the Diaoyu Island again.

The Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged Japan on November 13, 1998 to incorporate a clear position on Taiwan and an apology for its aggression in China in a joint statement to be issued during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's trip to Japan later in November 1998. Tang made the request in a meeting with Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, party officials said. Jiang will visit Japan from Nov. 25 to 30 following his visit to Russia on Nov. 22-25. It will be the first state visit by a Chinese head of state to Japan and the visit will take place to mark the 20th anniversary of the Japan-China peace and friendship treaty. Beijing toughened its stance on an apology for the 1937-1945 war in China following a joint declaration issued by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and South Korean President Kim Dae Jung during Kim's visit to Japan last month. In that statement, Obuchi expressed "deep remorse and heartfelt apology" for the "great pain and damage" Japan inflicted on the Korean people during its 1910-1945 rule of the Korean Peninsula. "The Japanese side is keenly aware of Japan's responsibility for causing enormous damage in the past to the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself," the 1972 Japan-China joint statement issued when the two countries normalized relations. China is also seeking a statement on Taiwan. In the 1972 Japan-China joint statement, Japan said it fully understands and respects China's position that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China."

Stronger military ties between Japan and the United States are the main shadow over an historic visit this week by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the first head of state from his country to visit Japan, reports Reuters on November 25, 1998. Jiang's six-day visit turns a new page in the often-frail relations between the two "superpowers" of Asia. "The stronger that military ties grow between Japan and the United States, than the more fragile becomes the relationship between Japan and China," said military analyst Haruo Fujii. Contrary to Chinese hopes, President Bill Clinton's visit to Japan the previous week ensured that the Tokyo-Washington military alliance was boosted to its highest level since the end of World War Two. In 1997 the two nations agreed on newly expanded bilateral defense arrangements to replace the 1978 Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation. Under the arrangements, Japan will take on a more wide-ranging military role in cooperation with the U.S. during emergencies in areas surrounding Japan. "Centring on the issue of Taiwan, China is nervously watching how Japan and the United States handle their security arrangements," Fujii said. "The bottom line is that the new guidelines get on the nerves of the Chinese." China fears the Japan-U.S. agreement is designed to protect Taiwan in the event of Chinese military action against the island, which Beijing regards as a rebel province. An irritated China has repeatedly warned Japan not to include Taiwan within the scope of its defense pact with the United States. Beijing says that would "violate and interfere in China's sovereignty and would be totally unacceptable to the Chinese government, people and armed forces". "China wants to weaken, if not to break up, the military alliance between Japan and the United States," said Terumasa Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University. "China believes that if Japan has more say over security issues, it will have a negative effect on China's policy and influence towards Asia" he said. Nakanishi said Sino-Japanese relations were showing signs of improving after a visit to China in 1992 by Japanese Emperor Akihito. But the revamped security ties between Tokyo and Washington have put a roadblock in the way of the improvement. Despite Chinese demands that Japan handle its military pact with Washington with "prudence", particularly on Taiwan, Tokyo was unlikely to give ground on the issue, Nakanishi said. "The guidelines and Japan's stance towards Taiwan are basic ingredients of Japanese security and foreign policy. Accepting the Chinese demands would mean a complete reversal of Japan's policy" Nakanishi said. He said Jiang was expected to urge Japan to follow the path Clinton took in Shanghai in July towards Taiwan. Clinton clearly enunciated for the first time what Taipei has dubbed Washington's "three no's" policy on Taiwan. Clinton told Jiang in their summit that "we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas' or one Taiwan, one China', and we don't believe Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement." "President Jiang is likely to press Prime Minister (Keizo) Obuchi to declare his own three no's policy on Taiwan. The question is how far Obuchi can go on this issue," Nakanishi said. "Isolating Taiwan is one of the main purposes of President Jiang's visit to Tokyo," he said. Apart from the Taiwan issue, Japan and China have long been locked in a sovereignty dispute over East China Sea islands known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China. Military analyst Fujii warned that the territorial dispute could trigger a regional military conflict. "Various issues between Japan and China, including the one on the Senkakus, could trigger a quagmire of a regional military conflict," Fujii said. Nakanishi and several other analysts said Jiang's visit to Japan was not "timely", because Tokyo and Beijing were on a collision course on several issues. "The timing of President Jiang's visit is not good at all. On many points in the mid and long terms, Japan and China are heading for a worse state of bilateral ties," Nakanishi said.

MID4180 occurred from May 14 until July 15 1999. This dispute consists of two incidents in which Chinese naval forces conducted naval exercises around the disputed Senkaku Islands. In the May 1999 incident, Japanese patrols spotted 12 Chinese warships cruising in waters around the Senkaku Islands, within Japan's exclusive economic zone. In the July 1999 incident 10 Chinese vessels were sighted near the Senkakus conducting drills. This dispute occurred within Japan's exclusive economic zone.

Japan is reviewing its aid to China because of the latter's rapid military buildup and economic growth, a foreign ministry official said on May 10, 2000. This was relayed by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono to Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan who is on an official visit to Japan, according to the official. Kono told Tang there had been calls in Japan for the government to review its official development assistance to China "in view of its high economic growth and military expansion," the official said. The Japanese minister called on China to "make efforts to enhance the transparency of its military spending," the official said. Kono said Japan needed to study its economic aid to China after 2001, when its current aid package expires, according to the official. "Japan will from now coordinate its view on yen-denominated loans to China," Kono said, proposing that Japanese and Chinese officials discuss the matter "at an appropriate date." Tang said Japan's official aid had made "great contributions to China's economic construction and China-Japan trade," according to the official. "We will make clear to the Japanese people the effects of the cooperation." Kono also called on China to resume a dialogue with Taiwan following the island's election of Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as its new president in March.

On July 4, 2001, Japan's trade negotiators said that two days of talks with China on their trade dispute had failed to make any progress and that the two sides would try to meet again "as soon as possible" to continue discussions on how to resolve the issue. Hitoshi Tanaka, director general of the Japanese foreign ministry, told reporters that Japan is sticking to its position on the imposition of temporary tariffs on imports of Chinese mushrooms, spring onions and tatame rushes which had sparked the trade row. "We are not in a position to lift the provisional tariff measures for policy considerations."

On 5 September, 2002, at his official residence, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi met with Song Jian, visiting vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president of the China-Japan Friendship Association CJFA, and a CJFA delegation led by him. During the meeting, Koizumi noted that Japan and China have a long history of friendly exchanges, and that the development of Japanese culture has been greatly influenced by Chinese culture. This year is the 30th anniversary of the normalization of Japan-China diplomatic relations, as well as the 30th anniversary of his political career. Koizumi said that having visited China, he felt that he is all the more responsible for promoting the development of friendly ties between Japan and China. Song Jian added that since the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations 30 years ago, tremendous progress has been made in their exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and non-governmental friendly exchanges have enjoyed the support of the two governments. Song Jian expressed the hope that the 30th anniversary of China-Japan diplomatic relations will be taken as a new opportunity to push for greater progress in the undertakings to promote China-Japan friendship. Song Jian stated that China and Japan are important countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and that maintaining the healthy and stable development of China-Japan relations not only serves the interests of the two peoples but also contributes to the peace and development of Asia and the world. Song hoped that according to the principles of the "China-Japan Joint Declaration," China and Japan will continue to carry forward and promote the undertakings pioneered by past generations, deepen mutual understanding, expand exchanges and cooperation, and open up new prospects for China-Japan friendly cooperation in the 21st century. Also present at the meeting were Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, Japan-China Friendship Association President Ikuo Hirayama, and Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei. At the invitation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the CJFA delegation led by Song Jian arrived in Tokyo on 4 September for the activities marking the 30th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations.

The Japanese government has leased land from a private owner in the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, government sources said on January 2, 2003. The move has sparked protests from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Government sources said the lease, which covers private lands on three Senkaku islands, was signed for a one-year period from April 1, 2002, through March 31 this year under a 22 million yen contract. The government intends to renew the lease this year, the sources said. The lease 'will show our firm stand that the Senkaku Islands are historical Japanese territory,' one government source said. The Senkaku Islands, known as Diaoyu islands in China or Tiaoyutai in Taiwan, are located in the East China Sea between Taiwan and Okinawa. News of the lease, first reported in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper has triggered protests in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. 'Any unilateral action taken by the Japanese side over these islands is null and void,' the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its official Web site. The Taiwan government said its sovereignty over the islands is 'unquestionable and indisputable.' In Hong Kong, a group of activists staged a protest outside the Japanese Consulate General and demanded that Japan immediately end its lease of the disputed islands. According to the Yomiuri, the lease was made with a man who owns the uninhibited islands of Uotsurishima, Minami-Kojima and Kita-Kojima. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said the lease is intended for 'effective use of national land.' There is, however, speculation that the government intends to keep the land under government control and prevent their sale to a third party. Japan drew criticism from China and Taiwan when a Diet member who belonged to the now defunct New Frontier Party landed on one of the islands in May 1997. Japan's Coast Guard blocked the lawmaker's attempt to land on the island again in September 1997, drawing criticism from activists who want the Japanese government to assert its sovereignty on the islands.

China is "gravely concerned" about Japan's decision to launch survey work in July 2004 on a natural gas field north of some islands in the East China Sea, which are also claimed by China, the official Xinhua news agency reported citing Zhang Qiyue, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry. Zhang hopes that "Japan will act prudently, fully considering the whole situation of bilateral relations and the stability of East China Sea region" and urged Japan not to take any action that "may imperil China's interest and complicate the current situation". Earlier in the week, Japanese authorities reportedly announced plans to dispatch a ship early this month and carry out research in Japan's exclusive economic maritime zone. The survey site is near a disputed chain of islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which lies between Taiwan and Japan. The islands are claimed by Tokyo, Beijing and Taipei.

Chinese officials have protested to Japan over a proposal before a city assembly in Japan's Okinawa Prefecture to designate a commemorative day marking Japan's claim to the disputed Senkaku Islands, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on March 24, 2005. China is paying 'serious attention' to the proposal Tuesday by an Ishigaki city assemblyman to set aside every Jan. 14 to commemorate the day the islands were brought into Okinawa Prefecture, spokesman Liu Jianchao said. The Senkaku Islands are part of Ishigaki city on Ishigaki Island, which is also part of Okinawa Prefecture. Chinese officials have expressed their 'stern position' to Japan through diplomatic channels, Liu said. A Japanese Embassy spokesman confirmed that Chinese officials had lodged a complaint Wednesday in Beijing. The Senkakus, in the East China Sea about 400 kilometers west of Okinawa Prefecture's capital Naha, are controlled by Japan and also claimed by China and Taiwan. The uninhabited archipelago, known as the Diaoyu islands in China, is rich in fish resources and strategically important geographically. 'For the Japanese side to take any unilateral action toward the Diaoyu Islands is a severe violation of China's territorial claims,' Liu said. 'It's all illegal and ineffective. China resolutely opposes it.' The 'Senkaku Islands Day' proposal has yet to be approved, and Ishigaki Mayor Nagateru Ohama opposes it. In a separate move, the prefectural assembly in western Japan's Shimane Prefecture established a prefectural ordinance this month declaring every February 22 'Takeshima Day' in honor of an island occupied by South Korea but claimed by Japan. South Korea reacted angrily to the ordinance, which the Shimane assembly says is intended to raise awareness of Takeshima, called Tokto in Korean, among the Japanese public.

The area "around the Senkaku Islands" that China has proposed should be a site for joint natural gas field exploration with Japan, includes neither the disputed islands nor Japan's territorial waters around them, government sources said on March 11, 2006. China made proposals for the Senkaku area and another site during the fourth round of talks on the East China Sea gas field issue. One source described China's Senkaku Islands proposal as a ploy, saying: "They knew we'd reject the idea. The proposal was made to stall for time and weaken Japan's effective control of the islands." "China is trying to pressure Taiwan," another source said. The Senkaku Islands, claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan, are called Diaoyu by China and Tiaoyutai by Taiwan. The sources said the other area, "an area around the continental shelf joint development region between Japan and South Korea," is located close to the Asunaro gas field near the Japan-China median line drawn by Japan. The field is called Longjing by China. Although Japan rejected the Chinese proposals, the government hopes for a compromise from China to jointly develop areas previously proposed by Japan, which include four gas fields. According to the sources, the joint development area "around the Senkaku Islands" is directly north of the islands' territorial waters, which extend for 12 nautical miles, or about 22 kilometers. It lies on the Japanese side of the Japan-China median line and is also close to the median line between the islands and Taiwan. The second area may extend in part to the Chinese side of the median line, possibly including the Asunaro field, the sources added. At the talks, the Chinese explanation described it as an area adjacent to the Asunaro field without specifying its location. As for the second area, the government apparently deems it unwise to completely reject the idea, in the belief it might be able to force a compromise that takes into account Japan's proposals. In talks held in the autumn, Japan proposed to China the joint development of four natural gas fields: Asunaro, Kusunoki (Duanqiao in Chinese), Kashi (Tianwaitian) and Shirakaba (Chunxiao). China is already developing these fields, and again rejected Japan's proposal at this week's talks. The four fields straddle the median line and lie between the two areas proposed by China. The Senkaku Islands were initially claimed only by Japan. But after the U.N. Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East reported the possibility of natural resources lying under the seabed in waters around the islands in 1968, China and Taiwan began claiming the islands as their own. The development of natural gas resources in the East China Sea emerged as an issue in June 2004 when Japan learned China was developing the Shirakaba gas field. Since then, Japan and China have held four rounds of bureau chief-level talks and occasional informal negotiations, without reaching any agreements. On Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe said: "We'd like China to make a more realistic proposal. We also want China to examine our proposal thoroughly." On the same day, Foreign Minister Taro Aso said: "The Senkaku Islands are Japanese territory both historically and in the eyes of international law. Japan won't jointly develop the gas fields. Speaking to reporters, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said: "Japan and China have different viewpoints. We'll try to solve the problem through dialogue."

The Japanese Foreign Ministry officially established a Japan-China Economic Office on 1 April, 2006, to serve as a permanent organization assuming special responsibilities for consultations on economic and trade issues with China and for formulating economic strategies towards China. The Japanese government's move is to meet the rapidly changing Japan-China economic relations, further strengthen coordination of economic and trade issues between the two countries, as well as properly handle and solve problems and contradictions arising in the two countries' economic and trade exchanges. As learned, the Japan-China Economic Office was established based on the Economic Group of the China Affairs Section under the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asia and Oceania Bureau. The responsible person is Morio Matsumoto, a regional coordinating officer familiar with Chinese economic affairs. The office will start its initial work with five members and will gradually expand its operations with more personnel later on, to be finally upgraded to a section specializing in handling Japan-China economic issues. Currently there are 30 personnel in the China Affairs Section under the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asia and Oceania Bureau, mainly responsible for handling political issues between Japan and China. As China has maintained a sustained rapid economic growth along with the rapid expansion of Japan-China economic and trade exchanges, economic issues that need to be promptly handled and taken care of have also increased. It is hard for the small number of personnel in the China Affairs Section to coordinate and handle all the economic issues arising between Japan and China. For this reason, the Japanese Foreign Ministry deemed it necessary to establish a permanent organization especially responsible for handling Japan-China economic issues. In the view of Japan's mainstream media, the main purpose of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in establishing the permanent organization specially responsible for handling Japan-China economic issues is to reduce to a minimum the unfavorable impacts on Japan-China economic and trade exchanges brought about by the difficult situations emerging in Japan-China relations in recent years; to prevent Japan's position in China's economy from further declining; to handle possible economic conflicts between the two countries; and to reinforce Japan's protection of its intellectual property rights. Some individual Japanese leaders have, in recent years, kept visiting and worshipping the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Class-A war criminals. This has seriously damaged the feelings of the Chinese people and the people of other victimized countries, landing Japan-China relations in a difficult situation. Despite a continuous growth in Japan-China trade in recent years, the Japanese government feels that the difficult situation in Japan-China relations has affected the two countries' economic and trade exchanges. The Japanese Foreign Ministry expects that by establishing an organization to specially handle Japan-China economic issues, it will be able to separately handle economic and political issues so as to reduce to a minimum the unfavorable impacts of the difficult situation in Japan-China relations on the economy. Another important reason for Japan to establish the Japan-China Economic Office is to prevent Japan's position in China's economy from further declining. Japan remained China's biggest trade partner for many years in the past. But two years ago, Japan's position in China's economy began to decline, dropping to third place on China's major trade partner list. The Japanese government believes that further strengthening Japan-China economic and trade cooperation will benefit Japan's economic development. Moreover, with the in-depth development of Japan-China economic and trade exchanges, there will be more economic and trade frictions between the two countries, with possible occurrences of all kinds of economic and trade frictions and unexpected economic disputes. Promptly and properly handling economic and trade disputes between the two countries will be conducive to the stable development of the two countries' economic and trade cooperation.

The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe concluded his official visit to China on the morning of 9 October, 2006, and left Beijing by special plane for a visit to the ROK [Republic of Korea]. During his China visit, China and Japan issued a joint communique expressing agreement on properly handling the problems that affect the development of the two countries' relations, but Abe did not make a open commitment on the issue of paying homage at the Yasukuni Shrine. Experts believe that Abe's current visit has provided an opportunity for change in China-Japan relations and laid a basis for further discussing and resolving problems. But it will take long for both sides to substantially resolve their problems. Abe visited China for the first time since he became prime minister. Wang Shaopu, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific Studies Institute under the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, is of the opinion that Abe's selection of Beijing as the first destination of his visit signifies his good intention to improve the two countries' relations. One of the prerequisites for China and Japan to reach a consensus on Abe's China visit was overcoming the political obstacles to China-Japan relations. It is under such a condition that China-Japan relations have presented an opportunity for change. However, in seizing this opportunity for an actual improvement in China-Japan relations, both sides need to make efforts to conscientiously overcome the specific political obstacles to China-Japan relations. Otherwise, the opportunity is unlikely not to be missed. Prior to his China visit, China and Japan further exchanged their views on overcoming the political obstacles, and Abe also made certain commitments, but the problem is how he will fulfill them. Although Abe did not explicitly express his attitude on the Yasukuni Shrine issue, he said at a news briefing on the night of 8 October that he had conducted an in-depth self-examination on the disasters and pains Japan caused to the Asian people in the past and that Japan would stick to a peaceful development direction in the future. Politics and economy are like the two wheels of a car in Japan-China relations, he said, adding that only by pushing forward the two wheels of Japan-China political and economic relations, will it be possible to promote the two countries' relations onto a higher stage. Japan affairs expert Liu Jiangyong of the International Issues Research Institute under Qinghua University said that viewing from the present situation, Japan has properly secured the direction of its relations with China. Namely, viewing from the angle of reality, Japan has fully understood the tremendous harm on Japan's political and economic sectors if Japan and China do not engage in exchanges. Whereas China has also adopted a positive attitude on China-Japan relations since Abe assumed office. This also fully suggests China's intention to improve China-Japan relations. If dialogue between the two countries' heads of state can maintain a "sustained development," it will create a better environment for China-Japan economic and trade relations. This will help gradually transform the situation of politics being cold and economy being hot into political and economic reciprocity between the two countries. Lam Kai-ngan, Hong Kong's Japan affairs expert and professor of the Baptist University's History Department, pointed out to our reporter that the symbolic significance of Abe's meetings with Chinese leaders is stronger than the substantial achievements in his visit, but this suggests that China and Japan have already started to pragmatically handle their relations. In his opinion, with regard to resolving specific problems between China and Japan, both sides need to continue their consultations through the dialogue mechanism. There are some problems in mutual trust between China and Japan. This has been caused by historical factors. Both sides are taking precautions against each other. It will take long to make an adjustment and adaptation. But China-Japan cooperation benefits both sides, and this has been recognized by both sides. Some analyses point out that Abe's China visit is an "ice-breaking tour" that has made China-Japan relations return to normal, but there are still "reefs" in the future voyage of China-Japan relations. Hu Jintao and Abe met today, but there is not much to speak of the substantial results. This was something to be expected, because both sides only sought for expression of friendly attitude. On how fast the relations will improve, this requires Japan to show its sincerity. However, there is already an opportunity for China and Japan to break the stalemate. As long as both sides clear up the "fuzzy" tactics, respect each other, alleviate their conflicts, and adopt former CCP leader Deng Xiaoping's principle of "keeping aside sovereignty for joint exploitation" on sticky issues like the East Sea oil field development and the Diaoyu Islands, they will be able to create a reciprocal win-win situation.

Discussion:
MID2208 is called `Dagu (Taku) Harbor' and occurred March 15-18, 1926. This is a multilateral mid involving Germany, China, Japan, France, the UK, the US, the USSR and Italy. In this incident, the Great Powers demanded that China de-mine the Dagu Harbor as it provided access to a major river into China. The Great Powers jointly threatened military action if China did not acquiesce. China and Japan engaged in naval hostilities in which several seamen were killed on both sides during this period.

Discussion:
MID3208 occurred from 12/14/1953 to 7/4/1954. The issue in this period was one of access to fishing waters. The Japanese pursued access to fishing areas adjacent to China. The Japanese came within ten miles of the Chinese coast. In an effort to brush the Japanese back, the PRC seized and fired on a number of Japanese fishing boats during this period. Three specific incidents are described below. On 12/15/1953, a fleet of PRC gunboats fired on four Japanese ships Southwest of Korea and seized one Japanese trawler. On 3/14/1954, a PRC patrol boat fired on a Japanese fishing boat that was fishing ten miles off the coast of Chekiang. On 7/4/1954, the PRC seized four Japanese fishing boats of the coast of Shanghai.

Discussion:
MID2853 occurred on 5/7/1958. The PRC seized fourteen Japanese fishing boats with 170 fishermen aboard. The PRC claimed that these boats were encroaching on PRC fishing waters. The New York Times reported that the issue at hand was disagreement over the details of a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries. An issue noted was whether the PRC could fly the Red Chinese flag over its trade mission office in Tokyo.
