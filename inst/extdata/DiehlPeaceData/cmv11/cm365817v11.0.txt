TERRLINK: MID611 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID611 from cm002365 narrative, this is the Vietnam War. Soviet Union supported North Vietnam against South Vietnam. South Korea fought alongside the South Vietnamese. The Vietnam War was both a territorial MID and a civil war MID. The territorial element comes from the fact each side claimed the entirety of the other's territory. This is coded as a third party link to territorial MID because Soviet Union was involved in the North-South dispute by fighting with opposite sides.

MARITMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID611 involved the disputation of maritime territory as well, but coded not maritime here because Soviet Union is not a claimant to the maritime territory. 

ISLMID: MID611 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID611 involved the disputation of islands off the coast of South Vietnam as well, but coded not maritime here because Soviet Union is not a claimant to the island territory.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID611 the Vietnam War was also civil war in nature, as guerillas were fighting in the North and the South. Coded civil war MID because South Vietnam is within this dyad, and there were communist guerillas fighting in South Vietnam. 

CIVWARLINK: MID611 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
