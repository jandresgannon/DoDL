MID2606 

TERRMID: MID2606 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID2606 1 -- certain

CIVWARMID: MID2606 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID2606 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2606, MID197, and MID2366 all occurred in connection with US and its allies' interventions into the Russian Revolution. The rivalry between the US and the USSR began with US intervention in the Russian Revolution. The US sent troops into several Russian cities on several occasions, sparking clashes with Russian troops and several MIDs between 1918 and 1920. The Allied powers were attempting to help the anti-Bolshevik forces in Russia prevent the Bolsheviks from taking power, and Canada was involved as part of the Allied Powers here. Coded civil war MID because the Russian revolution caused the US and allies, including Canada, to intervene militarily in order to influence the outcome of the civil war.

CIVWARLINK: MID2606 3 -- not civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID2606 1 -- certain

MARITMID-CER: MID2226 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID2226 from cm narrative, this involves a show of ships, or a mutual display of naval power, between USSR and several NATO countries, including Canada.
