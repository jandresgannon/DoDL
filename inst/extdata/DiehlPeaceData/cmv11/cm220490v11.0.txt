CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3975 from NYT 10/30/1991, widespread domestic unrest was occurring in Zaire after the economy crashed. Belgium and France sent soldiers in to evacuate their nationals, and remained in the country even as President Mobutu demanded they leave, triggering this MID. Coded not civil war because the NYT (10/30/1991 and 11/4/1991) does not indicate that rebel groups were among the domestic protests. Some soldiers were looting/extracting bribes from locals, but there is no mention of rebels.
