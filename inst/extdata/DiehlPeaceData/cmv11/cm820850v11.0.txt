The UN commission of inquiry, which was headed by Laurence Michelmore of the United States, arrived in the territories on August 16, 1963. On September 14, 1963, the UN commission of inquiry reported that the election results, which had indicated support for the federation in North Borneo, were consistent with the opinions of a majority of individuals in the territories. Indonesia rejected the results of the UN commission of inquiry on September 15, 1963. The *Federation of Malaysia* was formally established on September 16, 1963. On September 17, 1963, Malaysia severed diplomatic relations with Indonesia after Indonesia continued its opposition to the federation.

NARRATIVE-CR:
There are three issues in the rivalry between Indonesia and Malaysia: a territorial dispute, a diversion away from domestic issues,and a reaction to British presence and decolonization in the region. Self proclaimed president for life Sukarno of Indonesia wanted to include the British colonies of Sabah (British North Borneo),Sarawak along with Brunei into a "Greater" Indonesia. Prior to the disputes between Indonesia and Malaysia, Indonesia struggled to establish cohesion. Sukarno had difficulty uniting the far flung archipelago. Sukarno saw the British proposition as an opportunity to divert domestic attention from chronic boughts of social unrest that plagued Indonesia and unify his country against a common external enemy. The second issue related to the initiation of hostilities is Sukarno's opposition to colonial influence in the region. In the early 1960s, the British announced plans to divest itself of the colonial possesions of Sabah (British North Borneo), Sarawak, and merge these territories with Singapore, Brunei and Malaya to form the new state of Malaysia. Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei share the island Borneo with the Indonesian province Kalimantan. Indonesian President Sukarno, was a strong nationalist staunchly oppossed to European imperialism in Southeast Asia. He thought the British would continue to have undue influence in the region and saw British plans to provide for the defence of Malaysia and their continued close relationship with Malaysia, as proxy colonialism. Beginning in February of 1963 small Indonesian commando units infiltrated the border with Sarawak and Sabah. These units also attacked Singapore and made small incursions into the Malayan peninsula itself (MID2913). There were also attacks on civilian Malayan fishing vessels in the South China Sea (MID2904). These disputes were a part of Presidnet Sukarno's policy of "confrontation" with the newly formed Malaysia. The British were concerned with the communist presence in Indonesian and committed to providing for the defense of their former colinal possessions. Therefore, Commonwealth forces from Australia and the United Kingdom provided for the defence of Sarawak and Sabah from the cross border guerilla attacks by the Indonesians that lasted from February 1963 until September of 1965 (MID1070).

In the summer of 1965 the government of Singapore withdrew from the Malaysin federation. This would have worked well with Sukarno's plans to destabalize the newly formed Malaysia, however at around the same time (September 30, 1965), a group of leftist junior military officers attempted a coup d' etat. They kinnapped and killed six high ranking generals in the Sukarno regime. Ultimately, the coup was not successful and a military group headed by General Suharto suppressed the attempted empted siezure of power. The military, especially General Suharto, subsequently gained increased influence in the country. In the aftermath of the attepted coup the military and right-wing Muslim groups retaliated against \ the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in what came to be know as the Indonesian Blood Bath.

In March of 1966 amid continued unrest throught the country, Presient Sukarno was forced to transfer emergency executive powers to Gen. Suharto. From this point on Indonesia's confrontation with Malaysia came to a standstill. On August 11 1966 the policy of Confrontgation with Malaysia was formally discontinued. Relations between the states improved in the aftermath of what some have referred to as the Borneo War. In August of 1967, Indonesia and Malaysia joined the Phillipines, Singapore, and Thailand in establishing the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). In 1968 joint Malaysian-Indonesian security operations took place against the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party). There have been no disputes between the states since the last dispute took place in 1965.

The three MIDs are all related however, the first (MID1070)captures the Borneo War in general and the two MIDs that take place subsequently (MID2904 and MID2913) are a part of the conflict ongoing betweent Malaysia and Indonesia.
