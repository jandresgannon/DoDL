CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to fight with the rebels against the government. From Washington Post 4/11/1977 and 5/15/1977, Egypt provided arms and troops to fight in the civil war in Zaire. Egypt was one of the countries fighting to keep the Zaire government in power. Cuba and Egypt's opposing support in the Zaire civil war pulls them into this MID against each other. Coded civil war link because this is connected to the Zaire civil war, outside of this dyad.
