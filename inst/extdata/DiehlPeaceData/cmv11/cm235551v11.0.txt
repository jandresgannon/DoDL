CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1392 from Gibler (2018), Zambia was allowing rebels from Mozambique and Angola to use its territory for safe haven. Rebels regularly crossed the border to attack Portugal-controlled Mozambique and Angola. Here, Portuguese soldiers repeatedly crossed into Zambia, and Zambia seized two soldiers. Coded civil war MID because Portugal is facing civil conflict within its controlled territory (i.e., in this dyadâ€™s members), and their pursuing rebels across the border into Zambia contributes to this MID.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1391 from Gibler (2018), Portugal accused Zambia of sheltering rebels, and seized five Zambians in retaliation. Zambia had been providing safe have for rebels targeting Portugal inside Angola and Mozambique, both of which were Portuguese colonial possessions at this time. Coded civil war MID because this dispute was connected to rebels in Zambia who regularly targeted Portugal.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1390 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1390 from Gibler (2018), this is another dispute involving Portugal attacking rebels in Zambia. Portuguese soldiers arrested two Zambian border guards, and afterward, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) killed two guerrillas who were working with Portuguese forces. Zambia and Portugal had experienced conflict in the recent past due to Zambia providing safe haven for rebels who were attempting to drive Portugal out of Angola and Mozambique, both of which were colonial possessions of Portugal at this time. Coded civil war MID because this is connected to rebel groups in Zambia who were regularly attacking Portuguese targets.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Zambia became independent from United Kingdom on October 24, 1964. The rivalry between Portugal and Zambia was based upon the Zambian government's hosting of rebel groups with the aims of liberating both Mozambique and Angola from Portuguese colonial control. For the period February 19, 1966-July 18, 1969, statistics reveal a total of 31 Portuguese violations of Zambian territory from Angola and 34 violations from Mozambique. Portugal forces killed 243 rebels in Angola from the group the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola on December 25, 1966 in response to attacks that they claimed had been staged recently from neighboring Zambia. This began MID1392. Zambia has since 1967 sought by direct and indirect means to facilitate negotiations between the Portuguese authorities and African freedom fighters. President Kaunda of Zambia accused Portugal of aerial bombing of the town of Chipata in Zambia on December 2, 1968. In spring 1969 the Lusaka Manifesto was adopted by fourteen east and central African states and endorsed by the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations General Assembly, supporting the liberation movements through peaceful means of Angola and Mozambique against Portugal. Zambian officials arrested two Portuguese soldiers near the Portuguese Angola-Zambian border in June 1969. President Kaunda again accused Portugal of bombing the Zambian town of Lote on June 30, 1969. On August 7, 1969, Portugal warned Zambia not to assist rebels in Angola. President Banda of Malawi mediated negotiations between Portugal and Zambia. Zambia released the two Portuguese soldiers on September 20, 1969. On March 5, 1971, Portugal accused rebels from Mozambique that were based in Zambia of kidnapping 11 civilians. This occurred after Portugal closed all ports in Mozambique to Zambian trade between February and June 1971. This was MID1391. Throughout 1972 and into 1973, rebel groups based out of Zambia staged attacks against Portuguese forces in both Angola and Mozambique. Other conflicts in the first half of 1973 that involved the two countries appeared to revolve around terrorist activities in Rhodesia that were done by groups based in Zambia, but coming through Portuguese Mozambique. These were not direct conflicts between the two countries, but involved both of them in some respects. This is MID1390. On June 5-6, 1974, Zambia played a third party role in the negotiations between Portugal and Mozambique's liberation movements. Mozambique was liberated from Portuguese colonial control on June 25, 1975. Angola was liberated from Portuguese control on November 11, 1975. These exits by Portugal marked an end to the rivalry between Portugal and Zambia, as the basis for the rivalry had been staged attacks against Portuguese colonial forces in those two countries.

From its independence on October 24, 1964, Zambia supported the activities of various liberation movements of its neighbors, Angola and Mozambique. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) was recognized as representing the Angolan people in 1965. They had their regional offices in Lusaka, Zambia's capital, from 1965 to 1968 and from 1968 to 1974 had their headquarters there. In Mozambique, the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) was recognized by Zambia as representing the Mozambiquan people in 1965 and they had a regional office in Lusaka from 1964 to 1975. Until the independence of Angola and Mozambique, the Zambian government offered its good offices support to the Angolan and Mozambiquan liberation movements in an attempt to bring the various splinter groups together in unified organizations so that they could fight the Portuguese better. In 1965 Zambia was a co-sponsor of a United Nations General Assembly Resolution condemning Portuguese colonial ambitions in Angola and Mozambique and their refusal to allow these countries to become independent. However, in the same time, Zambia was courting Portugal because as a land-locked country it needed an exit to the sea, either through Portugal's Angola or through Mozambique, considering that its relations with South Africa or UK's Rhodesia were extremely negative. In December 1965 Portugal threatened to close the ports of Beira and Lobito to Zambian goods if Lusaka did not hand over the FRELIMO rebels who had allegedly killed two Portuguese in a raid on Mozambique. For the period February 19, 1966-July 18, 1969, statistics reveal a total of 31 Portuguese violations of Zambian territory from Angola and 34 violations from Mozambique. The first MID of RIV643, MID1392 started on December 25,1966.

The last MID of RIV643, MID1390, ended on June 14, 1973. In 1975, following the Portuguese granting of independence to Angola (June 25, 1975) and Mozambique (November 11, 1975), Zambia established diplomatic relations with Portugal. In December 1981, Zambia and Portugal in a joint communique called for speedy implementation of the United Nations resolution 435 to solve the Namibian problem and expressed a desire for the western contact group to help achieve Namibia's independence. The joint communique, issued at the conclusion of a three-day visit to Zambia by Portuguese president Antonio Romalho Eanes, condemned the continued aggression by South Africa against Namibia and neighboring independent states. The communique also expressed a desire to promote the two countries' cooperation in agriculture, education and tourism. On September 26, 1986, Zambia ordered a Portuguese aircraft carrying 121 passengers and eight crew to land in Lusaka and held it on the ground for 18 hours, claiming it had violated Zambian airspace. It was released after the Portuguese Ambassador in Lusaka appealed to the Zambian Foreign Minister. None of the passengers or crew had been harmed. Zambia claimed that Portugal's state airline, Tap-Air Portugal, had failed to request permission to fly over the country. The Zambian Government declared its airspace a restricted area after a South African attack on the country several months ago. Political observers in Lisbon believe the action was taken in retaliation for Portugal's role in preventing the export of coal being included in EEC sanctions against South Africa. In March 1989, Portugal has pledged $50 million toward the rehabilitation of the strategic east-west Benguela railway that before Angola's independence provided a vital route for exports from nearby Zaire and Zambia to the Atlantic. This was great news for the landlocked Zambia. In June 1989, at a meeting between neighbors of South Africa and the European Communities member-states, the Zambian Foreign Minister Luke Mwanashiku was disappointed in Portugal's approach towards South Africa, which was the common denominator for most of the European states present. Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro said that at the meeting, Portugal had reaffirmed its opposition to the policy of sanctions and had stressed the importance of ''taking advantage of the change of leadership in Pretoria'' in order to intensify dialogue. Zambia and other African states wanted European sanctions imposed on the apartheid regime of South Africa. In the early 1990s, due to financial constraints Zambia closed its embassy to Lisbon. In February 1997, Portugal announced that it wants to enhance trade link with Zambia, according to sources from the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI). ZACCI is to sign a trade agreement with the newly launched Portuguese-Zambian commercial and industrial association (PZCIA). PZCIA was formed in January 1997 to help enhance trade between Portugal and Zambia, which has not been so impressive in the past. PZCIA head Herculano Anjos was in Lusaka for discussions with Zambian businessmen. He said PZCIA will help link up the two countries' businessmen so as to help boost their two-way trade. For this purpose, a delegation of Portuguese entrepreneurs visited Zambia in 1997. Anjos said Zambia is rich in natural resources but has remained closed to Portugal which, if given necessary information, will see many businessmen and potential investors coming into the southern African country. He said PZCIA will act as a liaison office between the two nations by giving appropriate information on products available in either country. "We would like to bring in new lines of trade in Zambia in which we can also exchange some of Zambia's natural resources for technology and equipment," Anjos added. Neither Portugal, nor Zambia, currently have diplomatic missions in Lusaka, respectively, Lisbon. Their diplomatic affairs are regulated through their embassies in neighboring countries.
