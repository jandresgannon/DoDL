CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1441 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1441 from NYT 1/16/1976 and 3/23/1976, both Cuba and Zaire (among others) were intervening or providing support in the Angolan Civil War. Cuba and Zaire were supporting opposing factions, bringing them into this MID against each other. (Zaire was supporting a nationalist faction who was fighting for the government, so Zaire was essentially supporting the government in the civil war.) Both countries were providing arms and economic support to their respective factions. Coded civil war link because this MID was triggered by opposing support in the Angolan Civil War, outside of this dyad.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID2150 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to fight with the rebels against the government, and Zaire suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba for doing so in April 1977. The Cuban support and the subsequent severing of diplomatic relations brings Cuba and Zaire into this MID against each other here. Coded civil war MID because this MID occurs due to Cuba intervening in the civil war in Zaire, within this dyad.
