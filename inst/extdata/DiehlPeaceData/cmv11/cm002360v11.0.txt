NARRATIVE-CR:

The rivalry between the US and Romania is one that is a product of conflicting alliances. The first two MIDs are the cover their opposing involvement in World War II. The last MID is the Yugoslav-Soviet rift. There do not seem to be significant direct issues between the two countries. Though they are opposed in WWII Romania is a secondary actor and allies with Hitler more out of fear and pragmatism than from a sense of political or ideological affinity. In the Yugoslav-Soviet rift, Romania is again a minor actor as is the US. Thus the rivalry does not have the characteristics of a direct hostile relationship as is indicated by the number of MIDs between them. 

MID258 and MID3711 are World War II and cover Romania's involvement in the war. Romania fought on the side of the axis powers from June of 1941 until August of 1944. On April 13, 1939, France and Britain pledged to ensure the independence of Romania, but negotiations on a similar Soviet guarantee collapsed when Romania refused to allow the Red Army to cross its frontiers. On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a nonaggression pact containing a secret protocol giving the Soviet Union the Balkans as its sphere of influence. Freed of any Soviet threat, Germany invaded Poland on September 1 and ignited World War II. The Nazi-Soviet pact and Germany's three-week blitzkrieg against Poland panicked Romania, which granted refuge to members of Poland's fleeing government. Romania's premier, Armand Calinescu, proclaimed neutrality, but Iron Guards assassinated him on September 21. King Carol tried to maintain neutrality for several months more, but France's surrender and Britain's retreat from Europe rendered meaningless their assurances to Romania, and therefore Carol needed to strike a deal with Hitler. 

The Red Army occupied Bucharest on August 31, 1944. In Moscow on September 12, Romania and the Soviet Union signed an armistice on terms Moscow virtually dictated. Romania agreed to pay reparations, repeal anti-Jewish laws, ban fascist groups, and retrocede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. Representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain established an Allied Control Commission in Bucharest, but the Soviet military command exercised predominant authority. By the time hostilities between Romania and the Soviet Union ended, Romania's military losses had totaled about 110,000 killed and 180,000 missing or captured; the Red Army also transported about 130,000 Romanian soldiers to the Soviet Union, where many perished in prison camps. After its surrender, Romania committed about fifteen divisions to the Allied cause under Soviet command. Before the end of hostilities against Germany, about 120,000 Romanian troops perished helping the Red Army liberate Czechoslovakia and Hungary. 

MID1286 occurred from August of 1949 through November of 1951. This MID is titled `Yugoslavia vs. Cominform countries.' It is covers the rift in relations between the USSR and Yugoslavia. It pits Yugoslavia and the US v. the USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The central combatants here were the USSR and Yugoslavia. This event is also described as the Yugoslav-Soviet Rift. In this MID Stalin feared that he was losing his grip on Eastern Europe and in 1947 ordered creation of a Soviet-dominated socialist bloc. In 1947, the Soviet, East European, Italian, and French communist parties founded the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau). Stalin saw the independent Communists in Yugoslavia as a direct threat. There were other precursors to antagonism including Stalin's wartime objections to Yugoslavian Communist political initiative, his refusal to provide aid to the Communist movement in Yugoslavia, and Red Army looting and raping in Yugoslavia in 1944 and 1945. There were also issues regarding Yugoslavia resistance to participation in Soviet economic schemes that would have had a one way beneficiary relationship towards Moscow. After a series of escalatory steps the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia and called on Yugoslav communists to overthrow Tito. At first the Yugoslav communists and Tito responded in a conciliatory fashion. Yugoslavs supported Soviet foreign policy and implemented Stalinist economic measures. However, collectivization proved disastrous as agricultural output decreased and coercive tactics used by the regime eroded support for the government. Yugoslav relations with the West in 1949 were also in a poor state as there were lingering issues with Italy over Trieste and issues with various countries over nationalized property within Yugoslavia. The Soviet-bloc governments launched an economic blockade against Yugoslavia, excluding it from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA). The Soviets propagandized harshly against "Judas" Tito in Serbo-Croatian broadcasts, attempted to subvert Yugoslav party organizations, and sought to incite unrest among the Hungarian, Albanian, and Russian minorities in Yugoslavia. Troop movements and border incidents convinced Yugoslav leaders that a Soviet-bloc invasion was imminent, requiring fundamental changes in foreign policy. In July 1949, Tito closed the Yugoslav-Greek border and ceased supplying the pro-Cominform Greek communists, and in August Yugoslav votes in the United Nations began to stray from the Soviet line. Welcoming the Yugoslav-Soviet rift, the West commenced a flow of economic aid in 1949, saved the country from hunger in 1950, and covered much of Yugoslavia's trade deficit for the next decade. The United States began shipping weapons to Yugoslavia in 1951. A military security arrangement was concluded in 1953, but the Western powers were unable to bring Yugoslavia into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). During the MID there were minor skirmishes on the border and a US cargo aircraft carrying supplies to Yugoslavia was forced to land in Hungary but subsequently allowed to proceed. 

Romania took significant steps to break away from Soviet control in the early 1960s which helped to produce a thaw in US-Romanian relations and the initiation of limited scale contact between the two countries. At the beginning of the Johnson administration it openly sought U.S. economic assistance, carried through a series of changes designed to meet U.S. linkage requirements, and openly declared its independence from Soviet foreign policy leadership. In addition to improved trade relations, Romania sought loans, technology, and foreign investment. It also tried to play a useful role as an intermediary in setting up peace talks between the United States and North Vietnam. The improved nature of U.S.-Romanian relations was symbolized by the visit of Prime Minister Maurer to the United States. 

With the United States' increased involvement in the Vietnam War, relations deteriorated. In the late 1960s, following Romanian condemnation of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the opening of the Paris peace talks, political relations between the two states improved significantly, but economic relations remained minimal because of United States restrictions on trade with Eastern Europe. 

Evidence of improved relations between the nations was President Nixon's visit to Romania in August 1969-the first visit by an American head of state to a communist country since the 1945 Yalta Conference. Nixon received an enthusiastic welcome, and a wide range of international problems were discussed. The countries agreed upon the mutual establishment of libraries, the opening of negotiations for the conclusion of a consular convention, and the development and diversification of economic ties. Ceausescu visited the United States in October 1970 to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the UN General Assembly. 

Nixon moved to strengthen economic relations with Romania, and in 1972 the United States Congress debated granting most-favored-nation status. In 1975 a three-year agreement made Romania the first East European country to receive the special trade status, and in 1981 bilateral trade reached US$1 billion. But because of persistent reports of human rights violations in Romania, and the regime's decision to impose an education tax on applicants for exit visas, the United States Congress hesitated to renew most-favored-nation status.

PS-NARRATIVE:

19440823-19511124 Transition

On August 23, 1944, Romania changed sides in World War II and became an ally of Soviet Union and United States against Germany. However, under the 1947 Treaty of Paris, the Allies refused co-belligerent status to Romania. Rudolf Schoenfeld was appointed as a diplomatic representative to Romania, on Jul 28, 1947. Previously, U.S. and Romania broke off diplomatic relations on December 12, 1941. The last MID between U.S. and Romania was over the issue of Yugoslavia and it ended on 19511124.The relations, even though without the possibility of escalating to violent militarized conflict, became negative as Romania joined the group of Communist countries in 1947, under Soviet occupation. 

19511125-19891222 0.25

The last MID between U.S. and Romania, MID1286 ended on 19511124. During the 1950s the relations were cold, but after the Hungarian Uprising in 1956, the Romanian leader, Gheorghe-Gheorghiu Dej wanted to improve the relations with Washington and establish direct trade. This was contingent on a solution for the nationalized properties that belonged to Americans before World War II. In March 1960, Romania and U.S. signed an agreement settling their mutual financial claims resulting from nationalization of Americans' property by the postwar communist regime. In December 1960 Romania and U.S. signed a cultural agreement, the second of its kind with a Communist state for U.S. Romania took significant steps to break away from Soviet control in the early 1960s which helped to produce a thaw in US-Romanian relations and the initiation of limited scale contact between the two countries. At the beginning of the Johnson administration it openly sought U.S. economic assistance, carried through a series of changes designed to meet U.S. linkage requirements, and openly declared its independence from Soviet foreign policy leadership. In addition to improved trade relations, Romania sought loans, technology, and foreign investment. It also tried to play a useful role as an intermediary in setting up peace talks between the United States and North Vietnam, being a channel between Washington and Hanoi in 1965-1967. The improved nature of U.S.-Romanian relations was symbolized by the visit of Prime Minister Maurer to the United States. 

With the United States' increased involvement in the Vietnam War, relations deteriorated. In the late 1960s, following Romanian condemnation of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the opening of the Paris peace talks, political relations between the two states improved significantly, but economic relations remained minimal because of United States restrictions on trade with Eastern Europe. Romania has been one of the strongest critics from of the Warsaw Pact from within, refusing on a regular basis any raises in arms expenditures suggested by Soviet Union. Alone of the Warsaw Pact nations, Romania did not sever diplomatic ties with Israel in 1967, which was definitely a plus in the relations with United States. Throughout the Soviet-Chinese dispute, Romania maintained good relations with China. In addition, Romania eased restrictions on emigration.

Evidence of improved relations between the nations was President Nixon's visit to Romania on August 3, 1969-the first visit by an American head of state to a communist country since the 1945 Yalta Conference. Nixon received an enthusiastic welcome, and a wide range of international problems were discussed. The countries agreed upon the mutual establishment of libraries, the opening of negotiations for the conclusion of a consular convention, and the development and diversification of economic ties. Ceausescu visited the United States in October 1970 to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary session of the UN General Assembly. 
Nixon moved to strengthen economic relations with Romania, and in 1972 the United States Congress debated granting most-favored-nation status. In 1975 U.S. President Gerald Ford visited Romania. In 1975 a three-year agreement made Romania the first East European country to receive the special trade status, and in 1981 bilateral trade reached US$1 billion. But because of persistent reports of human rights violations in Romania, and the regime's decision to impose an education tax on applicants for exit visas, the United States Congress hesitated to renew most-favored-nation status. President Ceausescu of Romania refused in 1988 any renewal of the most-favored-nation status. Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu was Carter's guest in Washington in 1978.

In December 1985, Secretary of State George Schultz visited Bucharest and warned that Romania could lose most-favored-nation status unless it changed its human rights policies. Both sides agreed to establish a system of consultation on human rights issues. Trade between the United States and Rumania rose from $738.4 million in 1983 to a record $1.2 billion in 1984. There is a large surplus in Rumania's favor, with Rumanian exports last year amounting to $974 million, mostly in petroleum products. Rumania also values having the beneficial tariff status for political reasons, since it underscores its relative independence in the Soviet bloc. State Department officials said Mr. Shultz would emphasize continued American appreciation for Rumania's foreign policy while underscoring concerns about human rights. Romania did not abide by the agreement, however, and at the beginning of 1987 it was removed from the list of countries allowed to export certain goods-mainly raw materials-duty-free to the United States. The United States Congress voted to suspend most favored-nation status for six months because of Romanian limitations of religious freedom, restrictions on emigration, and persecution of its Hungarian minority. The Reagan administration, however, succeeded in getting congressional approval for its recommendation to renew the status, hoping the action would encourage Romania to improve its human rights record. 

In February 1988, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead visited Bucharest and restated United States disapproval of Romania's human rights policies. Ceausescu, in turn, accused the United States of meddling in Romanian internal affairs. Later the same month, the United States State Department announced that Romania had relinquished its most-favored-nation trade status. 

The deterioration in relations continued, and in March 1989 the United States Department of State called off plans for a meeting with high-ranking Romanian officials, warning that a further crackdown against critics of the regime would have negative consequences for bilateral relations. 

19891223-19920311 Transition

On December 23, 1989, Romania gave up Communism in the only bloody revolution in Eastern Europe in that year. In 1990, the United States has sent about $750,000 in emergency aid to Romania, most of it medical supplies. Secretary of State James A. Baker made an unscheduled stop in Romania, in February 1990, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Romania since the 1989 December revolution. In 1991, the Romanian Prime Minister, Petre Roman made an unofficial visit to Washington D.C. during which he met with Secretary of State Baker. This was a sign of the thawing relations, which remained cold after the 1989 overthrow of Communism in Romania, mainly because of Washington's criticisms of the Romanian new administration's undemocratic ways for ruling the country.

The U.S. administration announced on March 11, 1992 that it is prepared to sign a new bilateral trade agreement with Romania that would include the coveted most-favored-nation tariff treatment. On November 2, 1993, President Clinton signed into law P.L. 103-133, approving the extension of Most-Favored Nation (MFN) treatment to the products of Romania under the United States-Romania Trade Agreement. On May 19, 1995, the President found Romania to be in full compliance with the requirements contained in the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Romania is also a member of the World Trade Organization. After the extension of MFN treatment to the products of Romania, two-way trade between the United States and Romania rose from $ 376 million in 1993 to $ 528 million in 1994. On August 3, 1996, President Clinton signed into law legislation permanently normalizing trade relations between the United States and Romania. "This is an important milestone in U.S.-Romanian relations," the president said in a statement. "Romania now joins other emerging democracies in Central Europe from which the United States has fully removed trade restrictions that originated in concerns about emigration practices during the Cold War." "My approval of this bill reflects the strong U.S. support for the citizens of Romania in their efforts to overcome the legacy of decades of communist repression, and to establish a full democracy based on respect for human rights, the rule of law, tolerance and free market economics," he said.

In 1997 Romania and the U.S. got closer over the issue of NATO membership. Even though Romania was not officially invited to become a member of NATO that year, the high-level visits from American officials as well as the changes Romania made on the path to democracy and military structures were seen positively by Washington. U.S. did not support Romania's early membership in 1997, but the trend was set for future cooperation, promising Romania NATO membership sometime in the future. 

On June 19, 1997, U.S. Vice President Al Gore met with Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea of Romania to discuss plans for developing the long-term partnership between the United States and Romania. They agreed that this partnership is a natural product of the long-term objectives both countries share in Central and Southeast Europe: the achievement of democracy, security, stability and increasing prosperity based on market economic reform. The Vice President noted that a strong and developing U.S-Romanian partnership has become possible in great measure due to Romania's extraordinary recent achievements, including the acceleration of economic reform, Romania's historic outreach to the ethnic-Hungarian community, her breakthroughs in relations with neighbors Hungary and Ukraine, and her contribution to European security through IFOR/SFOR in Bosnia and the Multilateral Protection Force in Albania.

In July 1997, President Clinton of United States visited Romania, the first presidential visit of a U.S. president after the fall of Communism. President Clinton emphasized that even though Romania was not invited as a member at NATO's 1997 Madrid summit, if it keeps up its reforms it will certainly be invited in the next wave of NATO enlargement. The United States and Romania signed a counter-proliferation agreement to help curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction in March 1998. The accord, which will require Romania to tighten its border security, was signed at the Pentagon by the Romanian Defense Minister Constantin Dudu Ionescu and the U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen. On November 30, 1999, Romanian President Constantinescu and U.S.Secretary of Defense, William Cohen held a meeting. This was the occasion to review, not only the military relations but also the generally good ties between Romania and the United States, ties that have a central place in Romania's political strategy and help the stability in the area. The US guest conveyed United States' thanks for Romania's backup during the Kosovo conflict, as well as, for the latter's very important contribution to the SFOR mission in Bosnia. William Cohen also expressed the US support for the Romanian Army's reform, in view of the latter's joining NATO.

The United States has become the second major investor in Romania with U.S. investments increasing by 50 percent last year over the previous years combined, a U.S. official said in February 2000. From 1993 to 1999 the U.S. invested some $586 million in Romania, placing the country second greatest investor after France which invested $719 million. Romania's Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu said, on May,22nd, 2000, while on visit to Washington, that his meetings with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was extremely good and at the same time "we approached very tangible issues". "This meeting strengthened my confidence that there is not only the potential for the fast and further development of the relations between Romania and the United States of America, but also the mutual interest in it," Isarescu stated. "Above all, we talked about the strategic partnership with the United States, and the secretary of state stressed once more, the support the United States gives to Romania's joining NATO, the European communities, and the Euro-Atlantic structures, at large," he pointed out. July 11, 2000 marked the third anniversary of the Strategic Partnership between the United States and Romania, launched during President Clinton's visit to Bucharest in 1997. The Partnership established the framework for strengthening bilateral cooperation in the areas of regional and Euro-Atlantic security, military reform, economic cooperation, and law enforcement.

Through the Partnership, the United States and Romania have steadily developed closer relations, based on their shared values of freedom, democracy, a market economy and respect for human rights. In January 2000, Secretary Albright and Romanian Foreign Minister Petre Roman agreed on an Intensified Strategic Partnership Framework. On April 18, 2000, Under Secretary Larson hosted the first Economic Dialogue under the new arrangement. The United States appreciates Romania's support for the Allied efforts to end the Kosovo crisis, as well as Romania's cooperation in promoting democracy in Serbia and advancing the process of stability and development in Southeastern Europe. US welcomed Romania's active participation in the Stability Pact, and throughout the region. We look forward to the opening of the Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) Regional Center in Bucharest to combat cross-border crime, and Romania's new responsibilities as OSCE Chairman in Office in 2001. U.S. will continue to use the Strategic Partnership to advance Romania's preparations for NATO membership, and to support Romania's economic reform program.

At NATO's 2002 Prague summit (November 21-22, 2002) Romania was invited to join the alliance. Romania became a full member of NATO in 2004. On August 1, 2002, Romania became the first country to grant U.S. citizens immunity from arrest under warrants from the International Criminal Court. Romania signed an agreement with the United States that prevents it from surrendering U.S. citizens to the international court, a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest said. The agreement was signed in Bucharest by U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton and Romania's deputy Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu. In Washington, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said the United States "very much appreciates" Romania's signing of the agreement.

In February 2003, Romanian President Ion Iliescu has reiterated his country's support for the United States in a possible war against Iraq, saying it will raise Romania's standing in the world. Iliescu reaffirmed that Romania would take part in a military intervention in Iraq even without United Nations approval. "Of course we would do that. We've already committed ourselves to that," he said. Romanian Parliament agreed on February 12,2003, to contribute non-combat troops to a U.S.-led coalition to disarm Iraq and to allow the United States to use Romania's airspace and airports. Romania will deploy almost 300 troops, including those specializing in nuclear, biological and chemical decontamination, de-mining, as well as military police and medical assistance. Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase said that Romania had not requested financial aid from the U.S. in exchange for its support. He also said Romania was interested in taking part in the reconstruction of postwar Iraq. Romania had close relations with Iraq under Communist rule of late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, which ended in 1989. Iraq owes Romania US$1.7 billion.

Romania's Foreign Affairs Minister Mircea Geoana and presidential adviser Ioan Talpes on 28 July, 2003 met in Washington with the Condoleezza Rice, the adviser for national security of President George W Bush. According to a communique from Romania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE), the meeting approached Romanian-American relations in the context of defining Romania's strategic role after getting the invitation to join NATO and the beginning of the process of ratification of protocols by parliaments of NATO member states. On this occasion, Condoleezza Rice stressed that the US administration appreciates Romania' s constant efforts in fighting terrorism, its stand and contribution to the Afghanistan and Iraq operations. Also, Condoleezza Rice mentioned the importance of Romania's support in the "freedom for Iraq" campaign for which the United States used military facilities in Romania.

The US president' s adviser for national security, the Romanian presidential adviser Ioan Talpes, and the head of Romanian diplomacy underlined the interest of both sides in a bilateral solid relation both in the public and the economic fields. Given Romania's future status of EU member state, Minister Mircea Geoana stated again Romania's interest in building a solid relation with the United States, in contributing to the consolidation of the transatlantic partnership after Central and Eastern European states' joining NATO and EU.

In March 2005, President George W. Bush said that he views Romania as a steadfast ally of NATO and a springboard for democratic reform in the Black Sea region. Bush reassured Romanian President Traian Basescu that the United States, through NATO and bilateral relations, is committed to Romania's security. "That's important for a society to recognize there are strong enough allies to allow the society to develop, to have gone from a day of dictatorial regime to one of a free society," Bush said. These came during a meeting in Washington D.C. between the two presidents. In 2005, Romanian President Traian Basescu said that Romania wants to play a bigger role in the Black Sea region, and discussed facilities that can serve as NATO and U.S. military bases in this Balkan country. "Romania wants to take a major role in providing stability in the region, and can be a strong element of balance in the Black Sea region," Basescu said after meeting with Gen. James Jones, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe. The United States used the Mihail Kogalniceanu base during the offensives in Afghanistan and Iraq, along with a terminal in the port of Constanta. Jones thanked Romania for supporting the U.S. war efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and for offering to host U.S. military bases. "I think this would consolidate NATO's flank on the Black Sea," he said. Romania has about 730 peacekeepers in Iraq and 500 in Afghanistan.
