CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4283 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, this is the US invasion of Afghanistan following 9/11. After the US deposed the Taliban government, the Taliban and other militarized rebel groups fought against US and other countries' troops in Afghanistan. Several central Asian countries, including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, assisted the US by allowing them to use their territory for bases, and several also participated in shows of force against Afghanistan before the US invaded. Coded civil war link because this was connected to rebel-associated violence in New York, outside this dyad, that led to this MID.

This dispute consists of a series of 35 militarized incidents that are centered around the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes against the United States. In response to the terrorist attacks, the United States demanded that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden and expel Al Qaeda members that were operating and training in Afghanistan. 9/15/01 - the United States, Great Britain, and France deployed naval forces to waters near Afghanistan. The United States deployed 2 aircraft carriers, Great Britain deployed 6 warships, and France deployed 2 warships. In response to the American deployment, Afghanistan placed its forces on alert and deployed anti-aircraft weapons around Kandahar. Russia, which had experienced previous disputes with Afghanistan along the Tajik border, placed its forces along the Tajik border on alert and mass weapons and troops along the border in response to the rising tensions in the region. 9/17/01 - American president Bush issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leadership to turn over Osama bin Laden or face American military strikes. The Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden unless a series of unreasonable conditions were met (trial by Muslim judge, recognition for the Taliban, foreign aid for Afghanistan, etc.) 9/22/01 - An American reconnaissance drone is shot down over Afghanistan. During this time, Great Britain began deploying special forces to Afghanistan 9/25/01 - British prime minister Tony Blair issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leaders to face military action if they do not turnover Osama bin Laden and shutdown the terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. 9/30/01 - The United States continued to increase the pressure on the Taliban by continuing to deploy forces to the region. In addition to the naval forces already deployed, the United States also sent ground forces to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and sent the USS Kitty Hawk carrier group to the region. The Taliban responded to the increasing American pressure by conducting exercises along its border with Pakistan. During this period of time Taliban forces also fired on a Russian border post along the Tajik-Afghan border. Russian forces suffered no casualties in the clash and returned fire at the Taliban forces. No information was given regarding Afghan casualties. Early October, 2001 - The British government issued a series of statements threatening military action against Afghanistan if the Taliban did not turn over Osama bin Laden. 10/6/01 - Afghanistan threatened war against Uzbekistan if the United States launched attacks from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan also began redeploying forces to its border with Uzbekistan. In response, Uzbekistan began deploying its forces along the border with Afghanistan. Reports also indicate that Afghanistan fired at an unmanned American drone conducting reconnaissance. As conditions deteriorated, Tajikistan placed its forces along the border on alert. 10/7/01 - American and British strikes on Afghanistan began. The first strikes involved attacks from cruise missiles, bombers, and missiles and initial targets were confined to airfields, command and control centers, military installations. 10/9/01 - NATO redeploys its naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the conflict in Afghanistan. Ships from Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and the United States participate in the redeployment. 10/10/01 - Following three days of sustained attacks, bombing targets began to include strikes against troops. Near this time, American and British forces began bombing Taliban forces positioned north of Kabul. These strikes involved the use of heavy cluster bombs and were likely to inflict heavy casualties on Taliban forces. These bombing strikes continued on a daily basis into November 10/16/01 - A Taliban gunman fired at a border picket occupied by Russian troops along the Tajik border. There were no Russian casualties in the attack. 10/17/01 - Reports indicate that Australian troops are now on the ground in Afghanistan conducted ground operations against Taliban and AlQaeda forces. 10/19/01-11/13/01 - US commando units began conducting ground operations within Afghan territory. These ground raids were used to attack Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces, flush them out for airstrikes, and for intelligence purposes. Two American soldiers were killed when their search and rescue helicopter crashed in Pakistan after a mission. These deaths are not counted in the dispute coding because they were accidental and did not result from military action. Allied airstrikes continue throughout this period. 11/13/01 - Russia "took additional security measures" along its border with Afghanistan. Taliban forces withdraw from Kabul and Northern Alliance troops take the capital. Because the Taliban has lost control of the capital, the dispute ends. First day of dispute was on 10/6/2001 and last day of dispute was on 10/00/2001.

Uzbekistan became independent on December 25, 1991. On February 10, 1992, Uzbekistan denied reports that it was arming rebel factions in Afghanistan and it stated that it respects the arms embargo on Afghanistan. Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have established formal diplomatic relations, according to reports from Tashkent on October 15, 1992. Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who went to the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan for an official visit, discussed with Uzbekistan president Islam Karimov on bilateral relations and economic cooperation. The two leaders agreed on a plan under which a road will be constructed linking Uzbekistan with the Pakistani port of Karachi via Afghanistan. Uzbekistan needs access to the Indian Ocean to activate its weak economy but this route has to pass through Afghanistan. It was estimated that the construction of the route will cost seven to ten billion dollars and will take several years. Karimov said that he hoped the world community would be willing to invest in the project. An alternative way which is still under consideration goes from Hindukush mountains and passes through Kabul and northern Pakistan.

Afghanistan's President Borhanoddin Rabbani went to Uzbekistan on 13th October, 1992, and it is envisaged to talk with the President of that Republic, Karimov, about the situation in Afghanistan. Commentators of Radio Message of Freedom believe that Rabbani's visit to Uzbekistan has raised open questions. At a time when only two weeks has left for Rabbani's reign to be ended and it is necessary that talks should be held between jihad leaders regarding the next phase, his visit to Uzbekistan strengthens the doubts that he wants, through attracting the attention of foreign countries, to prolong his term. Commentators say that Rabbani's visit to Uzbekistan complicates matters also that during the last three days the Amir of Hezb-e Eslami-e Afghanistan [Hekmatyar] expressed a strong protest at that republic's foul interference in Afghanistan. Commentators add that if Rabbani, through foreign pressure or other trickery, attempts to lengthen his term in office, it would further increase the complexity and danger of matters.

On October 19, 1992, during a meeting with journalists at the close of his business visit to Uzbekistan, Borhanoddin Rabbani, leader of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, positively assessed the results of the visit, during which he toured Tashkent, Samarkand and Bukhara. He had talks with President Islam Karimov. The two heads of state emphasized that the meeting at the summit level became an important stage in the establishment of interstate relations between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, the peoples of which are brought together by traditional ties of friendship and cooperation. Speaking about the developments of the Afghan-Tajik border, Rabbani said ''We shall do everything possible to secure that peace there is subsequently established.'' He stated that the leadership of Afghanistan opposes the smuggling of arms across the border. The head of the neighboring state did not conceal the fact that there are armed forces in his country that do not obey the authorities and supply arms to feuding groups in Tajikistan. For his part, Karimov said all the states in the region are interested in the establishment of good-neighborly relations between the two countries. A big role in this respect, in his view, will be played by the construction of a Termez-Karachi highway. This will be of benefit to both Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, and to all the other countries in the region. Rabbani invited Karimov to pay an official visit to Afghanistan.

The last MID of RIV1283, MID4283 ended Uzbekistan's participation at the end of October, 2001. On March 4, 2002, an Afghan delegation headed by the head of the interim government of Afghanistan, Hamed Karzai, was continuing its 2-day visit to Uzbekistan. The interim prime minister of Afghanistan has been received by President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan. The meeting focused on regional security and the restoration of Afghanistan. Hamed Karzai, who is on a two-day visit to Tashkent, thanked the Uzbek leadership for its assistance in the establishment of peace and stability in Afghanistan. Journalist Abduvali Soyibnazarov has more on this. The aim of the visit to Uzbekistan by the head of the Afghan interim government, Hamed Karzai, is to strengthen the new economic and political relations between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, which are now forming, and consider aspects of future cooperation. Developing bilateral economic relations and supplying electricity to the northern areas of Afghanistan are being considered first of all at the talks. The length of the Uzbek-Afghan common borders is 200 km, and at present the majority of humanitarian and economic aid to Afghanistan is delivered through our country. Uzbekistan is also taking part in the restoration of Afghanistan. Our country's participation in the Tokyo meeting of donor countries also proves this. Today Uzbekistan is expected to give humanitarian aid to Afghanistan worth 350,000 dollars. Peace and stability in Afghanistan is beneficial for our country, both from the point of view of security and the economy. Neighboring states will live in peace if Afghanistan lives in peace. This in turn will push investors towards investing both in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. From an economic point of view Uzbekistan will get access to the Indian Ocean via Afghanistan. Third, Uzbekistan will have the opportunity to enter the world market, reach the Persian Gulf via Afghanistan and sell electricity.

On 8 August, 2002, the head of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan, Hamed Karzai, announced that it wants to expand relations with Uzbekistan, in economical, social and cultural fields. On Wednesday night 7 August, receiving the credentials of the new ambassador of Uzbekistan to Afghanistan in Kabul, Karzai said that the expansion of relations with neighboring countries of Afghanistan, including Uzbekistan, is beneficial to both sides, and to the development and prosperity of the region. He added that the policy of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan is based on peace and friendship with all countries, and so wants to expand relations with all countries, including neighboring ones. Karzai said that the government of Afghanistan assesses the expansion of friendly relations on the base of mutual respect for the political independence, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity of each other as beneficial to the people of both countries. He hoped that the mission of the new ambassador of Uzbekistan in Kabul will be useful for the expansion of relations between the two countries. During the ceremony the ambassador of Uzbekistan also delivered a message from the president of his country Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, to Karzai. In the message, Karimov supported and welcomed the latest developments in Afghanistan under the wise leadership of Karzai, and added that the government and people of Uzbekistan are ready to cooperate in every way for the implementation of the wishes and aims of the people of Afghanistan.

On August 23, 2003, the head of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan Hamed Karzai in talks with the ambassador of Uzbekistan in Kabul, said that Afghanistan and Uzbekistan are the two countries standing in the common front of the campaign against extremism. This joint aspect has brought the two countries closer. Afghanistan wants the expansion of commercial ties with Central Asia. It is in the interest of the both countries to pursue this objective. Later the ambassador of the Republic of Uzbekistan Alisher Ahmad Jonov spoke and placed emphasis on the implementation of the trilateral agreements signed between Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. He expressed his country's willingness to help in the establishment of a railway linking Hayratan to Mazar-e Sharif. He also highlighted the important of the expansion of trade relations between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. In this respect, he spoke about the visit of a delegation from that country in the near future.

On December 8, 2003, Uzbekistan opened its embassy in Afghanistan and signed its first protocols on closer cooperation between the countries in a show of support for President Hamid Karzai, officials said. Uzbek Foreign Minister Sadyk Safaev and his Afghan counterpart Abdullah Abdullah signed documents covering commerce, transit and transport cooperation at the foreign ministry just before Safaev opened Tashkent's embassy in Kabul. "The main goal of my trip to Afghanistan is to show the support of Uzbekistan for President Karzai, Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and the policies of the Afghan cabinet," Safaev said. Uzbekistan's first agreements on cooperation with Afghanistan would not be the last, he said. Abdullah said the protocols would help the development of the country's Central Asian neighbours and the region. The deals will benefit the transit trade in both countries, with Uzbekistan getting a swifter route towards sea ports in Iran and Pakistan and Afghanistan getting better access to Central Asia, said Afghan Commerce Minister Sayeed Mustafa Kazemi. Both countries are working on the possibility of building a 60-kilometre (38 mile) railway from the Uzbek border post of Termez to Afghanistan's main northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, he said. Termez is on the Amu Darya river, the historical Oxus, which forms the 130 kilometer border between the two countries. Northern Afghanistan has many ethnic Uzbeks.

On 29 August, 2004, the foreign minister of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan, Dr Abdollah, arrived in Uzbekistan at the head of a high-ranking delegation on Saturday afternoon 28 August to hold talks with Uzbek officials. Afghan and Uzbek officials were to exchange views and hold talks about expanding trade and transport relations, the Uzbek government's involvement in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, cooperation in combating terrorism and agreeing a number of strategies for combating drugs. Uzbekistan is to the north of Afghanistan and is one of the main Central Asian states, with a population of more than 25m. Afghanistan is located between Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to experts, boosting relations between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, is, therefore, very important. Afghanistan and Uzbekistan share a common culture, religion, tradition and race, and that will help the two countries to strengthen their relations. After the fall of the Taleban regime and two decades of war, Afghanistan is going through a reconstruction phase. Thus, the Kabul government is expecting Uzbekistan to get involved in this process within the limits of its capacity. As well as being members of the ECO Economic Cooperation Organization, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan have also signed agreements with a number of neighboring countries within the framework of regional cooperation. Iran, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan signed a tripartite agreement last year to establish a highway between these three countries. The production of narcotics in Afghanistan, which has increased considerably over the past few years, and their smuggling to other countries, has caused concern to countries of the region, particularly to the Central Asian countries. Drug traffickers have been smuggling drugs to Russia and other European countries via the northern neighbors of Afghanistan. After all, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan need to have serious relations to combat terrorism and drugs, and one can expect that during the Afghan foreign minister's visit to Uzbekistan a positive step will be taken to strengthen bilateral cooperation.

Afghanistan's future depends on fruitful cooperation with all the Central Asian states, the minister of foreign affairs of Afghanistan, Abdollah Abdollah, said on August 30, 2004, in Tashkent, where he is on an official visit. Abdollah Abdollah arrived in Tashkent on 28 August with a government delegation which includes the Afghan minister of finance, minister of public transport and other high-ranking officials. Abdollah said that "Uzbekistan, with its active economic and technical assistance plays an exclusively important role in the construction of a new Afghanistan, in particular in the construction of roads and bridges". Builders from Uzbekistan have constructed 10 out of the 12 planned in Afghanistan's north. This "will again make Afghanistan the main transport corridor linking the Central Asian countries with the ports of the Persian Gulf and the states of South-East Asia", Abdollah said.
