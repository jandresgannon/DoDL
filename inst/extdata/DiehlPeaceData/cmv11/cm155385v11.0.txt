ISLMID: MID2840 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID2840 2 -- somewhat uncertain
ISLMID-NOTES: from NYT 3/5/1948, a Norwegian fishing vessel was warned by an Argentine naval vessel that she must have Argentine permission to anchor at a British-claimed island, Deception Island. It is unclear why Chile is involved in this MID against Norway. Coded not islands because although this does seem to be connected to an island that is disputed between Argentina and Norway, the island dispute is not between the countries of this dyad. Coded somewhat uncertain because itâ€™s not clear why Chile is involved in this MID.
