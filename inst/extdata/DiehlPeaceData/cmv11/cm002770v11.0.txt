PS-UPDATE2020:This remains a lesser rivalry despite extensive US aid to Pakistan since 9/11. There are periodic and unauthorized US drone strikes and covert actions on Pakistanti territory and Pakistan has been accused of harboring Taliban and other "terrorists" as part of its rivalry with Afghanistan.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID4552 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4552 from cm narrative, occurred 12/30/2002-5/22/2005. As the US occupied Afghanistan, it deployed troops to the Afghan-Pakistan border to prevent rebels from Pakistan from crossing over into Afghanistan. Eventually, US troops began crossing over into Pakistan and attacking the rebels in Pakistan, contributing to this MID. However, this is coded civil war MID because the rebels in Pakistan were involved in civil conflict in Afghanistan (outside of this dyad), but this MID involved the US attacking the rebels inside Pakistan. There was therefore rebel-associated violence within this dyad as part of this MID. 

CIVWARLINK: MID4552 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4552 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4452 from cm narrative, the US crossed the Afghanistan-Pakistan border into Pakistan to attack rebel groups in Pakistan. Afghanistan troops had been mobilized to the border to prevent rebels from attacking Afghanistan from Pakistan, which resulted in border clashes between Pakistani and Afghani troops as part of this MID. The US also deployed troops to the border in their efforts to cross into Pakistan to attack rebels, as well as to prevent rebels from crossing into Afghanistan. Coded civil war link because the rebels in Pakistan were waging an insurgency in Afghanistan, outside of this dyad, and the US attacked them during its occupation of Afghanistan, triggering this MID.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan border was a source of tension for Pakistani forces and Afghan-American forces. In several instances, the Afghan military deployed additional troops to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to secure the frontier against incursions by rebels from Pakistan. These border troops periodically exchanged small-arms fire with Pakistani troops, but it appears the localized conflicts were simple exchanges of hostilities and not part of larger offensives. At the end of 2002, the US military became increasingly involved, deploying its own troops to the border with Pakistan and beginning direct attacks against rebels in Pakistani territory. First day of dispute was on 12/30/2002 and last day of dispute was on 5/22/2005.

In a continuation of MID70509, US military drones routinely attacked suspected Taliban and Al-Qaeda sites in the Waziristan region of northern Pakistan.

During 2008 and 2009, US forces carried out several attacks against suspected Taliban and Al-Qaeda hideouts in the mountainous regions of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border. These attacks were mostly carried out through unmanned drones, although, in some rare instances, the attacks were conducted by manned helicopter gunships. On a few occassions, Pakistani troops fired at these aerial forces, resulting in brief, but deadly, clashes. First day of dispute was on 1/29/2008 and last day of dispute was on 3/12/2009.

NATO air forces routinely entered Pakistan to launch air strikes on suspected Taliban hideouts. In one incident, a NATO helicopter engaged Pakistani soldiers at a border outpost after the soldiers began firing, killing 3.

This is clearly a gray zone case, but in general we follow COW on MIDs, and the numerous and frequent MIDs justify this as a .25. There are reports that the government was not "sincere" in its protests, given that Pakistan might tacitly approve of the military actions, but only protests when domestic public opinion merits it. COW either (1) judged them as sincere or (2) or allowed insincere protests to count. It also could be that the Pakistani government is divided on this.
