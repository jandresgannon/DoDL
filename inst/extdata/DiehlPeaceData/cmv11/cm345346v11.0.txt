This MID occurred in Bosnia as Yugoslav and Bosnian forces fought for control of Bosnian territory. Eventually, Yugoslavia bowed to international pressure and withdrew most of its troops from Bosnia. As that happened the bulk of the fighting turned to the militias, i.e. the Bosnian Serbs versus Bosnia. Since the Bosnian Serbs are not state actors their fights with Bosnia do not enter into this MID. First day of dispute was on 4/6/1992 and last day of dispute was on 1/25/1993.
