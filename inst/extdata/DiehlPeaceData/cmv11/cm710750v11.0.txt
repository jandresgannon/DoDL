PS-UPDATE2020:This reverts back to a lesser rivarly with a clash on June 15, 2020 between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley – the worst fighting in four decades (https://www.stimson.org/2022/chinas-evolving-strategic-discourse-on-india/) o	This brawl left 20 Indian solders dead, and an unspecified number of Chinese casualties o	“The Indian strategic community is broadly in agreement that this border dispute marks an implacable decline in India-China ties. They argue that the very basis of relations that emerged after former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s visit to Beijing in 1988 has been shaken, if not destroyed” (https://carnegieindia.org/2021/03/10/road-from-galwan-future-of-india-china-relations-pub-84019) o	“The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas. Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry” (https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-intelligence-says-india-china-relations-will-remain-strained-2964540) •	Continued actions that contributed to rising tensions: o	“Adding to the complexity of crisis management, in 2020 both China and India extended their land border confrontation into other areas of their bilateral relationship. The moves were intended to signal resolve and communicate the costs of escalation. Indian signaling included its June 2020 deployment of a warship to the South China Sea, which immediately drew Chinese objections; a ban on fifty-nine Chinese web apps, including WeChat and TikTok, from Indian markets; and new barriers to participation by Chinese companies in a variety of Indian infrastructure projects, such as highway construction. Chinese signaling included engineering a brief but debilitating October 2020 electrical blackout in Mumbai through a cyberattack by Chinese hackers” (https://www.cfr.org/report/preparing-heightened-tensions-between-china-and-india)

Chinese soldiers briefly crossed over the CHN-IND border into Arunachal Pradesh, which is disputed between the two countries, and briefly detained and interrogated some Indian border patrol guards. Although the Chinese forces detained Indian troops, it was not for a period long enough to warrant a seizure and no force was apparently used, so only the border violation is coded. First day of dispute was on 6/26/2003 and last day of dispute was on 6/26/2003.

NARRATIVE-CM:
China and India disputed the Aksai Chin border region beginning on November 20, 1950 (MID2088). India argued that the *McMahon Line* represented the eastern part of the border between the two countries, although the Chinese claimed to have never agreed with the British on the McMahon Line as the border.

Six non-aligned countries (Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia) mediated negotiations between the parties between December 10, 1962 and February 22, 1963. Chinese troops withdrew from northeast India between December 1, 1962 and January 29, 1963. China and India preliminarily accepted the proposals by the non-aligned countries on January 19, 1963. The *Commonwealth of Nations *(CON) provided military assistance (14 military advisors) to India beginning on January 30, 1963. China rejected India's interpretation of the proposals by the non-aligned countries on March 5, 1963. India protested against the signing of a border agreement by China and Pakistan on March 2, 1963.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The Sino-Indian border has never been formally demarcated by mutual treaty between the two states. While no formal international agreement exists over the formal border, there is a line of actual control that is generally accepted by both countries with two key exceptions. The Indian claim in the region is a holdover from the period of British rule in which the British pushed their claim to the border in the eastern disputed regions of Tawang and Walong to the "McMahon Line" which roughly follows the crest of the Himalayas. China claims control over the disputed territories based on a prior claim of Tibet to the two tribal areas as well as a handful of small areas outside of the two major regions. In the west, the boundary roughly follows the Karakoram range and is largely consistent with the Chinese claim. The disputed Aksai Chin region lies between the Karakoram and Kunlun mountain ranges. India claims that the Aksai Chin region is part of the Jammu and Kashmir state, while China claims that the territory is divided between Xinjiang province and Tibet.

The 1962 war (MID199) between China and India resulted in little change of actual territory. The Chinese withdrew to pre-war borders following the implementation of the cease-fire. Continued border clashes between Chinese and Indian troops have continued since the war's end. China supported Pakistan with arms and economic aid during the Indo-Pakistani war in 1965 and continued to provide large amounts of military equipment and technical aid throughout the 1960's and 1970's. After the breakup of Pakistan in 1971, the threat to India presented by Pakistan decreased and China was perceived to be the greatest threat to Indian security. 

Sino-Indian relations thawed in 1976 with the exchange of ambassadors. China had become more concerned about threats from the Soviet Union following the Chinese-Soviet border clashes of 1969, and began to pursue a policy geared towards reducing the potential threat from India. In 1978 a high-level delegation from China met with Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai. Beijing used Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu to pass along to India the Chinese willingness to reopen border discussions and to seek a peaceful resolution of outstanding issues between the two countries. The Indian Foreign Minister visited Beijing in 1979. The Chinese and Indians held eight rounds of border talks between 1981 and 1987 aimed at reducing tensions and resolving the outstanding border disagreements. In 1988 a formal summit was held between the leaders of China and India which marked the full normalization of relations between the two countries

In 1993, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited Beijing for a summit which led to the signing of an agreement in which both sides agreed to maintain peace and tranquility along the border region based on the actual line of control. This remains largely the status quo.

The thaw in relations between India and China took place in the context of changing superpower rivalry and both states deliberately used their changing relations with the superpowers as part of the resolution process. China's opening to the United States forced similar actions by India beginning in 1973. The change in Soviet Asia policy under Gorbachev in 1985 geared towards more friendly relations with all Asian states helped to limit the concerns of both China and India that the other side may be in the process of pursuing an alliance with an outside superpower.

SB-CR:
People's Republic of China / India Years: 1950-Present. Issues at stake: Border between China and India. End coding: Continuing as of 1988, no border settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 10. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1986. Wars: 1962. Summary: The border disagreement between China and India center around two areas, the Aksai-Chin region on their western border, and the border between India and Tibet. Borders were never mutually accepted by the British and Chinese while the British controlled India, although the British tried to set borders on several occasions. This was in part due to the difficulty in establishing a border in the mountainous terrain. India's borders at independence were established by British maps drawn a half-century earlier. In 1899 the British proposed a division in western India known as the McCartney-McDonald line, which was ignored by China. At the 1913 Simla conference, Britain advanced the McMahon line as a boundary with Tibet, but China again refused to ratify the boundary, which had moved the border significantly in India's favor relative to other earlier agreements. Even though it was never accepted by the Chinese, the British accepted the McMahon line as India's legitimate border, and the Indians pursued this claim after independence. The first dispute between the newly independent India and the PRC occurred when India protested the Chinese occupation of Tibet. By 1954 China and India had signed a Treaty of Peaceful Co-Existence, but both sides quickly alleged border violations by the other and moved forces into disputed regions. Border skirmishes continued, eventually escalating to the Sino-Indian War of 1962. In the war China defeated India and established control over most of the strategically important Aksai-Chin region, giving it access to Tibet from its westernmost province of Xinjiang. Frequent border incidents followed the war, and Indian control over the Sikkim region became more important as well, as China refused to recognize Sikkim as a protectorate of India (it was officially incorporated as the 22nd Indian state in 1975). Relations improved in the late 1970s, with official normalization of relations in 1976, but large numbers of troops were maintained by both sides along the border, and disputes occurred in 1979 (military alerts) and 1986 (large scale clashes coupled with border demands by both sides and the occupation of some Chinese territory by India). No formal delineation or acceptance of the border has occurred, and the Chinese still hold territory in the Aksai-Chin that India claims as its own. Sources: Hammond World Atlas (1992).

India became independent on August 15, 1947. The Indian government announced on March 27, 1948, the appointment of Sardar Panikkar as the ambassador to China. On October 19, 1949, India's Prime Minister Nehru hinted at the possibility to recognize Communist China's government. On August 21, 1949, India rejected the idea of an anti-Communist pact in East Asia, aimed at Communist China and Soviet Union. On November 1, 1950, China made it clear to India that the Tibetan invasion by Communist forces was an internal Chinese affair and asked India to stay out of its domestic affairs.

The last MID of RIV1299, MID2102 ended on June 4, 1987. Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandi of India visited Beijing from December 19 to December 23, 1988, during which the parties agreed to establish a joint working group to resolve the border dispute. This was the first trip to Beijing by an Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru went in 1954. The Sino-Indian working group met from June 30, 1989 to May 13, 1991.

In a visit that portends major realignments in Asia, China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, arrived in New Delhi on December 11, 1991. It was the first trip by a Chinese head of Government in more than three decades. India, long allied with the Soviet Union, has been thrown off balance by the calamitous disintegration of its former ally and has struggled to find a handhold in a changing world order. Now, presented with overtures from China-like India an enormous, largely rural, developing country-India sees the potential in establishing a new structure of international relations involving a new set of alliances. Not since Zhou Enlai met with India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, 31 years before, has a Chinese leader set foot on Indian soil. Since Mr. Zhou's visit in 1960, relations between the two Asian giants, which together embrace some 40 percent of the world's population, have wavered between outright belligerence and merely chilly. In that time, India, for decades an ally in all but name with the Soviet Union, and China have fought a vigorous border war, have jousted verbally over international disputes in Cambodia and Afghanistan and have differed over India's granting refuge to the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama. A major concern for India in discussions with Mr. Li is China's traditionally close and supportive relationship with Pakistan, with which India has fought two wars and which India insists is the major sponsor of separatist militancy in Kashmir. Indian officials, according to a Foreign Ministry official, are hoping to extract some assurance from Mr. Li that China will not provide Pakistan with surface-to-surface missiles as part of its weapons sales to Islamabad. It was unclear this evening, from either officials at the Chinese Embassy or from Chinese journalists, what concessions China was willing to offer India in its dealings with Pakistan. Mr. Li's visit was greeted with outrage and protests by Tibetans who have taken refuge in India from China's occupation of their homeland. Just hours before the Chinese leader's arrival, the police detained hundreds of Tibetans protesting his visit and engaged in bloody clashes with thousands of others attempting to march on the Chinese Embassy. But now, China and India find themselves adrift and isolated amid the rapid changes in the Soviet Union and Europe. China, still ostracized internationally because of its human-rights record, and India, stranded by a self-imposed economic isolationism, are struggling to find new partnerships in an emerging global order neither appear to like very much. "It is historic," said a Western diplomat watching the visit from the sidelines. "It is important. The Indians are feeling a bit lonely in the world. This visit holds a whole lot more for India than for China. The only thing the Chinese have to gain is to pick up an ally in terms of issues like human rights and to find a friend to resist U.S. hegemony."

Indian and Chinese officials signed agreements on trade, diplomatic representation and scientific cooperation on December 13, 1991, in a move that signaled the end of three decades of strained relations following the 1962 border war. Chinese Premier Li Peng, midway through a six-day visit to India, congratulated the Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, as Cabinet ministers from the two governments signed the agreements in the Rashtrapati Bhavan presidential palace. The agreements call for cooperation in space technology and will lead to the resumption of border trade between the world's two most populous nations. The countries also agreed to open the consulates in Bombay and Shanghai that were closed following the 1962 war. China also had a consulate in Calcutta while India maintained an office in Lhasa, Tibet, before the border war, but there was no indication the warming of Indo-Chinese ties would lead to a reopening of these diplomatic offices anytime soon. India is the home of thousands of Tibetan refugees who have fled persecution in their homeland. The government-in-exile of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist god-king, is based in Dharmsala, 230 miles northwest of New Delhi. Tibetan refugees, who oppose the brutal Chinese occupation of their homeland, continued their protests, burning a Chinese flag at a refugee camp in the Majnu-ka-Tilla district of the capital and staging a demonstration outside the Chinese Embassy. Police arrested about 80 people at the two locations but there was no repeat of the violence that marked the demonstrations on the day of Li's arrival in India, when officers fired tear gas and wielded clubs to disperse stone-throwing protesters. The latest arrests bring to nearly 500 the number of Tibetans who have been detained this week. Police also have detained more than 200 Kashmiri Muslims and several prominent political activists to prevent them from staging embarrassing protests. Most of the demonstrations by Tibetans have been confined to the refugee camp in far north Delhi because police have been waging a campaign to prevent them from demonstrating in view of the Chinese premier. Some protesters have managed to reach the Chinese Embassy. Li is the first Chinese leader to visit India since Chou En Lai traveled to New Delhi in 1960. Two years later, the two countries fought a border war that started in the Aksai Chin region of the Karakorum Mountains. About 70,500 square miles of territory is still in dispute between the two countries. Indian and Chinese officials have hinted the border dispute should not be difficult to resolve, but there has been no evidence of any breakthrough on the issue and the two countries have agreed the matter should not stand in the way of developing closer ties.

China has presented a new proposal to resolve its four-decades-old Himalayan border dispute with India, the Indian Foreign Ministry announced on November 3, 1992. Ministry spokesman Shiv S. Mukherjee said India has sought more details on the Chinese offer, made at the recent Sino-Indian border negotiations in Beijing. The rival delegations, headed by Indian Foreign Secretary Jyotindra N. Dixit and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xu Dunxin, held three days of talks last week. This was the fifth round of negotiations since the world's two most populous nations set up a joint working group in 1988 to discuss the frontier dispute. Mukherjee said Beijing has offered to make ''some adjustments'' in the Kashmir sector in return for reciprocal Indian concessions in the other corner of the border near Burma. He did not elaborate but said India would communicate its response to China after receiving specific details on the proposal. The two Asian giants fought a Himalayan war in 1962 which led to the Chinese annexation of Indian Kashmir's strategic Aksai Chin region. A year later, Pakistan ceded a slice of its own Kashmiri territory to China, its closest ally. The Kashmiri areas have enabled Beijing to link its two remote and rebellious provinces of Tibet and Xinjiang and build the strategic Karakoram Highway to Pakistan. China has repeatedly urged India to accept its annexation of the Kashmiri territories in return for Beijing giving up its claim over the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, which also borders Burma. The latest proposal is believed to a variant of the earlier offers. Diplomatic analysts said it probably offers small concessions in the form of slight adjustments to the existing line of control in the Kashmir sector to allay Indian security concerns. The control of strategic Kashmir is divided among India, Pakistan and China. Kashmir also borders Afghanistan and Tajikstan. The long and rugged Sino-Indian frontier has been quiet since the 1987 border clashes, which were triggered by a massive Indian Army exercise. Hundreds of thousands of rival troops, however, remain deployed along the snow-covered border. During the recent talks, the two sides agreed to implement several confidence-building measures, including an agreement to provide advance notification of border troop movements and military maneuvers. The two neighbors also have agreed to regular meetings of their Army field commanders and to set up ''hot-line'' communications links between their military headquarters. Later this month, Indian and Chinese navies are scheduled to jointly hold a small exercise off the eastern Indian coast in the Bay of Bengal. The maneuver is designed to build mutual confidence at a time when both countries are seeking to develop blue-water navies.

In 1993, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited Beijing for a summit which led to the signing of an agreement in which both sides agreed to maintain peace and tranquility along the border region based on the actual line of control. This remains largely the status quo.

The Indian Chief of Army Staff General Bipin Joshi, visited China on what is the first ever such journey undertaken by an Indian army chief to China on July 26, 1994. This visit follows two other meetings, the seventh meeting of the China-India joint working group in Beijing last month, and the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to New Delhi. According to Indian press reports, after the next two months China's Defense Minister General Chi Haotian will also be visiting India. This exchange of high level military visitors has added a new dimension to the broadening relationship between China and India. In 1992, for instance India's director general of Military Intelligence visited China and the same year the then Indian defense minister, Sharad Pawar, also visited China. Last December, The deputy chief of staff of the Peoples Liberation Army visited India. And since 1992, officers from India's National Defense College have been getting training in China. It is perhaps no coincidence that in a gesture aimed at reassuring the Pakistani military leadership regarding the durability of the Chinese connection, at the same time that the Chinese Foreign minister was visiting India and the Indian army chief in Beijing, the Chinese defense minister has been touring Pakistan. It is also meant to be a not so subtle signal to the Indian as well that the growing Sino-Indian khaki connection is not going to be at the expense of the relationship between China and Pakistan, particularly between the two countries militaries. The Chinese are experienced at sending such signals as their track record in the past indicates, particularly in the context of relations with Pakistan and India respectively. For instance, when Indian President R Venkataraman was visiting China in May 1992 for the first such visit of an Indian head of state, the Chinese had a nuclear explosion which embarrassed their Indian guests since they were not told in advance and more so, given the fact that India has always claimed its nuclear program to be in response to that of China, since China became a nuclear power in 1964 and India had its own nuclear test in 1974, or the fact that Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's September 1990 visit to China followed weeks after the American imposition of sanctions against China for allegedly supplying M-11 missiles to Pakistan, a move which India had denounced as adding to its "security threat".

Senior officials from India and China began talks on March 2, 1995, in the latest attempt to reduce tensions along their 2,500-mile (4,000-km) border. A joint working group of diplomats and military officials from the two nations met in New Delhi for more than three hours. India and China fought a war in 1962 in which China won territory in India's northeastern and northwestern border regions. Improved relations between Beijing and New Delhi have helped to reduce tensions along disputed border areas in the northern Kashmir region, where heavily armed Chinese and Indian troops continue to patrol the frontier. India and China have also been locked in a dispute over the northern Indian state of Sikkim, which was annexed by New Delhi in 1975. China saw the move as a threat to its neighboring territory and accused India of expansionism. Until recently, relations between the two neighbors have been frosty and border tensions high. The current meeting in India follows up on a ''peace and tranquility'' agreement signed when Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao visited China in 1993. This meeting is the third to focus on implementing the Indo-China pact, which includes provisions for resolving the long-standing border dispute.

Nearly 35 years after a border war that left China occupying a sprawling region of Himalayan uplands claimed by India, the two countries agreed in principle on November 29, 1996, on mutual troop withdrawals from disputed areas along their 2,500-mile frontier and pledged that "neither side shall use its military capability against the other." The pact was a centerpiece of the visit to New Delhi by President Jiang Zemin of China, the first Chinese head of state to visit independent India. He arrived for a four-day stay that has been billed by both countries as a fresh opportunity to rebuild a relationship that has wavered between bitter and wary for three decades. Apart from the pledge that they would not go to war, which has appeared in past agreements between the two countries, details were deferred for another round of negotiations, and no deadline was set for a final accord. The border agreement, signed after Mr. Jiang met for talks with India's Prime Minister, H. D. Deve Gowda, was accompanied by other measures intended to give fresh momentum to the relationship. They included a pact that looks ahead to the first direct maritime links between the two countries in modern times and an accord on joint measures to combat narcotics trafficking. In a concession valued by India because of Indian nationals living in Hong Kong, Beijing also agreed to allow New Delhi to maintain its consulate-general in Hong Kong after Britain hands the territory back to China next July. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Deve Gowda hailed the agreements, especially the pact on troop withdrawals, as a breakthrough that would set the tone for closer ties in the next century between the world's two most populous nations. The developments seemed to especially please Mr. Jiang, for whom the visit capped a week of diplomatic accomplishments. On Sunday, during a meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders in Manila, Mr. Jiang met with President Clinton and agreed to exchange state visits during the next two years, a major break for China in its bid to lessen the ostracism that followed the massacre of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But critics in India said the Government, following a long pattern in dealings with Beijing, had allowed China to resort to diplomatic evasions on the border dispute and on other issues affecting India's security, including allegations that China has supplied Pakistan with missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. By failing to challenge China more bluntly, some critics said, India underlined its weak position, which flows from the growing disparity in economic and military power between the two Asian giants. While China has one of the world's fastest-growing economies and armed forces equipped with a large and increasingly sophisticated nuclear arsenal, India has an economy that remains mired in socialist-era inefficiencies, growing at perhaps half the rate of China's, and a large but unwieldy military establishment that has a covert nuclear weapons program but so far no acknowledged operational nuclear capability. In briefings on the talks, spokesmen said Mr. Deve Gowda had skirted the issue of Chinese assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, telling Mr. Jiang only that India was concerned about the flow of "advanced weapons" into the sub-continent. Spokesmen for India said it was left to India's Foreign Minister, I. K. Gujral, to raise the nuclear issue directly in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen. Mr. Qian repeated China's denials that Beijing has aided Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.

India and China began official-level "confidence-building" talks on August 4, 1997, to reduce tension on their disputed international border, mostly in the Himalayas. Officials said the two-day "Joint Working Group" talks being held in Delhi come on the heels of Indian Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav's assertion the previous week that Beijing's military cooperation with Pakistan was "a matter of great concern to Delhi". Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath is leading the Indian side while the Chinese team is led by the Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. This meeting, the tenth in a series which began in 1989, is aimed at "resolving the boundary question in a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable manner". India and China contest each other's claim to the border. New Delhi says China is illegally occupying 38,000 square kilometers of area in Jammu and Kashmir. It also claims that "under the so-called Sino-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963, Pakistan illegally ceded approximately 5,120 square kilometers of Indian territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.

On October 17, 2000, China has strongly rejected Indian allegations that its troops were making regular incursions across the border into the Arunachal Pradesh region. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a regular news briefing that there was no substance to the allegations. "The Chinese side has all along strictly observed the Line of Actual Control along the China-India border and has been making unremitting efforts towards the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas," Zhu said. "Therefore the relevant allegations by the Indian side are baseless." Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Mukut Mithi said last week he had informed New Delhi of the Chinese incursions over the disputed border, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC). "There have been reports of the Chinese crossing the LAC. Maybe they have crossed the border without really knowing where the LAC stands, but in any case this has to be stopped," Mithi said.

Officials from India and China will meet in India on June 28, 2001, as part of long-running efforts to resolve the border dispute between the two nations, the foreign ministry said. "The forthcoming meeting will continue this process of clarifying the Line of Control (LOC) which was begun in the previous meeting in Beijing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said. At the last meeting in China in November, the group of experts decided to exchange maps of different sections of the control line. "This is the first time that maps have been exchanged. The exchange took place after Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh wrote to his Chinese counterpart that the process of clarification should be expedited," the spokeswoman said.

India and China are locked in negotiations over the kingdom of Sikkim before Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's trip to China on June 22, 2003, the first visit by an Indian premier in more than a decade. A deal on the biggest point of contention between the two countries would be a major diplomatic victory for both sides. The tiny Himalayan kingdom was annexed by India in 1975, but China has refused to recognize it as a part of India's territory. On Chinese maps, Sikkim is shown as an independent country rather than an Indian province. While India wants China to accept that Sikkim is part of its territory, China hopes for India's support on Tibet and Taiwan. "Beijing has the political will to resolve the Sikkim dispute. But we have to prepare our people, particularly hardliners among the Communist Party," a senior Chinese diplomat told The Telegraph newspaper. "And there are bound to be questions like: what is India going to give China in return for recognizing Sikkim as a part of India?" Analysts say that settling the issues is important to Mr Vajpayee's government, leaving the central government in a position to extract significant concessions in return for China's co-operation. On paper, India recognizes Tibet as an autonomous part of China and follows a one-China policy. Relations between India and Taiwan are restricted to trade and economic co-operation. According to a high-ranking Indian official, protests and demonstrations by Tibetan exiles whenever a Chinese dignitary visits India are another irritant to ties. Similarly, China dislikes the open support for the Tibetan cause by some Indian politicians. China finds India's explanation that India is a democratic country unsatisfactory. The official disclosed that China had protested unofficially about the presence of Taiwanese officials at a recent seminar on Asian security in New Delhi organized by the Institute of Defense and Strategic Analysis, an Indian government-funded think-tank. Foreign Affairs writer Pranay Sharma said the Sikkim issue was the easiest to resolve among the disputes affecting India-China relations. The invasion and occupation of Sikkim angered the mainland, which considered the Buddhist kingdom within its zone of influence. Relations between India and China-already strained by the 1962 war, suspicions and rivalry-worsened further as China threatened to give political asylum to Sikkim's dethroned ruler, Palden Thondup Namgyal. China's military co-operation with India's nuclear rival, Pakistan, has also reportedly figured in the diplomatic haggling before Mr. Vajpayee's visit. The Telegraph quoted a Chinese diplomat as saying: "When India's relations with Pakistan become normal, India will stop feeling so concerned about China's relations with Pakistan."

India officially recognized Tibet as a part of China, according to a joint declaration signed on June 25, 2003, by visiting Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.

China said the first round of the India-China strategic dialogue in New Delhi started on January 25, 2005, would help solve a nagging border dispute between the two countries, Agence France-Presse reported. Asked whether he believed the talks would have a positive impact on the dispute, foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said: "Very simply, yes." `The two sides have expressed the goodwill to properly resolve the issue. We expect to work hard with India ... so bilateral relations can proceed even faster on a new foundation," he said. Both sides are engaged in discussions to resolve the lingering boundary issue with special representatives holding several rounds of talks since June 2003. These talks between delegations led by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei and Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran focused on a regional and global issues including multi-polarity, non-proliferation and terrorism. Kong described the talks as "very successful," adding that they were conducive towards regional stability. Ties between India and China have warmed since a visit to Beijing by then-premier Atal Behari Vajpayee in June 2003. Later that year, Indian and Chinese forces took part in naval exercises off Shanghai for the first time, opening a new chapter in military ties.

China has recognized the Himalayan territory of Sikkim as a part of India, and the two countries have reached consensus on principles leading to an overall settlement of their decades-old boundary disputes, an Indian foreign ministry official said on April 11, 2005. "A new map which the Chinese have published shows Sikkim as part of India. This is no longer an issue between us," Shyam Saran, a top official in the External Affairs Ministry, told reporters following talks between Indian leaders and visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. Sikkim, located between Nepal and the kingdom of Bhutan, was an independent principality before it was annexed by India in 1975. China never recognized Sikkim as an Indian possession and has claimed part of the territory as its own. But in 2003, China removed Sikkim from a government Web site that showed it to be a part of China, a sign it was moving toward officially recognizing the area as part of India Border disagreements have long embittered relations between India and China, leading to a brief war in 1962. India says China still holds 41,440 square kilometers (16,000 square miles) of its territory in the Kashmir region, while Beijing lays claim to a wide swath of territory in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 1,046-kilometer (650-mile) border with China's Tibet region. Saran said the two sides have "reached a consensus on the text of political principles and guiding principles for settlement of the boundary dispute.

Premier Wen Jiabao ended his four-day visit to India on April 13, 2005, with a reaffirmation of the two countries' relationship as "friendly neighbors" rather than rivals. "India, China are brothers," he told reporters after what he described as a historic visit. "We have taken this relationship to a new level. "Some people describe India and China as competitors. I disagree," he said before leaving New Delhi. He quoted Amartya Sen, the Indian professor who is the only Asian winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, as saying that both sides could learn from each other: "To view China and India only as rivals is no different from reducing global communication and understanding to a horse race. "He also said people should ask what China and India can learn from each other, not who would outdo whom. I cannot agree with the professor more," the premier said. "Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and opening, once said that only when both China and India became developed could the Asian century become reality. "China hopes to see a peaceful and prosperous India but by the same token, a peaceful and prosperous China is also in India's interests," he said. Reiterating Beijing's support for India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, Mr Wen said China would welcome India's participation in more international organizations, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. On the need for a multipolar world view, Mr Wen said that by working together, China, India and Russia could fulfill their common goals of bringing stability and democracy to the world. "I have to stress the co-operation and exchanges between the three countries are by no means an alliance, nor is such co-operation targeting any countries," he said. He said China was building up a border market opposite Sikkim, which Beijing now recognizes as part of India. "As long as we have sincerity and patience, we can definitely turn the Chinese-Indian border into a peace-and friendship-making hub," he said. Wrapping up his four-nation South Asian visit, Mr Wen said China had signed more than 50 bilateral agreements, most of which were related to trade. He said Beijing could work with India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on a range of fronts as trade among them remained small but had the potential to grow significantly. He said the mainland and India could complement each other in hardware and software respectively.

India plans to hold tourism road shows in major Chinese cities in 2005 to woo more tourists to Western and Southern parts of the country, official sources said in Beijing. "We are planning to hold a comprehensive tourism road show in China in by October-end to attract more Chinese tourists to India," said Regional Director (East Asia) of Indiatourism, G Venkataraman. The road shows would be held in cities like Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu and Indiatourism will be cooperating with Air India to woo more Chinese tourists to newer Indian destinations in Southern and Western India, which would also help reduce pressure on the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle's tourism infrastructure. He noted that there was 53.1 per cent increase in the number of visas issued to Chinese visitors in 2004 and the proposed road shows would generate more awareness among the people about key tourism destinations in India. Chinese tourists are emerging as one of the main supporters of the tourism industry in Southeast Asia. According to official Chinese figures, from January to May Chinese citizens made 12.26 million outbound visits, increasing by 9.7 per year. Revenues from outbound tourism business reached 18.404 billion yuan (US $2.23 billion) in 2004, a year-on-year increase of 75.07 per cent. Indiatourism, which participated in the recently-concluded Beijing International Tourism Expo, received enthusiastic response from Chinese tour operators, Venkataraman said.

The year of 2006 was marked as the `India-China Friendship Year' by the Indian authorities. This was decided at the visit of Wen Jiabao to India in 2005. On March 11, 2006, India and China held the seventh round of talks to find a framework acceptable to both sides for resolving their longstanding border dispute. India's National Security Advisor MK Narayanan and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, began talks at the Hyderabad House in the Indian capital to reach an "agreed framework for a boundary settlement." Naryananan and Dai are designated as special representatives to conduct negotiations on border issues. After holding the talks in New Delhi, the two delegations are due to continue their talks at a retreat in southern Kerala state. India and China had chalked out a set of guiding principles and parameters to solve border issues during Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to India in 2005. The boundary dispute, which involves large areas along their 4,000-kilometre border, is a bitter legacy of the 1962 war between the Asian giants. China occupies part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region with India accusing Pakistan of illegally ceding it to Beijing. India alleges that China illegally occupies 43,000 square kilometers of land in Kashmir (which New Delhi calls Aksai Chin) while China has laid claim to large parts of India's northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state and earlier claimed Sikkim. Improving bilateral ties in the past few years have facilitated the dialogue on the boundary issue. In 2003, India said it recognized the Tibet region as an autonomous part of China and Beijing recognized Sikkim as part of India while both sides decided to appoint special representatives for finding a solution to the boundary question. The NDTV network reported that the two sides are working at solutions, which will include not disturbing settled populations and adjustments based on "new geographical realities." "However, the tougher question to settle is India's claim on Aksai Chin and China's insistence that Arunachal Pradesh is theirs," the channel reported. During the talks, the Indian side is also expected to convey to Beijing that its growing relationship with Washington is not aimed at containing China, official sources said. The two sides will also discuss possible high-level visits including Indian Premier Manmohan Singh's visit to China and the Chinese President Hu Jintao to India this year. Before starting the parleys with Narayanan, the Chinese representative met with the Indian Premier Singh.
