CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3908 from Gibler 2018, this MID occurred in 1989, during the Lebanese Civil War and the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. A Maltese tanker was hit by Syrian and Lebanese artillery, triggering this MID. From Washington Post 8/30/1989, Malta was attempting to break through the "Syrian-imposed naval blockade to bring fuel to the besieged Christian sector of Lebanon." Coded civil war link because the force being used was connected to the Lebanese Civil War, outside this dyad.
