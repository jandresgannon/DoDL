Late in September 1999, the Venezuelan government dismissed the border agreement they had with Guyana and protested oil exploration concessions awarded by Guyana in the Esequibo region of their disputed maritime border. Later, on October 3, 1999 Venezuela moved its troops close to their border with Guyana. When Guyana protested these Venezuelan moves along the border, Venezuelan officials claimed that the troop buildups were linked to drug trafficking exercises, not intimidation tactics. They announced that they would never attempt to achieve their goals through the use of violence. Two days later, two Venezuelan helicopters crossed the border near a military post near Etetringbang, northwest Guyana. As a result of increasing tensions on their disputed border, on October 6, 1999, the Guyanese government put its army on full alert. Despite Venezuelan announcements that they would never use force, Venezuela maintained its claim on Guyanese territory, and there were no settlements. First day of dispute was on 10/3/1999 and last day of dispute was on 10/9/1999.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Venezuela reasserted its claim to the Essequibo region of Guyana following Guyana's independence on May 26, 1966. The Prime Minister of Guayana protested the Venezuelan occupation of the Ankoko island in the Cuyani river, and demanded the withdrawal of Venezuela personnel and installations on the island on October 14, 1966. Venezuela rejected the protest on October 18, 1966. Venezuelan troops and Guyanan troops clashed on February 19-22, 1970. After three months of negotiations facilitation by Trinidad and Tobago, the countries signed the *Protocol of Port-of-Spain *on June 18, 1970 which placed a 12-year moratorium on the territorial dispute. Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmeirca of Cuba expressed support for Guyana in January 1981. Guyana protested an alleged Venezuelan military incursion in the disputed territory to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council on May 10, 1982. Venezuela proposed bilateral negotiations with Guyana on July 1, 1982, but Guyana rejected the proposal on August 20, 1982. Guyanan troops and Venezuelan troops clashed in the disputed territory on September 3-5, 1982. Guyana referred the matter to the UN Security Council on September 14, 1982. Guyana and Venezuela agreed on March 23, 1983 that the UN secretary-general should act as a mediator in the dispute. The UN secretary-general sent an envoy, Diego Cordovez, to the countries from August 21-26, 1983. The UN secretary-general appointed Sir Alister McIntyre of Grenada as his personal representative concerning the dispute on February 1, 1990.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Venezuela and Guyana stems from a dispute over the territory of the Essequibo owned by Guyana. The territory is supposedly rich in resources such as petroleum, timber, and bauxite. In the early nineteenth century Great Britain and Spain never clearly delineated the territory although Spain claimed it. After Venezuela's independence from Spain, Venezuela pursued the Spanish claims. In 1899 the territory was given to Britain via international arbitration. Guyana received its independence from Britain in 1966 and thus inherited the territory along with the dispute with Venezuela. Upon Guyana's independence, Guyana and Venezuela immediately entered into conflict with border incursions by Venezuela taking place in October 1966, MID1166. Two additional disputes took place in January 1969, MID2239 and February 1970, MID2240, that led to border negotiations between both sides. In 1970, the two countries signed the Port of Spain Protocol that put off the dispute for 12 years. The protocol called for international mediation at the end of the 12 year period if the two countries were unable to resolve the dispute. Three additional mids after 1970, MID2317, MID2237 and MID3085 demonstrated both sides' inability to resolve the dispute either peacefully or through militarized conflict. To this date, despite domestic political and economic changes and international mediation, the dispute remains unresolved. The last militarized dispute over this territory occurred in 1999, MID4260, ending a 17 year hiatus.

By April 1982, prior to the beginning of the last mid in May, Guyana faced bankruptcy. Its debts of $35 million were rescheduled in 1982 and 1983. The gross domestic product of the country had declined .5% with the country's major industries all suffering major losses. Also, Guyana's exports were 26% below expectations. These economic conditions were taking its toll on the government of President Forbes Burnham and the People's National Congress party with groups such as the Guyana Conference of Churches calling for a coalition government to be formed. On October 3, 1982 President Burnham accused Venezuela of aggression against Guyana and claimed that his country needed to prepare for the possibility of armed conflict. On October 13, 1982 Guyana sought to gain a UN directive on ending the dispute with Venezuela. On October 19, 1982 Brazil extended Guyana $50 million in credit to purchase military equipment. On November 18, 1982 at a summit meeting of the Caribbean Community (Caricom), the leadership issued a declaration supporting Guyana in its dispute over Venezuela. Further support occurred in July 1983 and the next summit. Despite continuing economic ills, President Burnham rejected IMF terms for a loan on May 6, 1983. On May 6 and May 19, 1983 bauxite workers striked to protest food shortages. On August 18, 1983 the US vetoed a $10 million loan by the Inter-American Development bank requested by Guyana. On January 10, 1984 Guyana devlaued its currency by 20%. On January 20, 1984 Guyana did manage to secure a loan from the IDB totalling $40.7 million. On August 6, 1985 President Burnham died and was replaced by Prime Minister Desmond Hoyte. This was the first transition of power for Guyana since 1964. Elections in December 1985 kept Hoyte in power. By February 1987, Guyana had devalued its currency by 56%. On January 8, 1991 Guyana became a member of the Organization of American States. By 1991, Guyana started seeing growth in its economy at 6.1%. On October 5, 1992 Cheddi Jagan of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) defeated President Hoyte in national elections. On March 6, 1997 Cheddi Jagan died from a heart attack, leading to Samuel Hinds (Prime Minister) begin sworn in at the interim president. On December 19, 1997 Janet Jagan won the presidential elections in Guyana. Demonstrations were held against the elections, however, as many opposition supporters accused the President of holding fradulent elections. Although Caricom officials found that the election was fair on June 2, 1998, riots broke out in the capital of Georgetown on June 17, 1998. On August 8, 1999, Jagan resigned due to health reasons and Bharrat Jagdeo of the PPP took office. Jagdeo was re-elected on March 19, 2001. 

In Venezuela there was a major military buildup in an effort to modernize its armed forces in June 1981. This build up was sanctioned by the US and included selling F-16 fighters to the country. Venezuela during this period was a rather important Cold War ally of the US in Latin America and in a meeting in May 1981 the two discussed the land dispute with Guyana at the time of discussing arms sales. As early as June 1982, Venezuelan President Luis Herrera Campins claimed that there would be no resort to force to resolve the conflict, rather it would be solved through international law. It should be pointed out that Campins' claim occurs near the end of the Falklands/Malvinas War in the region in which Argentina was internationally criticized for using force to resolve a territorial dispute. On September 28, 1982 Venezuela joined the nonaligned movement, seemingly in an effort to improve its relations with Cuba in order to facilitate assistance in resolving the dispute with Guyana. Cuba, prior to Venezuela's joining of the nonaligned movement had been strongly on the side of Guyana in supporting its rights over the Essequibo. By 1983 Venezuela was facing debt repayment problems, with foreign debt at $33 billion. Oil revenues had fallen over $1 billion from 1982 to 1983. Unemployment was at 15% and rising. On December 4, 1983 Jaime Lusinchi of the Democratic Action party won the presidential elections in Venezuela. In June 1984 Venezuela closed the state bank that was over $400 million in debt. In September 1984 the government managed to attain refinancing agreements with its creditors. On April 11, 1987 protests in Caracas over President Lusinchi's government. The protestors numbered over 25,000. On December 4, 1988, former president Carlos Perez was elected to another term. Perez like Lusinchi was a member of the Democratic Action party. Civil unrest continued under the Perez administration. From February 27-March 1, 1989, 300 people were killed in riots protesting government increases in transportation and gasoline prices. These increases were part of a series of measures required to qualify for an IMF loan package. In May 1989, Venezuelan workers organized a general strike in protest of these measures. This marked the first such strike in over 30 years. On February 4, 1992 Venezuelan forces defeated rebel military groups attempting a coup in Caracas. The coup was apparently in response to rising prices and increased governmental corruption. On November 27, 1992 rebel military forces attempted another coup against the Perez government. Despite the widespread dissatisfaction with the Perez regime, the president vowed to continue his term until it ended in 1994. On April 15, 1993, Venezuela's attorney general petitioned the Supreme Court of Justice to determine whether or not Perez could be arrested on charges of corruption. On May 27, 1993 President Perez was suspended from office and accused of misappropiating funds to which he would face an impeachment trial. On June 5, 1993 Ramon Mujica was elected interim president. On December 5, 1993 Rafael Rodriguez was elected into office. On December 11, 1995 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency, the bolivar, by 41.4%. On December 6, 1998 Hugo Chavez Frias was elected president. On December 15, 1999 Venezuelans voted to adopt a new constitution. Chavez was re-elected in July 2000, only to face severe internal turmoil that resulted in a 48 hour coup. The coup was reversed after widespread protests against the new rulers, military revolts and international condemnation. Despite his retention of the office of president, Chavez faces continuous internal disruption due to an oil workers strike which has crippled the economy. 

In terms of direct relations, Guyana and Venezuela agreed on March 23, 1983 that the UN secretary-general should act as a mediator in the dispute as stipulated in an agreement signed in Geneva by both countries in 1966. This agreement stipulated that each side would settle the dispute without resorting to force. The UN secretary-general sent an envoy, Diego Cordovez, to the countries from August 21-26, 1983, with no success. On February 1, 1990, the UN secretary-general appointed Sir Alister McIntyre of Grenada as his personal representative concerning the dispute. 
Again, the two countries even with UN mediation have been unable to settle the dispute. Consequently, this continuing dispute leads to the question of whether or not the rivalry is concluded. 

While the two sides have agreed to the resolution of the border issue without the use of force, the agreement in 1966 and the Port of Spain Protocol in 1970 did not eliminate militarized conflict. Relations between the two countries have been very good, however, as evidenced by Venezuela's sponsoring Guyana's request for OAS membership in 1990. Also in 1990, the Guyanese defense forces and the Venezuelan army signed a protocol to establish improved relations. These improved relations consisted of facilitating cooperation in training, sports and culture. The protocol has an indefinite deadline. 

Considering these factors, along with the internal disruptions Venezuela has dealt with since 1982 (particularly since protests and strikes began under the Lusinchi government in 1987), it did not appear that Venezuela fostered plans to pursue the settlement of the dispute with the military. This perception changed in 1999 when Venezuela began strongly voicing its discontent with the issue again, leading to tensions between the two sides along with another MID. On September 24, 1999, Guyana's coast guard captured a Venezuelan fishing vessel in its territorial waters, MID4260. On October 5, 1999 Guyana accused Venezuela of crossing its borders along with troop build-up along the border. On October 6, 1999 the Guyana coast guard arrested another Venezuelan fishing vessel. These incidents suggest that earlier actions to improve relations might not have been as successful as the two countries had hoped, leading to the likelihood of the rivalry continuing into the near future as militarized conflict remains an option as it has in the past.

Guyanan troops and Venezuelan troops clashed in the disputed territory on September 3-5, 1982. Guyana referred the matter to the UN Security Council on September 14, 1982. Guyana and Venezuela agreed on March 23, 1983 that the UN secretary-general should act as a mediator in the dispute. This period is considered a transition until the two countries agreed on an official UN mediator for the dispute.

Since the 1985 death in office of President Forbes Burnham, who had led Guyana since its independence, relations between the two countries have gradually improved and diplomatic efforts have helped to steer the border dispute into the halls of the United Nations. The thaw in relations between the two countries began in 1986 when Venezuela agreed to trade its petroleum for Guyanese bauxite after Trinidad and Tobago ceased oil supplies to Georgetown because of unpaid bills. Since current Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez took office in 1989, political and economic relations between the two countries have improved significantly. In August 1992, Venezuela backed Guyana for a seat at the United Nations Security Council. Relations between Venezuela and Guyana, clouded for years by the dispute over the Essequibo, which Venezuela says is part of its territory, have warmed in the past three years as a result of an aggressive diplomatic offensive by the Perez government. Guyana backed Venezuela's admission as an observer on Caricom, a 13-member grouping of Anglophone Caribbean countries, as well as a free trade accord proposed by Venezuela under which Caricom products will enter Venezuela free of duty from early 1993. Venezuela, for its part, was a member of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) support group, which backed structural adjustment reforms in Guyana, he recalled. In 1992, relations between the two countries have taken such a positive turn that the possibility of Guyana granting Venezuela a corridor to the Atlantic and joint development of the Essequibo is being discussed. The two countries have also been placing emphasis on developing trade and economic ties. In 1991 Venezuela financed the construction of a 1000-seat sports gymnasium in Georgetown and a health sciences faculty at the University of Guyana, and abolished import duties on 50 Guyanese products, including timber, bauxite and agricultural produce. The two countries have also asked the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to finance a project under which Caracas would supply Guyana with hydro-electric power from the Guri dam in Venezuela's Guayana region, which borders on the Essequibo. However, despite the rapprochement, the border issue has not been buried and there is an awareness that it could erupt again. Several negotiation meetings during the 1990s, but neither country was keen to solve the dispute. In 1998 during an official presidential visit from Guyana to Venezuela, the two sides pledged to reach an agreement regulating environmental issues in the disputed area, where mining and timber concessions by the Guyanese government have angered Venezuela in recent years. The agreement is seen as a confidence-building measure in talks deadlocked under the auspices of the UN general-secretary since 1989. In January 1999, a top Guyanan official said his government is not satisfied with Venezuela's explanation for an incursion into Guyana's airspace by military jets on New Year's Day. Venezuela told Guyanese officials that the flight was a New Year's air salute to Venezuelan soldiers along the border, but Guyana Defense Secretary Roger Luncheon said Saturday his country expects a better explanation. It appears that even though the border dispute did not disappear from the foreign policies of the two countries, a determined initiative to improve the bilateral relations is the dominant theme of this period. 

The last MID of RIV10273,MID4260 ended on 19991009. Two weeks after Barbadian jurist Oliver Jackman was appointed the United Nations (UN) good officer in the border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela On October 10, 1999, the government of Guyana promised him its full support. The jurist and diplomat replaced Sir Alister Mcintyre, who served in that position for eight years. On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the International Arbitration Tribunal award of 3rd October 1899, Venezuela announced that it was renewing its claim to the mineral-rich land mass. Venezuelan military planes flew over Guyana on this day. Subsequent movements by Venezuelan troops near the border caused the Guyana government to complain to the UN. But the Venezuela government insisted that the troops were only involved in an anti-drug exercise. 

In 2000 Guyanese Foreign Minister Clement Rohee dismissed Venezuelan claims to the Essequibo region and said Venezuela had been unable to justify its claim before the international community. In August 2000, the UN good officer, Ambassador Oliver Jackman said the Venezuelan government informed him of its objection to the Beal Project-a 100m-dollar investment deal between Guyana and the American company Beal Aerospace Technologies Inc. for the establishment of a rocket launch site in the Essequibo region. He added that Venezuela also complained that Guyana awarded licenses to a number of oil companies which, in its view, violated Venezuela's maritime sovereignty. He requested both governments to tone down their rhetoric over their disputed territory. 

On December 1, 2001, Guyanese President Bharrat Jagdeo considered that Guyana's relations with Venezuela are improving despite a century-old border dispute. Jagdeo said he met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez after a Caribbean summit but that they didn't discuss Venezuela's claim to roughly two-thirds of Guyana, the 64,000-square-mile (160,000-square-kilometer) mineral-rich Essequibo region. Venezuela does not recognize an 1899 treaty that gave the then-colony of British Guiana the Essequibo. Under a 1966 agreement, the United Nations has been trying to resolve the dispute. Jagdeo said he and Chavez will take up the issue at a summit next year. During the Caribbean summit, Guyana signed the Caracas Energy Cooperation Pact, which gives Caribbean and Central American nations 15-year loans at 2 percent annual interest to pay for oil purchases. Jagdeo and Chavez also discussed building a Caribbean coastal road connecting Guyana and Venezuela and allowing Guyanese citizens to use a road connecting Venezuela with the northern Brazilian city of Boa Vista. Guyana lacks a national road network. "I see a considerable warming of relationships," Jagdeo said. "I think that both countries understand that if all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean get closer together, border matters will fade into insignificance." Venezuela's foreign minister, Luis Davila, visited Guyana on November 30th-December 1st 2001. However, Venezuela shows no sign of retreating on its claim to 70% of Guyana's national territory, together with a large and potentially valuable area of Guyana's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In 2002, the Venezuelan and Guyanese foreign ministers met in Caracas in October to discuss a possible fisheries agreement, the supply of oil on concessionary terms under the Caracas energy accord, and other areas of economic co-operation. The conclusion of a fisheries agreement will be difficult as long as Venezuela maintains its claim to most of Guyana's exclusive economic zone, but both sides have agreed to reactivate the UN mediation process on the border issue.

The last MID of RIV10273, MID4260 ended on 19991009, however the dispute over the Essequibo region continues at lower levels. On February 19, 2004, Guyana and Venezuela signed a joint communique which includes a 12m-US-dollar debt write-off and an assurance that Caracas would not invade its South American neighbor over a long standing land dispute. Chavez blamed "imperialistic machinations" for the history of trouble relations between Guyana and Venezuela linked to the border controversy and its claims to more than 60 per cent of this country's 216,000 sq. km. territory. He said the controversy was kept alive by Washington during the decades of the 1960s to the 1980s to "avoid another Cuba in Guyana". Although the two leaders did not discuss the border controversy directly, they "reiterated their countries' commitment to the Good Offices process and expressed appreciation for the work of Oliver Jackman, the personal representative of the United Nations' secretary-General". Venezuela will now work to find an amicable solution to the problem, and this, Chavez said "does not include an invasion of Guyana's territory". During their meeting Jagdeo and Chavez focused on the issue of deepening cooperation, especially in the areas of the economy, agriculture, investment and culture. Chavez also wants bilateral relations to expand in the areas of education and health care, drug trafficking and trans-border crime and "any other area mutually agreed to". Jagdeo committed himself to be Venezuela's chief advocate in Caricom. The agreement came at the end of a one-day visit on 19 February 2004 by Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez

In October 2004, Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president, made an official visit to Guyana. Chavez said he would not discuss Venezuela's claim to the Essequibo region during this visit, though Guyana government officials have said the issue is on the agenda. Chavez was also to discuss selling oil at preferential rates under an agreement Venezuela signed with a dozen Central American and Caribbean nations in 2000. Relations between Guyana and Venezuela have at times been strained over Venezuelan claims to the entire western two-thirds of Guyana's land area.

For the period 2004-2006, Venezuela's separate disputes with Guyana and Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) members were also on hold, but could re-emerge if Venezuelan political priorities shift. These disputes hinge partly on fishing rights, but have become heated, mainly because of significant marine oil and gas potential. They are unlikely to be resolved in the near term as procedures at the UN Law of the Sea Tribunal are generally slow. In 2006 Guyana and Venezuela planned to restart stalled talks to resolve a long-standing border dispute, but without any apparent urgency. In April 2006, Venezuela's plans to hold military exercises off its coast raised questions in neighboring Guyana, which has long resisted claims on its territory by its larger South American neighbor. In May 2006 Guyana's Foreign Affairs Minister Rudy Insanally said there have been no new developments regarding the long-standing border dispute with Venezuela. In September 2006, Guyana supported Venezuela in its bid to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council. In October 2006, Venezuela's Defense Minister Gen. Raul Isaias Baduel, acknowledged that border soldiers fired on Guyanese miners and that one miner was killed. This was part of an attempt by Venezuela to crack down on illegal smuggling across the border and had nothing to do with the disputed region.

Discussion:
On September 24, 1999, Guyana's coast guard captured a Venezuelan fishing vessel in its territorial waters, MID4260. On October 5, 1999 Guyana accused Venezuela of crossing its borders along with troop build-up along the border. On October 6, 1999 the Guyana coast guard arrested another Venezuelan fishing vessel.
MID4260 Late in September 1999, the Venezuelan government dismissed the border agreement they had with Guyana and protested oil exploration concessions awarded by Guyana in the Esequibo region of their disputed maritime border. Later, on October 3, 1999 Venezuela moved its troops close to their border with Guyana. When Guyana protested these Venezuelan moves along the border, Venezuelan officials claimed that the troop buildups were linked to drug trafficking exercises, not intimidation tactics. They announced that they would never attempt to achieve their goals through the use of violence. Two days later, two Venezuelan helicopters crossed the border near a military post near Etetringbang, northwest Guyana. As a result of increasing tensions on their disputed border, on October 6, 1999, the Guyanese government put its army on full alert. Despite Venezuelan announcements that they would never use force, Venezuela maintained its claim on Guyanese territory, and there were no settlements.
