NARRATIVE-CM:
Netherlands' ambassador to Venezuela was expelled by President Cipriano Castro on July 22, 1908 following charges that the Netherlands was harboring political refugees on islands off the coast of Venezuela. Netherlands blockaded Venezuelan ports beginning on November 7, 1908. Netherlands and Venezuela resumed diplomatic relations on April 18, 1909. Netherlands and Venezuela signed a convention for the resumption of diplomatic relations in Caracas on May 11, 1920.

NARRATIVE CR: 
There are two groups of militarized disputes. The first group involves the harassment of Dutch shipping and involves three mids (MID1493 on 5/15/1849, MID1497 on 2/15/1869 and MID1063 on 8/15/1908). Significant political changes occurred in Venezuela during the 20 year gap between the first and other two disputes, suggesting that these conflicts may not be rivalry. In 1848, the Paez regime in Venezuela was ousted by General Jose Monagas. This replacement led to the first militarized dispute as the Monagas regime held The Netherland's neighboring colony of Curacao partly responsible for Paez trying to return to power in 1849. Consequently, Venezuela halted Dutch shipping in its ports and seized or destroyed Dutch property. Monagas was ousted the following year, however. Monagas' ouster led to instability within Venezuela and periods of civil war and unrest throughout the last half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. MID1497 in February 1869 and MID1063 in August 1908 involve shipping incidents as well, either the seizure of Dutch ships or Venezuelan ships seized in retaliation to port closures and destruction and/or seizure of Dutch property in Venezuela by government or revolutionary forces. These disputes were initiated by two Venezuelan dictators (Guzman Blanco in 1869 and Cipriano Castro in 1908) and were not part of any long standing dispute between the two countries. In 1908, Castro's dispute led to the seizure of a port by The Netherlands in addition to the partial destruction of the Venezuelan navy. In 1908 Venezuelan Juan Vicente Gomez came to power, imposing political stability until his regime ended until 1935. 

The second group of mids involved a disagreement over ownership of Aves island (MID1494 on 12/12/1854 and MID1495 on 3/15/1856).Venezuela and The Netherlands signed an arbitration agreement on August 5, 1857 (ratified on October 13, 1858) authorizing Queen Isabel II of Spain to settle the dispute over Aves Island. On June 30, 1865 Queen Isabel ruled in favor of Venezuela. On March 30, 1978 both countries signed an agreement delineating the maritime boundary between Venezuela and the Dutch West Indies. The treaty was ratified on July 30, 1978.
