PS: 20050803-20100529 0.25 20100530-20209999 0.00

PS-UPDATE2020:This lesser rivalry has evolved into a serious rivalry, with all of the following occurring - proxy conflicts in the Syrian civil war, targeted assassinations, Iranian support of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel strikes agains Iranian positions and allies in Syria (and elsewhere), Israeli diplomatic rapproachmant with Arab states in the Middle East who oppose Iran, and heightened threat rhetoric. 

PSNOTES: Relations between Iran and Israel started to worsen during the presidency of Mahmud Ahmedinijiad on August 3, 2005. Since then both countries have been invoiced in proxy conflicts and covert operations. Iran has been supporting Hezbollah with weapons and personnel during the 2006 Lebanon War. In 2009, Israel is also alleged to have carried out a series of air strikes in Sudan aimed at Iranian arms beings smuggled to the Gaza Strip through Sudan to help Hamas. On November 4, 2009 Israel intercepted a ship carrying weapons from Iran on their way to Lebanon’s Hezbollah guerrillas. During the year 2010, Israel carried out covert operations particularly aiming at disrupting Iran’s nuclear program by allegedly assassinating Iran’s nuclear scientists. On May 05, 2013 Israel strikes Iran missile shipment meant to aid Hezbollah. Rivalry still continues with both countries on opposite ends conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War. We date the shift to a serious rivarly to the onset of the first MID between the two states - 20100530
