NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the United States and North Vietnam centers on the ideological differences between the communist government of North Vietnam and the desire of the US to support the anticommunist regime of South Vietnam. This rivalry is embedded in the larger context of the Cold War. 

From December 29, 1960 until April 20, 1961 MID1363 occurs. In 1961, there was an internationalized civil war within Laos. North Vietnam, the USSR, and the Peoples Republic of China supported the Communist forces in northern Laos. The Royal Laotian Government (RLG) was supported by the USA and Thailand. There was considerable direct support from both the USA and the USSR. The USSR was airlifting supplies to the Pathet Lao while the USA was flying reconnaissance missions in support of the RLG. Neither the USA nor the USSR wanted the conflict to break out into a direct conflict between them. There was a push to resolve the conflict with a conference in Geneva. While preliminary discussion about having the conference in Geneva were ongoing, the Kennedy administration discussed intervention by SEATO. China warned Washington and Laos that should SEATO intervene it would intervene with direct military force. This threat constitutes MID1363.

MID3361 occurs from December of 1961 until March of 1962. Here the United States built up its military force in South Vietnam in support of that nation. The PRC and the USSR threatened that the build up was precipitation war. The PRC and the USSR were supporting Hanoi at the time. The PRC noted that US military escalation in S. Vietnam threatened the security of North Vietnam, its ally in the region. 

MID1353 takes place during the second Laotian Civil War that occurs from 1963 until 1973. China is involved in direct support of the Pathet Lao from May of 1962 until July of 1964. China provided direct aid to the communist forces in Laos and conducted direct military operations in Northern Laos. Much of the activity China was involved in centered on completing a road network in Northern Laos that would connect North Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. The road network would provide access of supplies and troops for the communist groups in all three countries. Chinese forces were also involved in direct military confrontation with the Royal Laotian Government. Thailand was involved in the Second Laotian Civil War from 1962 until 1973. Thailand sent troops and equipment to the rightists in the country. 

MID611 is the Vietnam War. Here the United States intervened to help South Vietnam which was a new and small nation resist subjugation by their northern neighbor, North Vietnam. North Vietnam was also receiving aid from China and the USSR during the conflict. The loss of Southeast Asia was defined as threatening the security of the United States and the collectivity of Western nations. `The sovereignties of Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries were valued not on their own merit but rather as a test of U.S. global position and credibility perception that would have a profound impact on the nature on the decision to intervene. Vietnam became important for what its loss to the communists would portend.' (Berman and Routh, 2003). 

US hostilities towards N. Vietnam ended in January of 1973. The last American troops left S. Vietnam in March of 1973. 

In 1977 President Jimmy Carter cautiously extended the olive branch to the new Vietnamese government. Academic and cultural exchanges took place at this time cultivating hope of normalization. However, in 1978, the Vietnamese government demanded reparations from the U.S. as the condition for reestablishing diplomatic ties and normalization. The US Congress then halted attempts to normalize relationships with Vietnam. 

Additionally in 1978, Vietnam further estranged relationships with the western world and the U.S. in particular. The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in response the Khmer Rouge catastrophe. The Vietnamese forced the Khmer Rouge into the jungles and established the People's Republic of Kampuchea.

In reaction to this invasion of Cambodia, the U. S. government initiated a trade embargo against Vietnam. This embargo was supported by the Western European countries and other non communist Asian countries. This U.S. lead embargo kept Vietnam from receiving the much needed foreign investments that it required to reestablish its virtually ruined economy.

In 1978, China launched a small invasion of Vietnam. Although this border conflict lasted only one month, 35,000 people were killed. On their retreat, the Chinese destroyed several towns, blew up important railways, and obliterated important power plants and a phosphate mine responsible for most of Vietnam's fertilizer.

The Vietnamese turned to the USSR in 1978 for aid as their ability to feed their population deteriorated under the embargo. This move further alienated the US from Vietnam. 

Vietnamese interference in Cambodia. 
From May of 1975, increasing border clashes occurred between Cambodia and Vietnam. This escalated into full scale war at the end of 1977. In April of 1977, there was an attempted coup against Pol Pot with the backing of Vietnam. Pol Pot then publicly accused Vietnam of trying to incorporate Cambodia into a Vietnam dominated federation. He then broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam. In May of 1978, an uprising against Pol Pot took place with the support of Vietnam. In December of 1978, regular Vietnamese forces assisted Cambodian rebels in a determined bid to overthrow the Pol Pot government. Phnom Penh fell to the Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. Vietnam then installed its own hand picked government. 

In 1988, the Vietnamese began to cooperate with the US in resolving the MIA issue. The Vietnamese government withdrew troops from Cambodian in 1989 as it made further efforts to have the trade embargo lifted. 

In the fall of 1989, the Bush administration of the US initiated consultations with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in an effort to establish a Cambodia settlement. This effort was designed to follow up on a decade long diplomatic effort by the UN and ASEAN to reach an agreement that all sides in the Cambodian internal conflicts would agree on. Vietnam was under increasing pressure by the collapse of its patron state, the USSR. It became increasingly isolated and pressured by the PRC to give up its ambitions to establish a hegemonic position in Indochina. Thus, Vietnam came to terms with the PRC. In the fall of 1991, a U.S. brokered UN Security Council framework agreement for a Cambodia peace process was accepted by all parties to include, the US, the PRC, Vietnam, other regional parties, and all factions of the internal Cambodian conflict. It was formally adopted in the fall of 1991. In early 1992, the first contingents of the UNTAC arrived in Phnom Penh to implement the peace plan. In a series of secret bilateral meetings between the leaders in Hanoi and Beijing that began in the fall of 1990, the Chinese induced the Vietnamese to accept the US sponsored UN peace plan for Cambodia. The UN verified the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the UNTAC restored a sense of civil government in 1992. In the spring of 1993, the UN administered a successful popular election in Cambodia. 

As this process proceeded, the US and Vietnam resumed efforts to normalize relations after the war years and Hanoi's 1978 invasion of Cambodia. The US pressed Vietnam to back the Cambodia peace plan and to account for US MIAs in Vietnam and Laos. These objectives were established in the `roadmap' to normalization with Vietnam. This roadmap was substantially fulfilled with the culmination of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995. 

In 1991, President Bush established a roadmap to normalization for the Vietnamese.

In 1994, President Clinton lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam after 19 years.

On April 27, 1954, the Geneva conference which ended the Indochina War produced a declaration through which France recognized the independence of Vietnam. The United States did not recognize the independence of Vietnam in 1954 and thus it had no diplomatic relations with this nation until January 28, 1995.

In 1955 the U.S.-backed Ngo Dinh Diem organizes the Republic of Vietnam as an independent nation and declares himself as president. In 1956 Fighting begins between the North and the South Vietnam. On July 8, 1959, the first American combat deaths in Vietnam occur when Viet Cong attack Bien Hoa bases; two U.S. servicemen are killed.
