TERRMID-NOTES: MID164 from Davis (1941), in 1904, an American citizen, Jon Perdicaris, was abducted by bandits in Morocco. The US government threatened the Moroccan government to get Perdicaris released, deploying warshhips with the UK (pulling UK into this MID) to Morocco. Perdicaris was released soon thereafter. Coded not territory because no boundary was disputed between any of the countries involved, and this was a diplomatic dispute that probably only became an issue due to the timing of the US presidential election.
