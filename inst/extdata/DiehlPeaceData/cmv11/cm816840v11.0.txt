This dispute is related to the issue that centers on control over territory in the Spratly Islands. Philippines increased patrols in the Spratlys as a result of the sighting of unspecified Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. Although some officials noted the sightings were part of "regular movements" in the disputed archipelago, the Philippine armed forces ordered increased patrols in the vicinity of Pag-asa. First and last day of dispute was on 8/00/1998.

This dispute is a part of the Spratlys problem among many countries. It is based on an attack by Vietnam toward Philippines. Manila is reported to have filed a diplomatic protest against Vietnam when the Vietnamese troops allegedly shot a Philippine air force plane flying over the Pigeon Reef controlled by Vietnam. Vietnam accused Philippines of seriously violating Vietnam's sovereignty and reiterated its claim to sovereignty over all the Spratly Islands. First and last day of dispute was on 10/30/1999.

NARRATIVE-CR: The MIDs between N. Vietnam and the Philippines do not, I argue, constitute a rivalry. The first mid is the Vietnam War. Here the Philippines acted in support of its primary ally, the United States. It provided a limited number of troops in support roles and sustained a limited number of casualties (i.e. less than one hundred in a seven year period.) The second two mids center on the sovereignty of portions of the Spratly Islands. The Spratly Islands have been at the center of a complicated multiparty dispute especially during the 1990s. Here the Vietnamese claimed the islands in their entirety while the Philippines made partial claims that of course overlapped those of the Vietnamese. Thus, the issue in the Vietnam War was one of ideology. Filipino involvement was also contingent on their US alliance. Furthermore, Filipino activity in Vietnam was contingent on US financial aid. The second issue is one of territory and resource acquisition. Both states have great interest in the potential for exploiting the gas and oil reserves that thus far have not been fully explored and proven. 

MID 611 is the Vietnam War. The Philippines was involved in the war from 1966 until 1973. The Philippines assisted the United States and South Vietnam in the conflict. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, US strategists feared the loss of Southeast Asia to communism. The Philippines seemed especially vulnerable. In the early 1950s, US operatives assisted Ramon Magsaysay in his bid for the presidency in the Philippines. Thereafter, Filipino foreign policy followed that of Washington. In 1964, the Philippine government joined the Free World Assistance Program. Along with South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and Taiwan, they pledged assistance to S. Vietnam. The Philippines deployed engineering units financed by the USAID. 

MID4329 occurred in August of 1998. This issue is over the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands. Much of the recent tension in the region has been centered on the Spratly Islands. It is a complex dispute with multiple parties. The prime actors in the dispute appear to be Vietnam and China. Vietnam and China each assert claims to the potentially oil rich Spratly Islands. The Islands are also claimed in full or in part by the Philippines, Taiwan, and Malaysia. In this mid the Philippines held a war game exercise with the United States near the Spratly Islands. This coincided with a decision by the Chinese to allow the Filipinos to use facilities built by China on the Mischief Reef Island, belonging to Truong Sa archipelago. The US/Philippine maneuvers were viewed as hostile attempts to establish sovereignty over the in Vietnam. 

MID4330 occurred on October 30, 1999. Here Vietnamese forces fired on a Filipino plane as it flew low over one of the islands the Vietnamese had built facilities on. The Vietnamese argued they thought the RP plane was on a bombing run. The RP said the plane was a reconnaissance plane that needed to fly low to take photographs of the newly built facilities. 

Should this dyad be deemed a rivalry the following information relates to the relations between the states relations in the last decade: 

In the past decade, Vietnam has adjusted its foreign relations to reflect the evolving international economic and political situation in Southeast Asia. The country has begun to integrate itself into the regional and global economy by joining international organizations. Vietnam has stepped up its efforts to attract foreign capital from the West and regularize relations with the world financial system. In the 1990s, following the lifting of the American veto on multilateral loans to the country, Vietnam became a member of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian Development Bank. Vietnam was accepted into the Association of South-East Nations (ASEAN) in July 1995. Vietnam joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in November 1998 and also hosted the ASEAN summit the following month. These are organizations that the Philippines are also member to. In general relations between the Philippines and Vietnam have not
