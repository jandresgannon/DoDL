NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between France and Thailand is composed of five mids. The first mid occurs in the 1890s and the other four occur between 1940 and 1952. All but the first mid is bilateral. The four mids that occur in the 20th century are all bilateral. 

At the height of European colonialism in the mid nineteenth century, survival as an independent nation was the preoccupation of Siam's conduct of foreign policy. During that time, Thai Kings forged friendly relations with as many countries as possible while making all possible efforts to avoid confrontation in order to compromise with several European pressures and demands such as signing a number of unequal treaties, granting extraterritorial rights to European citizens, and, very reluctantly, granting vast territories to Britain and France. Painful as the sacrifices were for the time being, Siamese or Thai diplomacy led to the country's survival as the only independent country in the region. However, despite this independence, the Thai engaged in a war with France and the UK in 1893. 

MID196 occurred in 1893 and included the UK. Here the French and Thai fought a war over control of Laos. The steady encroachment of the two most aggressive European powers in the region, Britain and France, gravely threatened Siam during the last years of the nineteenth century. The French dreamed of outflanking their British rivals by developing a trade route to the supposed riches of southwestern China through the Mekong Valley. Auguste Pavie, French vice consul in Luang Prabang in 1886, was the chief agent in furthering French interests in Laos. His intrigues, which took advantage of Siamese weakness in the region and periodic invasions by Chinese rebels from Yunnan Province, increased tensions between Bangkok and Paris. When fighting broke out between French and Siamese forces in Laos in April 1893, the French sent gunboats to blockade Bangkok. At gunpoint, the Siamese agreed to the cession of Laos. Britain's acquiescence in French expansionism was evident in a treaty signed by the two countries in 1896 recognizing a border between French territory in Laos and British territory in Upper Burma.

The French-Thai war occurred in 1940 and 1941. The French were defeated in World War II by the Germans in June of 1940. This led to Japanese demands for concessions in Indochina to aid their prosecution of war against China and Thai demands for territory on the common border. Siam demanded the return of territories in French Indochina in 1940. Under Japanese threat, France in 1941 accepted Japanese mediation in the Franco-Thai conflict, leading to a peace treaty in May 1941 that ceded disputed territory to Thailand. This was territory in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Siamese troops attacked Vichy French forces in Cambodia and Laos on January 9, 1941. Japan used its influence with the Vichy regime in France to obtain concessions for Thailand. As a result, France agreed in March 1941 to cede 54,000 square kilometers of Laotian territory west of the Mekong and most of the Cambodian province of Battambang to Thailand. The recovery of this lost territory and the regimes apparent victory over a European colonial power greatly enhanced Phibun's reputation. France and Siam agreed to a ceasefire on January 28, 1941. This constituted MID613. 

MID1792 occurred from April through December of 1946. French and Siamese troops clashed along the Mekong River on May 26-30, 1946. Siam referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council on July 15, 1946. The United States facilitated negotiations between France and Siam beginning in July 1946. France and Siam signed an agreement in Washington DC on November 17, 1946, which provided for the return of territories in Indochina to France and the establishment of a conciliation commission. Siam withdrew the matter from the UN Security Council. France and Siam established a five-member conciliation commission (Britain, France, Peru, Siam, US) chaired by William Phillips on May 5, 1947. The conciliation commission issued its report on June 27, 1947, which recommended bilateral negotiations to resolve remaining territorial disputes.

MID2020 occurred from July through October of 1948. I was not able to locate specific reference to this mid. This conflict takes place however during the period when France was attempting to reassert its control over Indo-China in the wake of World War II. It was a weakened great power and had extreme difficulties combating the Viet Mihn in northern Vietnam. Thailand was also an unstable country at this point. During this period in its history there were a series of coups and changes in key positions in leadership. The French forces in Vietnam may have been taking action against communist troops that provided aid to the Viet Mihn from within Thailand. 

MID2022 occurred from February through March of 1952. During this period, the French were fighting the Communists in Vietnam. The Thai Army went into a state of alert and armed its border with the French controlled Indo-China. This dispute is initiated by Thailand towards France but the hostility seems to be directed at preventing the conflict for internal control of Vietnam from spreading into Thailand. 

In the late 1940s and the early 1950s Thailand experienced a string of coups. The result was a change in leadership three times in the country in a period of five years. 

During this time the French were involved in a number of other conflicts: Indo-China war, Algerian Independence War, Tunisian Independence War, and the Sinai War. The period following the last mid with Thailand was capped by the French officers revolt in 1958. In Algiers, French officers revolted, led by General Jacques Massu; France's Fourth Republic fell, as civil war threatened. The revolt was put down by Charles De Gaulle, heading France's Fifth Republic, who also offered self-determination to Algeria and released some captured National Liberation Front (FLN) leaders. Charles De Gaulle became premier of France, then quickly and successfully moved to defeat an impending civil war over the issue of Algeria; he developed a new constitutional basis for the French republic.

Thailand in 1954 became a founding member along with the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, The Philippines and Pakistan of the now defunct Southeast Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) The apparent objective of this organization was to contain the spread of communism. The then widely-held domino theory suggest that if Thailand could be maintained as a strong and prosperous anticommunist bulwark the growing communist threat in the region might be checked and contained. 

In 1954, France began to make overtures to win over a friendly relationship with Thailand. It did this by making high level diplomatic trips to Thailand. The two motivations for these overtures were that military resupply routes to military operations in Laos crossed Thailand by air or land. Second, Thailand was a regional power with significant influence over Laos and Cambodia and France was losing control of both of those states as a part of Indo-China.

19520308-19600225 Transition

The last MID of RIV596, MID2022 ended on 19520307. The Thai Army went into a state of alert and armed its border with the French controlled Indo-China in February-March 1952. On March 8th, 1952 this state of alert ended. This dispute is initiated by Thailand towards France but the hostility seems to be directed at preventing the conflict for internal control of Vietnam from spreading into Thailand. On November 9th, 1953, Cambodia became independent from France and thus one of the major obstacles in the Thai-French relations disappeared. In April 1954, France also recognized the independence of Vietnam. Hever, the Thai and French foreign policies continued to collide for a while on the political battle in Cambodia, as well as regarding the over-flowing Communism from Vietnam to Cambodia and Laos. On February 2nd, 1954, France sent Maurice Dejean, Commissioner General for Indo-China, on a visit to Thailand to win new friends there. During his three-days visit, Mr. Dejean held talks with high-ranking Thai officials. France's interest in Thailand is related to the fact that the most convenient transportation routes for the French conflict in Laos pass through Thailand. Secondly, France wanted Thailand to remain neutral in the Indo-China conflict still engaging France at the diplomatic level in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. In the previous months, Thailand started taking some steps to the dislike of the Paris Government, by providing weapons to Cambodia and military observers to Laos. Thailand also flouted the idea of stronger alliances with Laos and Cambodia, in a move set to annoy France, because that would mean weakening France's interests in the region.

France and Thailand signed a treaty of cooperation on February 26, 1960, regarding air control. In October 1960, King Rama IX and Queen Sirkit made an official visit to France. In November and December 1966, two more accords, regarding a medical facility and a training center, both built in Bangkok with French support, were signed. In 1966, the French-Thai Chamber of Commerce was established. On September 3rd, 1978, the French Foreign Minister, de Guiringaud, made an official visit to Thailand where he met with his counterpart. He noticed the need that the two countries should cooperate more and welcomed the agreement for cultural and technical cooperation signed between the two countries in 1977. The little official contact between France and Thailand as well as the few treaties signed in peripheral fields, during the 1960s and 1970s, signals that neither of them wanted the relations to be very close, and that a certain state of animosity persisted. In March 1982, Regis Debray, special adviser to the French President has reaffirmed that France has called for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. In a statement issued in Bangkok following his visit to Thailand, Mr Debray said that France has also called for a peaceful settlement of the Kampuchean problem. He visited Thailand on a fact-finding mission entrusted to him by the French President. In Thailand, he held talks with top Thai officials on the refugee problem and the situation in South-East Asia. Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda made an official visit to France in May 2, 1982, in which issues as the conflict in Cambodia and the refugee problem facing Thailand were tackled. In the same month, France tried to approach Thailand to conduct negotiations with the Vietnamese government for a cessation of hostilities in Cambodia. Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said in April 1984 that France was concerned about and discontent with the recent Vietnamese troops' intrusions of Thai border areas. Siddhi said that during his stay in France, he exchanged views extensively with his French counterpart Claude Cheysson on international as well as bilateral issues, particularly on the Cambodian problem and the situation in the Southeast Asian region. Siddhi said France showed sympathy with Thailand in that Thailand is heavily burdened by the new exodus of Indo-Chinese refugees into Thailand, and promised to accept 5,900 more refugees from Thailand by July 1984. The Thai Foreign Minister said France pledged to further increase economic and cultural exchanges with Thailand. The Thai Foreign Minister said he had asked France and other members of the European economic communities to buy more Thai goods, increase their investment in Thailand and help Thailand improve its east coastal industrial projects and Bangkok's urban traffic. Trade between Thailand and France increased sharply to 800 million US dollars in 1988, according to official figures. In 1988, Thailand's exports to France increased by 30 percent over that of 1987 to 520 million US dollars, the Thai exports to France included garments, jewelry, rice, foods and mineral products. Thailand's imports from France, which included machinery, steel and electrical equipment, were valued at 280 million US dollars in 1988, an increase of 15 percent over 1987. In November 1989, Thailand has asked France to reduce import tariffs on Thai canned food, especially tuna and pineapple. The request was made by Deputy Prime Minister Pong Sarasin during his meeting with French Minister of Foreign Trade Jean-Marie Rausch, who visited Thailand recently. Thailand also urged the French private sector to invest more in Thailand or undertake joint ventures with the Thai private sector, especially in petrochemical industry at Mab Ta Phut on the eastern seaboard. The two countries also agreed to expand bilateral trade which has now risen only 2.4 percent annually. On January, 20th, 1990, the prime ministers of France and Thailand declared strong support for Cambodian peace talks set for Indonesia in February and vowed to help rebuild the region's economies once there is peace. ''We are in favor of the kind of regional meeting that has been proposed by Indonesia,'' French Prime Minister Michel Rocard told reporters after his meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan. Rocard and Chatichai discussed economic cooperation during much of their nearly four hours of meetings. Rocard said he hoped French businesses would win some role in Thailand's ambitious plans to improve its infrastructure for telecommunications, transport and energy. The visit by Rocard was the first to Thailand by a French prime minister in more than 300 years of diplomatic relations. France made a strong appeal in May 1992, for an end to violence and a "democratic dialogue" between the government and the opposition in Thailand, where dozens of people have died in three nights of political violence. "France will use all the means at its disposal to convince the Thai authorities to undertake a democratic dialogue-the only means likely to lead to a true solution to the crisis," George Kiejman, the French junior minister for foreign affairs, told the national assembly. In November 1992, the French oil company Total has offered Thailand's state-owned oil exploration company a 30 percent stake in its gas field concession off the Burmese coast. An official at the Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration and Production (PTTEP) said she was unable to confirm Total's offer but stressed that PTTEP was interested in acquiring gas from the concession for power generation in Thailand. France will increase its investment in Thailand and will allow more Thai products to enter France. These were what French Deputy Foreign Minister Oidier Bariani assured that Foreign Minister Sitthi Sawetsila during their meeting on 18th December, 1987, in Bangkok. Considering that France holds less than 1% of foreign investment in Thailand, Mr Bariani said he would urge more French businesses to invest in Thailand. In May 1994, the European Union (EU) envoy to Thailand offered his services as a mediator in the trade row between Thailand and France. EU Ambassador to Thailand J. Gwyn Morgan pledged to Thai Commerce Minister Uthai Pimchaichon that he would quickly find out whether the French ban of Thai seafood products was in compliance with EU regulations or whether it had acted on a unilateral basis. Morgan also urged Thailand not to take any retaliatory measures, including a decision to submit the case to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, until he found out further details. France said the previous week that it would ban all Thai seafood imports, due to a problem over inadequate inspection documents from the independent agency which certifies the imports. Thailand blasted France for discriminating against its seafood products and threatened to retaliate by raising taxes on luxurious goods imported from France. Even though France exported about US$ 1.7 billion in 1995 to Thailand, which is one of France's main trade partners in Asia, France's share in Thailand's foreign trade and foreign investment remains low-1.8 percent of Thailand's imports and 2.2 percent of its foreign investment stock. France won mainly large-scale contracts, and the flow of French businessmen to Thailand is increasing. With 3,500 people, French residents in Thailand now represent the third largest French community in Asia, after India and Japan. "President Jacques Chirac's visit to Bangkok and his speech about a new partnership with Asia has created a favorable climate for French businesses in Thailand. France was seeking in 1997 to boost the influence of small and medium sized French businesses in Thailand as part of a strategy to increase its economic clout in the region. Hosting a seminar on the role of small-and medium-sized businesses, French Ambassador to Thailand, Gerard Coste, said France wanted more of its entrepreneurs to set up shop in Thailand and bolster an already strong presence of larger firms. Coste said that while a number of leading companies from France were already established in Thailand, particularly in the construction and communication sectors, smaller companies were essential to cement the French presence. Christian Jalabert, president of the Franco-Thai Chamber of Commerce, said establishing in Thailand could breathe new life into companies whose access to the booming markets of Asia were barred by their geographical position. "Thailand is without doubt a platform which allows you to reach markets which most companies cannot reach from France," he said. France is the seventh largest foreign investor in Thailand with 2.1 billion francs (370 million dollars) invested from 1970 to 1996. "France and Thailand are developing a privileged relationship. The two countries are co-organizing the Business Forum which will hold its first meeting in France in fall 1996 and its second in Bangkok next year," he added. The Business Forum, created in February 1996, "is meant to solve trade and investment problems on both sides", said Somprasong Khomapat, director of the Thailand Board of Investment in Paris. In 1998, France was interested in investing in Thailand's petroleum exploration, power and construction materials industries. Gerard Coste, the French ambassador to Thailand, outlined the interests of investors from his country at a meeting with Industry Minister Somsak Thepsuthin. The envoy also asked Mr Somsak for more details of Thai government policy regarding foreign investment in the sectors. French Minister for Foreign Trade Jacques Dondoux led a parliamentary and business delegation of 40 members for a three-day official visit in Thailand starting February 22, 1999. Dondoux discussed a wide range of bilateral and multilateral economic and business issues with Thai ministers. The minister and his delegation met with the French business community at a Forum of French Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand. Bilateral trade between France and Thailand has increased tremendously in 1998, French exports to Thailand being boosted by the delivery of eight Airbus aircraft for Thai Airways International. Thai products are performing very well in France, breaking an all time record in value (almost 1.4 billion Euro), and showing a surplus in favor of Thailand. At the end of his visit, Jacques Dondoux had to answer to angry Thai farmers which had misunderstood the French with regards to the European Commission's decision to cut tax privileges for Thailand. At the press conference on the final day of his three-day visit to Thailand, Dondoux was bombarded by questions relating to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) tax concession. Thai farmers have launched a campaign against French products out of their dissatisfaction towards the European Commission's decision to end tax concessions on Thai farm goods since the beginning of this year. He said his mission to enhance bilateral relations with Thailand seemed to have run into some problems given the anti-French campaign following the GSP cuts. "In this respect, we confirm that France has never taken a hostile position or affected Thai interests in the GSP issue." He said news on GSP in Thailand deviated from the fact that the decision came from the European Commission and not the French government alone. Dondoux said the GSP was not an obstacle to trade because Thai exports to France last year increased by 18 per cent whereas Thailand imported 33 per cent less from France, indicating that Thailand is facing serious economic problems. A group of 18 farmers' associations have earlier accused EU of protectionism. They also launched a campaign against EU products, especially French, as well as placing advertisements in local papers to air their anger towards the EU. In February 1999, France agreed to improve military cooperation with Thailand in a number of areas including an offer to increase the number of cadets trained in France. These happened at the culmination of an official visit to Thailand by French Defense Minister Alain Richard. Speaking at a press conference, Richard said he had spoken to Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai about how the two countries could strengthen military cooperation by sharing defense information and discussing security concerns. In February 1999, France has also offered Thailand loans for transport and communications projects, especially railway development schemes. During meetings held in Bangkok between the Thai Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban and the French Foreign Trade Minister Jacques Dondoux, France showed interest in the development of Thailand's railway and air traffic networks, to link Thailand with neighboring countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and China. In May 2000, France hopes to sign an agreement on protection of investment with Thailand in May during a series of meetings of the Asian Development Bank. The signing of the agreement, delayed due to the pending process of privatization in Thailand, would help boost investment and provide security to investors from both countries, French Minister for Foreign Trade Francois Huwart said. He said French investment in Thailand was doing well with last year's French investment ranking fourth after Japan, the United States and Hong Kong. In 2001 the economic and commercial counselor to the French Embassy in Thailand, Jacquez Torregrossa, listed France as Thailand's 19th largest investor. During an official visit to the French capital, in April 2001, Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai has asked France to co-operate with Thailand's drug suppression efforts through the UN Drug Control Programme. In talks with Hubert Vedrine, his French counterpart, Mr Surakiart also asked France to play a role in fostering national reconciliation in Burma and to have "economic engagement" with that country. France expressed interest in backing construction of another bridge across the Mekong river to link Thailand with Laos and Vietnam. He also called for French participation in the tourism, telecommunications, and energy sectors, as well as in the construction of a deep seaport. France expressed interest in co-investing in the Thai-Cambodian overlapping zone, and in transport links between northern Thailand and South China. France wants to enter into a "new era of economic partnership" with Thailand, which it wants to be a gateway for its economic co-operation with Thailand's neighbors, Mr Surakiart said. During the talks, France has also agreed to help persuade the European Union to extend trade privileges for Thai rice. Francois Huwart, the French foreign trade minister, was also described as being sympathetic to Thai fears of being adversely affected by the EU's current review of standards and other import measures for farm products. An official visit to France by Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's Prime Minister, scheduled for May 10th-14th, 2003 is considered another crucial step to strengthening Thailand's international relationship with the world. It will enhance cordial relations and common understanding, which will lead to economic partnership, including an exchange of views regarding society, the arts and culture, technology and the environment for the mutual benefit of the two nations. Thaksin was expected to meet with French President Jacques Chirac and Francis Mer, France's minister of economy, finance and industry, during the visit. Bilateral trade between France and Thailand fell 17 per cent last year to 2.23 billion euros, with Thai exports to France totaling 771 million euros and French exports to Thailand 1.46 billion euros. The Thai government hopes the Thailand Festival, which is scheduled to be held in Paris in 2004 and 2005, will create stronger tourism and cultural ties between the two countries. Cooperation in the tourism industry between France and Thailand is expected to be boosted after the ongoing visit to the key European country of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his entourage, as the two countries are likely to set up a joint committee on tourism promotion, according to Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak. The visit to France is the first by a Thai prime minister since the late Chatichai Choonhavan went there 14 years before. In October 2005, French President Jacques Chirac told the Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra that he wanted to increase trade between their countries, and called Thailand a strategic country in Asia. Trade between France and Thailand rose by 11 percent in 2004, and was up 32 percent in the first half of 2005. France considers Thailand "a key country" on that continent, and hopes to develop partnerships with Thailand, particularly in the fields of high technology, energy, defense, security and infrastructure. The two men also discussed France's aid to Thailand following the December's tsunami. French tsunami aid to Thailand is estimated at 6 million Euros (US$7.3 million), including 5 million Euros (US$6 million) issued through the French Red Cross. In February 2006, after meeting with his French counterpart Philip Doust Plazy, Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon said that the two countries hope to increase their bilateral trade value by $5US billion (EUR 4.2 billion) over the next three years, with France promising to invest more in the Thai kingdom. The Thai foreign minister said France also expressed its interest in extending aid to development projects in Thailand's neighboring countries, in particular the Thai-Laos-Vientiane Railway Project. The two nations will also hold a foreign ministerial meeting annually to further strengthen relations. Thailand and France have also agreed to double the number of tourist arrivals in the other country over the next three years. Thailand and France have also agreed to expand bilateral cooperation in national defense and security. The agreement was reached at a meeting here Saturday between Thai Defense Minister Gen. Thammarak Isarangura Na Ayutthaya and his French counterpart Michele Alliot-Marie. French President Jacques Chirac's visit to Thailand gives France increased regional influence and grants Thailand access to commercial and diplomatic spheres outside of Asia. Chirac, who wrapped up the first trip to Thailand by a French President, spoke with Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra on a range of issues. But he pushed a commercial agenda that he hopes will counter the influence of other foreign countries. Key to this is France's involvement in Thailand's massive 44-billion-dollar public works program, with French companies vying for lucrative transit, water and defense contracts. Both publicly, and in private discussions with key Thai officials, Chirac and his delegation pitched French firms for the project, with the president saying he would like to see "French entrepreneurs become among the preferred partners of the Thai authorities". Chirac brought with him 30 top French business leaders, including those from Airbus, engineering conglomerate Alstom and retail giant Carrefour, as both sides agreed to work towards boosting two-way annual trade to five billion dollars and investments to two billion dollars. France is Thailand's third-biggest European investor after Britain and Germany, and bilateral trade rose 37 percent year-on-year to 3.3 billion dollars in 2005. Chirac called Thailand a "privileged partner" of France, which could be the kingdom's gateway to Europe, and the French are giving "very serious" consideration to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai's bid to succeed UN chief Kofi Annan.
