TERRMID: MID3181 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler 2018, Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente, but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force to prevent Austria from joining Germany or the Little Entente. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because no states were disputing territory here, although Austria was intending to voluntarily unify with another country (other countries) to solve its economic crisis. Romania is pulled in because it is a member of the Little Entente and was therefore partly the subject of a threat made by Italy about Austria's possible unification with other states.
