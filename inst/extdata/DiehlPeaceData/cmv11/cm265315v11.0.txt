TERRMID-NOTES: MID346 from Gibler (2018), Czechoslovakia threatened to walk out of the World Communist meeting in Budapest in 1968 if Russia did not stop interfering in Czech international affairs. Czechoslovakia's leader had been embracing a more international position, which worried communists in the Soviet Union and in other Soviet-controlled/allied states. The Soviets had been supporting the opposition political party in Czechoslovakia who held a more hard-line, pro-Soviet stance. In June 1968, the opposition party lost in the parliamentary elections, and Soviet tanks arrived in Czechoslovakia and soon thereafter detained the Czech leader. The tanks travelled through East Germany and Poland, who were supporting USSR in this dispute, bringing East Germany and Poland into this MID. In November, the Soviets forced Czechoslovakia to reorganize their regime and become more closely aligned with Soviet communism. Coded not territory because althuogh this MID involved Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, this was a regime type issue, not a territorial issue, as the Soviets were ensuring a friendly regime remained in place.

The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, an economic alliance was established at an economic conference in Moscow, on January 5, 1949. Czechoslovakia was a founding member, while East Germany joined in 1950. This organization aimed to increase economic cooperation and technological transfer between its members. 
The Warsaw Pact, a military alliance between the Eastern European Communist states, including Czechoslovakia and East Germany, was established on May 14, 1955. The members pledged mutual defense in case a member was attacked.

On October 16, 1965, war games between Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia occurred in East Germany, close to the border with West Germany. 

On March 18, 1967, East Germany and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty of friendship.

This is the military invasion of Czechoslovakia by most of the Warsaw Pact countries (Romania did not join), including East Germany. Given that East German troops did not invade and that there were numerous protests within East Germany regarding Soviet Union's policy to invade Czechoslovakia, this rivalry seems to be more of an indirect rivalry due to the Warsaw Pact vs. Czechoslovakia conflict.

On January 14, 1972, East Germany opened its borders with Czechoslovakia to allow free movement of people across the two Communist countries. The citizens of each country can cross in the other country with a regular ID, without needing passports, visas, or other documents. 

Hundreds of East Germans fled to Czechoslovakia on November 1, 1989, after the government lifted travel restrictions, and a top Communist official for the first time said the future of the Berlin Wall could be open to discussion.

East Germany today lifted restrictions that had barred most travel to Czechoslovakia since Oct. 3. Former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker imposed the ban to stem the flow of thousands of refugees fleeing West through West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

New party leader Egon Krenz rescinded the ban and has also hinted that a new law giving East Germans greater travel freedom would be studied. Czechoslovakia is the only country East Germans can visit without permission.
