MID3360:

TERRMID: MID3360 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID3360 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3360 per the PS_NARRATIVE, both states became independent following the 1954 Geneva Conference, and the border was defined along the 17th parallel. However, both countries continued to coerce the other ideologically and, at times, with force. MID3360 occurred on November 8, 1960, when South Vietnam officially accused North Vietnam of sending troops into the South Vietnamese village of Kontum to engage South forces there. The attack was repelled. MID3360 occurred during a brief interwar period, and the wars (First and Second Indochina Wars) involved North Vietnam attempting to control the entirety of the South's territory. Because the peace was never stable, MID3360 is coded territorial. The continued interference with each other suggests that neither side considered the territorial issue resolved.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3360 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3360 this MID occurred before the Second Indochina War, popularly known as the Vietnam War, began. These wars had both interstate and civil war aspects. The civil war aspect comes from the North's attempts to use communist guerrillas within South Vietnam to topple that government and bring the entire territory under its control. Coded civil war MID because N Vietnam was supporting communist guerrillas in the South to overthrow the South Vietnamese government.

TERRMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTES: MID611 is the Vietnam War, or Second Indochina War. The war was an attempt to unify Vietnam under one government; thus, because the North was attempting to take control of the entirety of the South's territory, coded as territorial MID. Resulted in the North controlling all of Vietnam.

TERRLINK-NOTES: 

MARITMID: MID611 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
MARITMID-NOTES: MID611 the Vietnam War was fought for control of all of Vietnam's territory, including maritime possessions and control over islands in the Spratly archipelago. Also, warfare did occur in the sea between North and South Vietnam.

ISLMID: MID611 1 -- islands MID
ISLMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID611 the Vietnam War included a fight for control over islands in the Spratly archipelago. When the North defeated the South in 1975, it took control of the islands that had until then been held by South Vietnam (Cordner 1994; see "817840 MID3217 maritime and Spratly islands claims . Cordner 1994.pdf‚Äù file in MID Documentation). Although the uninhabitable islands were certainly not the focus of the war, they were considered part of South Vietnam and was therefore part of the North's attempt to control all of Vietnam. 

CIVWARMID: MID611 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID611 the Vietnam war had both interstate and civil war aspects. The civil war aspect comes from N Vietnam funding, arming, etc communist guerrillas in S Vietnam trying to overthrow the government. Coded Civil War MID because S Vietnam was fighting a civil war against communist guerrillas assisted by N Vietnam in its territory. 

CIVWARLINK: MID611 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID611 coded civil war link because MID611 is a multilateral MID, and in other dyad(s) it is considered a CIVWARMID. Also a civil war MID in Cambodia-N Vietnam.

NARRATIVE-CM:
MID3360 occurred on November 8, 1960. On November 8, 1960, the government of South Vietnam leveled a charge of direct aggression against Communist North Vietnam. In an indictment of its northern neighbor, for the first time since the end of the Indochina war in 1954, S. Vietnam accused N. Vietnam of sending troops via Laos to fight S. Vietnamese troops in the area of Kontum, in S. Vietnamese territory. S. Vietnamese troops were reported to have driven back the Communist offensive. 

On October 24, 1961, South Vietnam lodged formal charges of aggression against North Vietnam with the International Control Commission. The South Vietnamese complaint was accompanied by a large collection of photographic and documentary evidence of intervention in the south by men and units from N. Vietnam, as alleged by S. Vietnam. 

On May 25, 1962, Canadian and Indian officials from the International Control Commission have found Communist North Vietnam guilty of subversion and covert aggression against South Vietnam. On July 19, 1963, Communist North Korea suggested a ceasefire could be reached in the guerilla war in the South if the S. Vietnamese government ousts US advisers and takes in Communists in its government.

North Vietnam entered the international system on July 21, 1954. In 1954 both states became independent under the Geneva Conference. At that conference the division of the country along the 17th parallel was decided. On June 12, 1957, North Vietnam accused South Vietnam of breaking the 1954 Geneva accords with respect to the number of military personnel allowed on each side. On July 20, 1957, Pam Van Dong, North Vietnam's premier made a suggestion to S. Vietnam to open talks about re-unification. This was the third time in 3 years such a proposal was put on the table by North Vietnam. South Vietnam has always rejected these proposals on the grounds that free elections will not be possible in North Vietnam. On December 26, 1958 North Vietnam asked South Vietnam to a parley. N. Vietnam suggested meetings between the officials of both countries as well as a reduction in the number of military personnel on both sides.

The ideological differences as well as the fighting between the two states that occurred during the First Indochina War, when the South fought together with France against Ho Chi Minh's north make these post-independence years a difficult relationship. Both states tried to influence each other and promote their Communist or democratic ideology onto the other.
