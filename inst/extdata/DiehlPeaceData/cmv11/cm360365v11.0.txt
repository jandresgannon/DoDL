CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2365 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this is likely the Allies' intervention in the Russian Civil War. This is coded civil war MID because this is connected to the civil war in Russia (within dyad), but coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped due to a lack of compelling evidence to show what this MID is about.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1718 from Gibler 2018, Romania noticed that China and the USSR became distant and began strengthening its own ties with China. The USSR took this as an insult and coordinated military exercises with Hungary and Czechoslovakia along Romania's border. Tensions died down soon thereafter. Coded not territory because no territory was being disputed. This was an attempt to deter strengthening diplomatic ties between Romania and China.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Romania and Russia disputed the sovereignty of Bessarabia (Moldavia) beginning in 1918. Russia severed diplomatic relations with Romania after Romanian troops occupied Kishinev, capital of Bessarabia, on January 13, 1918. Russia demanded the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Bessarabia, and Romania agreed to withdraw its troops from Bessarabia on March 9, 1918. Bessarabia voted to unite with Romania on April 9, 1918, and Russia protested the union on April 23, 1918. The *Central Powers *(Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire) formally recognized the Bessarabia-Romanian union with the signing of the *Treaty of Bucharest *on May 7, 1918. The National Council of Bessarabia voted to join Romania on November 27, 1918, and Romania formally united with Bessarabia on April 20, 1919. Romanian troops clashed with Russian Bolshevik troops near the Dniester River on March 24, 1919. Russia demanded the withdrawal of Romania troops from Bessarabia within 48 hours on May 1, 1919, and Russia declared a state-of-war against Romania on May 18, 1919. Romanian and Russian representatives formally signed a ceasefire agreement on March 2, 1920. Romania and the Allied countries (Britain, France, Italy, and Japan) signed an agreement in Paris on October 28, 1920, which provided for Allied recognition of Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia. Romanian and Russian representative held negotiations concerning the resumption of diplomatic relations in Vienna on March 23-April 2, 1924, but the parties disputed the sovereignty of Bessarabia.

Some 900,000 Soviet troops launched a military offensive against Romania on August 20, 1944, and Soviet troops occupied Bucharest on August 31, 1944. Some 360,000 German troops and 450,000 Romanian troops opposed the Soviet invasion. Some 60,000 German soldiers, 69,000 Soviet soldiers, and 130,000 Romanian soldiers were killed during the conflict. Soviet troops took control of northern Transylvania (which was ceded by Romania to Hungary on August 30, 1940) on November 13, 1944. The Soviet Union returned control of northern Transylvania to Romania on March 10, 1945. Britain, France, and the United States agreed to allow the Soviet Union to retain northern Bukovina and Bessarabia on June 14, 1946.
