TERRMID-NOTES: MID315 from Gibler (2018), a German gunboat arrived in Morocco, where France was establishing a colony. France interpreted this as Germany attempting to establish a German colony. The UK became involved in this MID by warning Germany not to expand into Morocco (the UK and France were new allies). Eventually, Germany conceded Morocco to France in exchange for part of the French Congo holdings. Coded territorial MID because this was a dispute over colonial territory in Africa.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID211 from Gibler (2018), France and Belgium threatened to invade and deny German access to the Ruhr, a resource-rich part of Germany, due to Germany's default on reparation payments. France and Belgium responded to German troop deployments in the Ruhr with their own troop deployments. Coded not territory because neither France nor Belgium claimed Ruhn as their own. France and Belgium occupied the Ruhr in an attempt to exert economic pressure on Germany.

TERRMID-CER: MID127 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID127 from Gibler (2018), the Allied Powers were demanding reparations from Germany after WWI, and Germany was trying to negotiate better terms. In 1921, France and Belgium invaded the Ruhr to prevent Germany from extracting resources there. Belgium joined the French in using troop deployments to provide economic pressure on Germany into making reparation payments. Coded not territory because neither France nor Belgium claimed the Ruhr as their own, and they occupied the Ruhr to exert economic pressure on Germany.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID127 from Gibler (2018), this is another incidence of France and Belgium issuing threats to Germany after Germany defaulted on reparations payments. Here, in 1922, France and Belgium warned Germany they would occupy the Ruhr if Germany did not start making payments, and they eventually occupied Ruhr (to some extent). Coded not territory because neither France nor Belgium were claiming Ruhr as their own, and the occupation was to coerce reparations payments.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID12 from Gibler (2018), Germany pressed a claim on Sudetenland, an area of former German control that had been under Czech control since the end of WWI. Germany issued a series of demands to Czechoslovakia, and other Allied Powers, most importantly UK and France, did not offer much support against Germany. The Czech military mobilized in preparation for a German invasion. Eventually UK and France forced Czechoslovakia to surrender part of its territory to Germany. Coded third party link to territorial MID because France became involved in this territorial dispute between Germany and Czechoslovakia.

NARRATIVE-CM:
France and Germany developed rival colonial interests in Morocco after Kaiser Wilhelm II's visit to Morocco on March 31, 1905, during which he indicated that Germany had "great and growing interests in Morocco." European powers convened the *Algeciras Conference* from January 16 to April 7, 1906, which resolved the crisis between the countries. French police arrested three German nationals, who had deserted from the French Foreign Legion, as they were attempting to board a German steamship in Casablanca on September 25, 1908. Germany protested the arrests and argued that the individuals were under its protection and jurisdiction. France and Germany submitted the dispute concerning the German deserters to the *Permanent Court of Arbitration* (PCA) on November 24, 1908. The PCA issued a decision in favor of France on May 22, 1909. The German cruiser *Panther* appeared off the coast of Agadir, Morocco in July 1911. Britain's support for France in this incident caused Germany to back down. France and Germany signed treaties on November 3-4, 1911 which ended the crisis and resolved the dispute over Morocco. A dispute emerged between the countries after three German deserters from the French foreign legion were taken by force from a German consular official in Casablanca. Germany and France agreed to submit the dispute to an arbitration board, which issued a report on May 22, 1909. Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarejevo. French troops and German troops engaged in military hostilities in Alsace and Lorraine from August 14 to August 25, 1914, when French troops were driven back to Verdun. German troops launched a military offensive against French troops commanded by General Henri Philippe Petain in Verdun on February 21, 1916, but the military offensive ended on December 18, 1916. Some 162,308 French soldiers were killed during the battle for Verdun. Some 800,000 French troops commanded by General Robert Nivelle launched a military offensive against German troops in the Aisne region on April 16, 1917, but the military offensive ended on May 9, 1917. Some 187,000 French soldiers were killed or wounded in the battle, and some 133,000 German soldiers were killed or wounded. Germany agreed to a cessation of military hostilities with the Allied countries on November 11, 1918. French and German representatives signed the *Treaty of Versailles* on June 29, 1919, which provided for LON administration of the Saar region in western Germany for a period of fifteen years. The LON Council established the five-member *Saar Bason Governing Commission *(SBGC), which consisted of representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, and Germany headed by Victor Raoult of France, to administer the Saar region on February 13, 1920. German troops entered the Ruhr district to suppress rebellions on April 3, 1920, and France responded by occupying Frankfurt and Darmstadt on April 6, 1920. Belgium deployed troops in Frankfurt and Darmstadt in support of France. Britain condemned France on April 8, 1920. On April 24, 1920, Germany announced that it would withdraw its troops from the Ruhr, and France agreed to withdraw its troops from German territory on April 26, 1920. France and Belgium completed the withdrawal of troops from Germany on May 18, 1920. On March 8, 1921, French troops occupied Duisburg, Ruhrort, and Dusseldorf in the Ruhr district as a result of a dispute concerning reparation payments. Germany referred the matter to the *League of Nations* (LON) Council on March 10, 1921. On January 11, 1923, French troops occupied the Ruhr district after German delays in paying reparations. Germany suspended reparation payments and called upon its officials to refuse to cooperate with the French. Some 800 French, Belgian, and British troops were deployed in the Saar to guard the railways in 1927. In January 1934, the LON Council established a three-member plebiscite commission (Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland) to organize, administer, and supervise a plebiscite in the Saar region. The plebiscite commission was assisted by 950 staff personnel from Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Switzerland. On September 8, 1934, the LON Council established a plebiscite tribunal consisting of twenty judges from Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland headed by Bindo Galli of Italy. The LON Council established a peacekeeping force for the Saar region on December 8, 1934. The LON peacekeeping force consisted of 1,500 British troops, 1,300 Italian troops, 250 Dutch troops, and 250 Swedish troops commanded by Major-General J. E. S. Brind of Britain. Ninety percent of voters in the Saar region chose to rejoin Germany in a plebiscite held on January 13, 1935. The LON peacekeeping force was withdrawn from the Saar region on February 28, 1935, and the Saar region was returned to Germany on March 1, 1935. German troops entered the Rhineland on March 7, 1936. France referred the matter to the LON Council on March 8, 1936. The LON Council condemned Germany on March 13, 1936. Following the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, France declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939. France capitulated to German troops on June 22, 1940. The *Free French National Council* (FFNC), formed in exile on September 23, 1941, declared war on Germany on December 8, 1941. Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allied countries on May 8, 1945. Some 250,000 French soldiers and 360,000 French civilians were killed during the conflict. The *Western European Union* (WEU) Council agreed to temporarily administer the Saar region beginning on May 11, 1955. Some 68 percent of Saar residents voted against the statute in a referendum on October 23, 1955. The WEU established a five-member commission (Belgium, Britian, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands) headed by Fernand Delhousse of Belgium to supervise the referendum.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The first rivalry between France and Germany began during Belgium's bid for independence (MID370) in 1830. Belgium sought independence from the Dutch which involved the Great Powers. France following the overthrow of the Bourbons (1830) took a policy of support for a independent Belgium, which France considered French by right (Thomas 1983). Frederick William III (head of Prussia) was tied to the Dutch interest of retaining Belgium because his brother-in-law was head of Holland. Prussia restrained itself wanting to avoid a European war. Britain, France and Russia all held interest in the outcome and therefore a conference was called to settle the issue of Belgium's independence.

The conference of London was held and a treaty drafted that would give Belgium independence and specified territorial issues. William III stated assured France that Prussia would remain uninvolved as long as French troops did not approach the Rhine (Nov 4, 1830). In September of 1832 Prussia led forces against the Belgian's in Antwerp (MID368). The Belgians were attempting to drive out the Dutch. France sent an army in response to put down the constant Dutch threat to Peace (Thomas 1983). A treaty was signed in May of 1833 that was accepted by both Holland and Belgium, which reiterated the terms set forth during the Conference of London. 

France began to take a much more aggressive anti-Prussian stance because of the belief that France was falling behind other European countries abroad. France began to actively support pro-French movements in Poland and Italy as well as fortifying forces in colonial holdings (Tombs 1996). France lent support to the pro-French prasha of Egypt, Mohammed Ali in 1940. The European Alliance fell apart over French Aggression in Egypt (MID217).

In 1859 the Bonapartist French government led by Napoleon III entered Italy to resolve the problem of a Austria military presence (MID115). Prussia mobilized its military to enforce a ceasefire between France, Austria and Italy. A ceasefire was negotiated and the Kingdom of Italy was established in 1860. France gained the territories of Nice and Savoy (Tombs 1996). Prussia in an alliance with the new Italian government forced a conflict with Austria in 1866 (MID509). France momentarily entered the fight in an attempt to gain control over the Rhine but was limited by a weak army and divided attention. 

A increasingly aggressive France mounted a campaign with the intent of marching into Berlin in 1870 (MID88). The French army was beat back and defeated in Sudan by the Prussian army. 130,000 French soldiers were taken captive. French forces continued to resist the now invading Prussian army for several months (MID2169) but finally a revolution in Paris forced surrender in March of 1871 (Tombs 1996). Germany demanded Alsace and part of Lorraine as well as monetary compensation from France. The treaty of Frankfurt (May 10) granted Germany all of their requests (MID2168). French elections occurred in June restoring the monarchy and giving the thrown to a Bourbon, Comte de Chambord. 

In 1885 new elections brought Boulanger into power as minister of war. Boulanger was an anti-German who Bismark viewed as a threat to Germany (Tombs). Germany took an active stance against the new government and captured a spy in 1887 (MID2369). The same year Germany demanded that Boulanger be removed (MID2368). A new election ousted Boulanger but he gained support among the public and was elected as head of state in a later election. 

The final resolution to the longstanding issues over the Ruhr, the Saar mines, the Rhineland and German military strength wouldn't come about until Germany's defeat in the Second World War. A 20th century rivalry between France and Germany was initiated with the Moroccan Crisis of 1911 (MID315). In May of 1911 the French sent in forces to Occupy the Moroccan city of Fez in order to re-establish order after a rebellion (www.onwar.com 2003). Kaiser Wilhelm (Germany) protested and claimed that France was attempted to establish a protectorate empire. Wilhelm dispatched a gunboat to deal with French forces. Resolution came with France agreeing to financially compensate Germany for establishing a protectorate in Morocco. Germany also received several areas in the French Congo as well. 

German military expansionism clashed with French and British interests in 1914 with the start of the First World War (MID257). With the defeat of Germany in 1918 came a negotiated Armistice on November 11th. Germany had to clear Belgium, France and Alsace-Loraine of all forces, surrender its military hardware, evacuate the Rhine region, surrender much of its rail system, endure Allied occupation troops and surrender its navy (Grenville 1980). Following the Armistice the Treaty of Versailles was negotiated which specified German reparations to France. Versailles (June 18th, 1919) upheld the conditions of the Armistice as well as adding monetary reparations to the Allies and prevention of any sizable military and almost no navy. In addition to monetary reparations, Germany was to deliver most of its coal production to France (this both ensured French recovery and would prevent a swift recovery of Germany). These issues would be revisited following WWII. 

Following the defeat of Germany, France insisted that Germany's recovery from the war should not be an easy one and therefore Germany should not have access to the resources of the Ruhr which would allow rapid reconstruction (Thomas p498). The loss of the steel was a crippling blow to the staggering German economy. In April of 1920 the Weimar government moved troops into the Ruhr to secure access. France in return also deployed troops (MID211 The First Occupation of the Ruhr). Britain, France and Belgium issued sanctions against Germany and troops were removed. 

The second occupation of the Ruhr (MID127) began in March of 1921 as France returned troops to the region and left an occupying force to ensure continued German reparations. In 1923 France again sent in troops (MID177), however it was unilateral this time, in an attempt to force Germany repayment of war debts (Schmidt p47). France claimed that Germany had not met the terms of the London schedule of payments and therefore was subject to sanctions (Schmidt p50). France and Belgium took over the operation of Germany railways, forcing Germany to abandon its resistance to the French occupation of Ruhr. Because of a failing economy Germany met France's demands and stopped disputing the Ruhr for over a decade.

The ending period for the last conflict between France and Germany/Prussia is dated May 7th, 1945 (MID258 WWII). May 7th was the day that the Germany forces surrendered to the Allied forces and the day that Soviet troops entered Berlin. Also, this date corresponds with the return of approximately 2 million prisoners of war held in Germany to the French government. France was under German control since June of 1940 when German troops had entered Paris until the Allied liberation of France in June of 1944 (Grenville 1980). Once liberated, Charles de Gaulle was placed in charge of the provisional government. Charles de Gaulle was the head of State for France until January of 1946 at which point he resigned until returning as head of state 12 years later. (Palgrave 2002; also see Gordon 1998). Hitler was head of state for Germany for the duration of the World War II, but died before the official surrender of Germany. 

Charles de Gaulle became the official voice of France in October of 1944. However, even before he became the leader for a free France, de Gaulle had been continuing negotiations with the Allied powers since 1940 (Gordon 1998). After taking his place as head of state he wasted no time advancing the needs and demands of the French people. After the last of the German forces surrendered in May of 1945, France prepared its list of demands for German reparations. However, France had not invited to the Yalta conference of February 11, 1945 in which previsions for German surrender and reparations had been laid out (Palgrave 2002; also see Grenville 1980). Despite being left out of the Yalta conference de Gaulle had been making France's hopes for a post-war settlement known. In January of 1945 he had met with the soviet head of state, Stalin for a discussion of the post-war order. The meeting with Stalin resolved none of France's demands but did provide a pact of mutual assistance in the event of future German aggressions (Thomas 1998; also see Grenville 1980).
France's demands were several fold:
1) France demanded a prisoner return
2) France wanted the Saar mines and surrounding territory returned 
3) France demanded that the Ruhr be made independent of any future central German government and that it be subject to international control
4) France wanted the Rhineland to be separated from German control and desired it be occupied by an Allied force
5) Lastly, France wanted Germany to be permanently hindered from every remilitarizing

The Potsdam conference of August 2nd, 1945 was held to determine what reparations Germany needed to make. Although detailed reparations were included for the USSR, the only reparation afforded France was the occupation of Western Germany in addition to West Berlin (Grenville et al. 1987). The other Allied powers did not seem to share de Gaulle's view on justice for France and Stalin was noted for having said that the French fought so poorly during the war they should receive nothing at all (Kennedy-Pipe 1998). Charles de Gaulle had little luck altering opinion and the treaty drafted at Potsdam reflected that failure. 

French demands did undergo revision as the likelihood of achieving them seemed more and more distant and de Gaulle resigned and was replaced by the socialist Felix Gouin. Having had the first demand met France concentrated on its concerns for the Ruhr and the steel production capabilities that came with it. On March 24th of 1946 France in an effort to gain British favor signed a mutual assistance pact similar to that with the Soviet Union. However, France's hopes for demands 2 and 4 were crushed with the Allied proposal of a four-part division of Germany. There would be no need to deprive Germany of these resources if it were to remain divided and occupied (Grenville 1980). 

With the fear of a possibly aggressive Germany gone, France returned the German territory that it occupied to Germany in 1949. The French concern over access to the German steel production in the disputed territories was settled in 1951 when the Schumann plan led to the creation of a Franco-German iron and steel production authority (not meeting the demand of control over the Ruhr [3] but compensating for it). By the 18th of April 1951 the European Coal and Steel Community was formed to regulate the use of steel for purely commercial, non-military purposes (Grenville 1980). This brought to an end the concerns of reparations that France had expressed prior to the end of the MID. This provides an appropriate time to end the dispute since it corresponds with closure on all of the issues France was concerned with. Ending the dispute any earlier would leave out the conflict between Germany and France concerning coalmine access and ending any later would incorporate issues related to the Cold War and not to WWII.

PS-NARRATIVE:

19450507-19570323 Transition

The last MID of RIV10531, MID258 ended on June 22, 1940 when France's participation ended. In the period immediately following World War II, there is a period of transition for Germany as it consolidates its sovereignty into two states and undergoes a period of formal occupation by the Allied powers. Thus, the period from the end of the German participation in World War II (19450507) until the re-emergence of West Germany as a sovereign state and its entry into the European Economic Community (19570324) is a period of transition, which is coded as a transition. 

Germany was occupied by the Allied powers the US, USSR, UK, and France and subsequently divided into 'East' (GDR) and 'West' (GFR) Germany. The 1954 Protocol on the end of German occupation was ratified, and in 1955 the Federal republic of Germany was recognized as independent and sovereign. Germany (country code 255) drops out of the Correlates of War country list in 1945 and the German Federal Republic (country code 260) does not appear until May 5, 1955 while the German Democratic Republic (country code 265) appears in 1954.

Issues that motivated the rivalry at its conclusion included: Western border of Germany, especially control over Alsace-Lorraine, Saar regions; German influence in central Europe. By curtailing German power and setting up a division of Europe, WWII substantially settled the question of how much influence Germany would have in central Europe. 

A key issue in the resolution of issues motivating the rivalry was the Western border of Germany. At the close of the war, France returned the German territory that it occupied to Germany in 1949. Saarland was also a central concern of the issue of the Franco-German border. 

Saarland was established as an internationally controlled territory in 1920 in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles under the control of the League of Nations. It was in practice administered by France for 15 years, very much against the wishes of almost all Germans both inside and outside the territory. After World War II the Saarland came under French administration again, as the Saar Protectorate. In 1954, France and the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) developed a detailed plan, called the Saarstatut, to establish an independent Saarland, but a plebiscite rejected this plan by 67.7%. On October 27, 1956, the Saar Treaty established that Saarland should be allowed to rejoin the Federal Republic of Germany, which it did on January 1, 1957. 

There are multiple efforts towards integration that take place subsequent to World War II. In 1948 the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was founded, excluding Germany, and the 1948 Brussels treaty joined Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in a military alliance directed against any aggressor. In 1948 those same countries agreed on steps to lead to the creation of a new West German constitution, and in 1949 the first government of the Federal Republic of Germany was formed, and became a full member of the OEEC. 

In 1951 the European Coal and Steel Community marked renewed economic cooperation between Germany and France. There were six founding members in total: Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg (the Benelux countries) and West Germany, France and Italy. Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, in an effort towards preventing another European war. The initial plan was developed by a French civil servant Jean Monnet, and was publicized by the French foreign minister Robert Schuman. On May 9, 1950, Schuman presented his proposal on the creation of an organized Europe stating that it was indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations. This proposal, known as the "Schuman declaration,'' is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union. The ECSC was established by the Treaty of Paris, signed in April 1951, and taking effect in July 1952.

After the war the desire for a European union greatly increased, driven by the determination to rebuild Europe and to eliminate the possibility of another war. This sentiment eventually led to the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community by (West) Germany, France, Italy and the Benelux countries. This was accomplished by the Treaty of Paris, signed in April, 1951, and taking effect in July, 1952.

The first full customs union was originally known as the European Economic Community (informally called the Common Market in the UK), established by the Treaty of Rome signed in March 1957 and implemented on 1 January 1958. This later changed to the European Community which is now the "first pillar" of the European Union. 

In the security realm, the North Atlantic Treaty is signed in Washington, DC on April 4, 1949 as an international organisation for defense collaboration. The treaty avoids reference both to the identification of an enemy and to any concrete measures of common defense. Nevertheless, it was intended so that if the USSR and its allies launched an attack against any of the NATO members, it would be treated as if it was an attack on all member states. On May 14, 1955: Warsaw Pact treaty is signed in Warsaw by the Soviet Union and its satellite states (including East Germany) as a formal response to NATO's incorporation of West Germany in 1955. 

As military allies in NATO, and economic partners through the various European Communities and institutions, France and Germany were slowly integrating themselves into a European-based organization.

The Maastricht Treaty forming the European Union was signed by the members of the European Communities on February 7, 1992 and entered into force on November 1, 1993. The Maastricht Treaty represents a first step in highest form of integration between sovereign countries in the international system. The Treaty of Amsterdam (1997), Treaty of Nice (2001) and the Lisbon Treaty (2007)deepened the integration process between France and Germany, and all the other members of the European Union.

SB-CR:
France / Prussia (Germany, Federal Republic of Germany) Years: 1850-1955. Issues at stake: Western border of Germany, especially control over Alsace-Lorraine, Saar regions; German influence in central Europe; before WWI, borders between French and German colonies in Africa (Togo). End coding: In 1954 Britain, France, the United States, and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a Protocol on the end of the occupation regime in western Germany, which went into effect in 1955. This recognized the Federal Republic of Germany as an independent, sovereign state, with western borders as set in 1945 (at Yalta and Potsdam) with minor adjustments made in 1949 in favor of Belgium and the Netherlands. In 1955 a plebiscite was held in the Saar, resulting in its 1957 return to the Federal Republic of Germany. France accepted these results, settling the last remaining border issue. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 15. Last militarized dispute: 1945. Wars: 1870-1871, 1914-1918, 1939-1940, 1944-1945. Summary: The French-Prussian rivalry started with the beginning of processes leading to German Unification. The Prussian Customs Union (starting 1828) and German customs union (Zolverein, starting 1834) led by Prussia had begun the economic unification of Germany. German expansionist efforts resulted in war with Denmark in 1850 (French actions relating to the war marks France's heightened interest in the potential German expansion). By 1866, following war with Austria, Prussia annexed Schleswig, Holstein, and Hanover (the source of dispute with Denmark). Unification was formalize in the settlement following the 1870-1871 war between Prussia and France, with Alsace-Lorraine (formerly French) part of the new Germany. Disputes continued through the late 1800s with disputes over colonial territory. The 1st and 2nd Moroccan crises represented attempts by Germany to limit French influence, which were only partly successful, and set the stage for WWI. France received Alsace-Lorraine back in the post-WWI peace settlement, and gained administrative control over the Saar. Germany also lost its colonial empire as part of the peace settlement. Germany protested the settlement immediately; militarized disputes occurred soon after, in 1920, 1921, and 1923, when in each case the WWI allies occupied parts of the Ruhr valley in an attempt to ensure German payment of reparations. On March 1, 1935, the Saar was returned to Germany after a plebiscite in January. Later in March Germany reintroduced general conscription, and in 1936 it remilitarized the Rhineland, representing the next "heating up" of the rivalry. A complete peace settlement with Germany was not reached immediately following the end of WWII, but took place after a number of intermediate steps. By curtailing German power and setting up a division of Europe, WWII substantially settled the question of how much influence Germany would have in central Europe. In 1948 the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was founded, excluding Germany, and the 1948 Brussels treaty joined Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg in a military alliance directed against any aggressor. However, in 1948 those same countries agreed on steps to lead to the creation of a new West German constitution, and in 1949 the first government of the Federal Republic of Germany ("supervised democracy" Grenville 1974:274) was formed, and became a full member of the OEEC. In 1951 the European Coal and Steel Community marked renewed economic cooperation between Germany and France, and the 1952 European Defense Community linked West Germany militarily with the rest of Western Europe. The 1952 Bonn Agreement to end allied occupation of Germany was not ratified because the French government could not obtain a parliamentary majority to support it; the 1954 Protocol on the end of German occupation was ratified, and in 1955 the Federal republic of Germany was recognized as independent and sovereign. Notes: The Federal Republic of Germany inherits the territorial dispute between France and Germany after WWII.
