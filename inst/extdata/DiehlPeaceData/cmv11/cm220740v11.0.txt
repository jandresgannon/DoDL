TERRMID-NOTES: MID337 from Gibler 2018, this MID began in the lead-up to WWII and lasted through the first year of the war. Anglo-Japanese relations were deteriorating, and after the British refused to hand over 4 Chinese citizens accused of assassinating a Japanese customs inspector to Japan, Japan blockaded French and British concessions in Tientsin. Later, Japan blockaded German exportd and Japan threatened Britain, contributing to this MID. Britain then seized a German ship which included Japanese sailors. Coded not territory because this was not connected to any disputed territory but was rather a series of events connected to WWII-era tensions (Allies vs. Axis powers). Although WWII did involve some territorial disputes, no territory was being disputed in this specific MID.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The opening three mids in the rivalry between France and Japan had to do with resistance to Western influence and contact. 

It is during this period (1863-4) that the US and Japan engaged in their first militarized conflict: MID13 and MID239. On July 16, 1863 the USS Wyoming retaliated against a firing on the American vessel Pembroke at Shimonoseki (MID13). From July 14 through August 3, 1864 naval forces protected the United States Minister to Japan when he visited Yedo to negotiate concerning some American claims against Japan, and to make his negotiations easier by impressing the Japanese with American power. MID239 occurred in September of 1864 (4-14). Naval forces of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands compelled Japan and the Prince of Nagato in particular to permit the Straits of Shimonoseki to be used by foreign shipping in accordance with treaties already signed. A similar incident occurred in November of 1865. This was MID224. Here the French, British and Dutch compelled Japan to abide by the terms of the treaty of Shimoneseki. 

The Japanese have been concerned with Korea throughout their history. They have called it the dagger pointed at the heart of Japan. It was over Korea that the Japanese fought in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894-5. The subsequent mid between a number of Western states and Japan had to do with the treaty settling that conflict. 

MID106 or the `Aftermath of Sino-Japanese War' occurred (for the French) on April 23, 1895. Here the French protested and threatened force over a clause in the treaty settling the war in which the Chinese ceded territory on the Chinese mainland to Japan. 

Japan invaded Inner (Chinese) Manchuria in 1931 and set up the puppet state of Manchukuo under the last Manchu emperor, Pu Yi. In 1933, Japan resigned from the League of Nations. The Japanese invasion of China in 1937 (the second Sino-Japanese War) followed Japan's signing of the "anti-Comintern pact" with Nazi Germany the previous year. The mids between France and Japan are related to the Japanese expansion of influence on mainland China up to World War II. 

MID337 occurred from December of 1938 until June of 1940. Here the Japanese blockaded international settlements in China in Tienstin. Japan imposed barrier restrictions on the French and British concession of Tientsin. Japanese official media began an anti-British propaganda campaign in occupied China in March 1939. On May 24, 1939 the Japanese foreign Ministry issued a statement threatening the treaty rights of the European powers. On June 14, 1939 Japan began a full blockade of the British and French concessions in Tientsin. During the period from June 19 - 23, 1939, Japanese military forces stopped and searched all British and French citizens attempting to leave Tientsin. Japan ended the blockade of Tientsin on June 20, 1940. 

MID258 is World War II. Japanese troops invaded French Indochina on September 22, 1940. Japan occupied and controlled French Indochina beginning in June 1940. The Japanese left the colonial administration largely intact. Japan surrendered unconditionally on August 14, 1945. In 1945, the Japanese returned formal control of Indochina to the French. France and 46 other non-communist states signed a peace treaty with Japan on September 8, 1951 in San Francisco. The French Assembly ratified the treaty on March 28, 1952. The required number of Allied nations ratified the treaty on April 15, 1952 and the treaty took effect on April 28, 1952. Japan and France were both members of a variety of international organizations created in the wake of World War Two. These include the United Nations, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Monetary Fund.
