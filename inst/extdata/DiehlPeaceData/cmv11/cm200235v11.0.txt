TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3135 from cm narrative, this is connected to UK's attempt to block Rhodesia's independence from Britain. From NYT 4/19/1966, the UK was blockading Rhodesia as part of UN sanctions against Rhodesia, which had just declared independence. That independence declaration was not recognized by UK, who still claimed Rhodesia as its colony. Portugal and South Africa supported Rhodesia and refused to take part in the sanctions and continued trading with Rhodesia, bringing them into this MID against UK, who was enforcing the embargo. Coded third party link to territory because this MID between UK and Portugal is connected to UK's claim on Rhodesia.
