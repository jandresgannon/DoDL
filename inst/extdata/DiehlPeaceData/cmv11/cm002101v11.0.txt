In mid-October, 2000, the United States Coast Guard boat Gendian was accused by the Venezuelan government by violating their territorial waters at the mouth of Orinoco River. On October 21, the United States Coast Guard boat Reliance was intercepted by a Venezuelan patrol boat, Patria. Reliance left the area after four Venezuelan airplanes came to the scene. Claiming that this was the second time in less than a month that such a violation of territorial waters took place, the Venezuelan government issued a formal protest to the United States government. In their reply to the Venezuelan protest, United States officials claimed that the incident took place in international waters and that Venezuela used disproportionate military power. First day of dispute was on 10/21/2000 and last day of dispute was on 10/21/2000.

President Hugo Chavez becomes president on 2 February 1999. Relations between Venezuela and United States begin to worsen when Chávez on 14 May 2002, alleged that he had definitive proof of U.S. military involvement in April's coup. He claimed that during the coup Venezuelan radar images had indicated the presence of U.S. military naval vessels and aircraft in Venezuelan waters and airspace. Relations between the United States and Venezuela have since seen tensions rise between both countries.(source:http://central.gutenberg.org/articles/eng/United_States–Venezuela_relations) Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. in September 2008 in solidarity with Bolivia after a U.S. ambassador was accused of cooperating with violent anti-government groups in that country, though relations were reestablished under President Barack Obama in June 2009. In February 2014, the Venezuelan government ordered three American diplomats to leave the country on charges of promoting violence.
Relations between the two countries have plunged to their worst level in years after the United States imposed economic sanctions against the Government of Venezuela due to abuses against protesters during the 2014–15 Venezuelan protests and allegations by the Venezuelan government that the United States was attempting to institute a coup. Throughout this period, Chavez tightened relations with Cuba, a US rival, and was hostile toward Colombia in opposition to US influence there.
