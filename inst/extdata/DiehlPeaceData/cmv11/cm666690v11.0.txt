MID1035

TERRMID: MID1035 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1035 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1035 from Gibler 2018, this is the 6-day War between Israel and Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. In 1967, Israel attacked Egypt, having already attacked Jordan the year before and expecting that other Arab countries would soon attack Israel. Israel handily defeated the Arab states and took control of territory in Sinai, Golan Heights, and elsewhere. Coded territorial MID because this is connected to a dispute over Israel's boundaries.
