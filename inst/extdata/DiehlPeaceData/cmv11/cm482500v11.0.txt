CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from Gibler 2018, Zaire was experiencing civil war, and the rebels were being supported by Angola and Cuba. Several countries offered assistance to Zaire to defend against the rebels, pulling them into this MID against Cuba and Angola. Coded civil war link because this was connected to a civil war in Zaire, outside this dyad, and coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 considers Uganda and CAR to be on the same side in this dispute, as both offered support to Zaire.
