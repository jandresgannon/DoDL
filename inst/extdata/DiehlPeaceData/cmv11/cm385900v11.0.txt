The Norwegian motor vessel Tampa entered the Australian territorial waters and approached Christmas Island on August 30, 2001. The Australian government refused the right of entry for the vessel into its waters. However, the boat entered the Australian waters and the Australian troops boarded the ship. Norway reacted angrily, saying that it had reported Australia to the UN bodies responsible for shipping and refugees, and also the International Committee of the Red Cross. First and last day of dispute was on 8/30/2001.
