CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4054 the events of this MID include militarized rebel groups fighting in Afghanistan while trying to cross into Afghanistan (Agence France Presse 7/28/1993). This MID is therefore a civil war MID since it involves rebel-associated violence in Afghanistan, within this dyad. See CIVWARLINK-NOTES. 

CIVWARLINK: MID4054 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4054 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4054 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, militarized rebels in Tajikistan were targeting Afghanistan, where a civil war was ongoing in 1993. A coalition of Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan joined Tajikistan in shows of force and/or clashes with Afghanistan, who repeatedly crossed into Tajikistan to attack the rebels. Coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Tajikistan, outside this dyad.

Dispute involves a series of 23 distinct incidents in which Russia and Tajikistan, sometimes supplemented by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, trade threats, shows of force, border fortifications, and attacks with Afghanistan. The dispute primarily revolves around Afghan incursions into Tajikistan and support of militant forces in Tajikistan. In response, Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Turkmen, and Tajik forces were deployed along the Afghan border and placed on alert. In addition, Russian forces fired artillery and air strikes into Afghanistan as a means of striking militants operating out of Afghanistan. In response, Afghanistan filed protests, threatened retaliation for the strikes, and threatened war if the strikes continued. The most serious event in the dispute occurred when Afghan forces crossed the border into Tajikistan and captured a Russian border post. The fighting that ensued killed a total of 27 people on both sides. First day of dispute was on 3/3/1993 and last day of dispute was on 8/7/1993.
