The LAS Council appealed for a troop withdrawal, and established a six-member conciliation commission (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya) on October 20, 1963. Morocco refused to cooperate with the LAS conciliation commission, which visited Algiers and Rabat on October 22-27, 1963. Cuba provided 50 military advisors and weapons to Algeria on October 21, 1963 and 400 Cuban troops and tanks arrived in Algeria on October 27, 1963.

Emperor Selassie and President Keita mediated negotiations in Bamako, Mali on October 29-30, 1963, and the parties agreed to a ceasefire that went into effect on November 4, 1963. Some 300 Algerian soldiers and 200 Moroccan soldiers were killed during the conflict. Algeria and Morocco agreed to establish an ad hoc commission of military observers (Ethiopia, Mali, Algeria, Morocco) to monitor the ceasefire. OAU foreign ministers established a seven-member arbitration commission (Ethiopia, Mali, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tanganyika) on November 18, 1963. Algerian and Morocco signed an agreement on February 19, 1964, which provided for the withdrawal of troops and the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the disputed territory. The *International Committee of the Red Cross *(ICRC) facilitated the signed of an agreement on April 15, 1964, which provided for the repatriation of 379 Algerian prisoners-of-war and 57 Moroccan prisoners-of-war. The commission of military observers was withdrawn from the border region on April 30, 1964. Algeria and Morocco issued a joint statement on May 12, 1964, which committed both parties to peacefully procedures in resolving the dispute. Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on June 18, 1964. President Achmed Ben Bella of Algeria and King Hassan II of Morocco met in Saidia in May 1965. Morocco accused Algeria of occupying part of the demilitarized zone on May 23, 1966, and referred the matter to the OAU arbitration commission. The OAU disbanded the arbitration commission in June 1967. President Houari Boumedienne of Algeria met with King Hassan II in Morocco on January 11, 1969, and the countries signed a treaty of solidarity and cooperation in Ifrane on January 15, 1969. President Boumedienne and King Hassan II met in Tlemcen, Algeria on May 27, 1970, which provided for bilateral negotiations concerning the border dispute. Algeria and Morocco signed a border delimitation agreement in Rabat on June 15, 1972. Algeria ratified the border agreement on May 17, 1973. Algerian troops and Moroccan troops clashed in Spanish Sahara (Western Sahara) beginning on January 27, 1976. Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Algeria. Egypt mediated a ceasefire between the countries on February 5, 1976. Some 30 Algerian soldiers were killed during the conflict. Algeria accused Morocco of supporting Algerian rebels on December 16, 1978. President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria held a summit meeting with King Hassan II on February 26, 1983. Algerian troops and Moroccan troops clashed near the border on June 15, 1984, resulting in the deaths of two Moroccan soldiers. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia facilitated negotiations concerning the Western Sahara between President Bendjedid and King Hassan II in Oujda, Morocco on May 4, 1987. Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on March 16, 1988.

Morocco's claim that Algeria is sending terrorists into its territory created another crisis on July 17, 1985, between the Arab neighbors, which have come close to war several times since 1975 over the former Spanish Sahara. Moroccan Interior Minister Driss Basri told a news conference in Rabat that several Moroccan dissidents trained and armed in Algeria by Algerian military intelligence officers had been arrested while planning a campaign of terrorism against the Moroccan authorities. Newspapers and broadcast stations in Morocco asserted that Algeria had launched a campaign to overthrow King Hassan II by subversion and violence. Algerian spokesmen and the leftist government's state-run news media responded sharply. They accused Morocco of spreading "deliberate falsehoods" intended to create renewed tension in North Africa and embarrass Algeria just before the Organization of African Unity summit, which begins Thursday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Western diplomats in Algiers described the official Algerian reaction as "relatively muted," however. They suggested that the crisis was part of the decade-old propaganda war linked to the Sahara conflict, which has led Morocco and its ally, Zaire, to boycott the OAU meeting.
One diplomat noted that the new row began on the same day that Hassan's chief political adviser, Redi Guedira, delivered a personal message from Hassan to Algerian leaders on an Arab summit due to convene soon in Morocco. Algerian news reports of Guedira's mission referred with unusual politeness to "his majesty the king of Morocco." Algeria and Morocco broke diplomatic relations 10 years ago, but this is the first time since 1973 that King Hassan's conservative government has accused the neighboring country of sponsoring terrorism against it. Morocco annexed the former Spanish colony in 1975 _ after Spain gave up its claim _ on the basis of the centuries-old allegiance to the Moroccan crown by the tribes there. Algeria made no territorial claims, but provided sanctuary, arms and political and financial backing to the Polisario guerrilla movement seeking independence for the desolate, phosphate-rich territory and its 80,000 inhabitants. With an estimated 100,000 troops and a 1,000-mile-long defensive wall of rock and sand built through the desert, Morocco has virtually eliminated the military threat once posed by Polisario. Algeria has succeeded in winning majority support for formal admission of Polisario as a full-ranking OAU member, however, which led to the Moroccan and Zairean boycott. The official Algerian news agency, quoting government spokesmen it did not name, said Basri's statement was "a clumsy and unscrupulous lie ... intended to tarnish Algeria's reputation as a respected member of the international community." It declared that Morocco was trying to create an artificial crisis prior to the OAU and Arab League summits in order to suggest that the two nations were virtually at war. In reality, it said, Algeria has no quarrel "with the brotherly people of Morocco." The only real conflict in the region is between Hassan and Polisario, the report said.

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia facilitated negotiations concerning the Western Sahara between President Bendjedid and King Hassan II in Oujda, Morocco on May 4, 1987. Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on March 16, 1988. The Moroccan leader's speech on 3rd March, 1989, marking the 28th anniversary of his enthronement was relayed by Rabat radio. He noted that although Algeria had ratified the treaty on border ratification reached between the two countries in 1972, Morocco had chosen not to do so. He went on ''Today we live in a period which is very different from the past. The future of our region is at stake; no one has the right to put it in danger. We have thought considerably and taken into account all the points stipulated in the past. We have decided to ratify the treaty on borders signed by Morocco and Algeria in 1972. Thus we for our part have neglected nothing to ensure that the foundations for the birth of our Arab Maghreb are completed.'' On 20th May, 1992, King Hassan of Morocco received Mohamed Boudiaf, the Chairman of the Algerian Higher State Council, Moroccan TV (Rabat) reported. 

Algeria closed its border with Morocco on August 27, 1994 in an escalating dispute over the arrest of two Algerians accused of plotting to attack Moroccan banks, security forces and civilians. The arrests were a sign Algeria's bloody Islamic insurgency could be spilling over into neighboring Morocco, where Muslim fundamentalists have so far been relatively quiet. The border already is believed to be a source of smuggled weapons for gunmen trying to overthrow Algeria's military-installed regime, which cancelled a January 1992 election the fundamentalists were expected to win. More than 4,000 people have been killed since then. State-run ENTV announced that the border was closed temporarily and did not say when it would reopen. There was no indication whether anyone except Algerians and Moroccans would be affected. Morocco announced visa requirements after police caught two Algerians in a chase and shootout in Fez. Hundreds of Algerians travelling to Europe by way of Morocco said they were stopped at the border and told they needed visas, which they were told could take weeks to obtain. About 14,000 Algerians live in Morocco, and 119,000 Moroccans live in Algeria. About 1 million Algerian tourists visit Morocco every year, and tens of thousands of Algerians cross into the country en route to and from Europe. 

On September 17, 1994, the Rabat government accused Algeria's secret service of trying to destabilize the political situation in Morocco by training and supporting two men allegedly involved in attacks in Morocco. It named them as Abdelylah Ziyad alias Rachid, a Moroccan born in 1958, and M'hamed Zineddine alias Said, Mourad and Mehdi, a Moroccan born in 1960. It said that "intensive investigations" in Morocco and France pointed to their involvement. Both were sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in 1985 for importing arms to Morocco from Algeria, and had been living in France and Algeria since the 1970s. "Both are holding legal travel documents delivered to them by the Algerian authorities. They both have always been used by Algerian security services," it added. The statement alleged that the desabilisation attempts began with the murder last month of two Spanish tourists in a Marrakesh hotel. Five weapons depots were later discovered. It added that Ziyad and Zineddine had been trained in the use of arms and explosives in Tindouf in southern Algeria with members of Polisario-the group which proclaimed Western Sahara independent.

Libya and Tunisia have decided to take steps to resolve a dispute over Western Sahara which has set Algeria against Morocco and threatened to upset the Arab Maghreb Union, Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi said on October 30, 1996. "I have agreed with the Tunisian president to work towards a solution between Algeria and Morocco in order to protect the Arab Maghreb Union," Kadhafi, who arrived in Tunis, told Tunisian students. The seven year-old Arab Maghreb Union, which is made up of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia, is going through a serious crisis because of the dispute between Algeria and Morocco. The issue of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara is "the direct cause" of the crisis, Kadhafi said. "Morocco is making accusations and Algeria is defending itself, and it looks like the problem is being used as a pretext for blocking the process of the Arab Maghreb Union," he said. The Sahrawi Polisario Front began fighting Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the Western Sahara, in 1975. Polisario is seeking the independence of the Western Sahara. A ceasefire has been in force for five years. Algeria has long backed Polisario's efforts to promote sovereignty for the former Spanish colony. The United Nations has undertaken to organize a referendum on self-determination in the territory, but its efforts have stalled in the face of obstacles from both sides. Polisario and Morocco notably disagree on who should be entitled to vote in the referendum. Many Sahrawis live in exile and many Moroccans have settled in the territory. The Arab Maghreb Union stopped being operational last year after Morocco protested against Algeria's attitude towards Western Sahara. Kadhafi said he believed there was "an American-Zionist plot" against the Arab Maghreb Union, and that whoever was "blocking the (union's) process" necessarily became a part of the plot. He denounced Morocco for blocking the whole union, saying it could have simply pulled out. 

Algerian interior and local government minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni is making a day-long visit to Morocco on November 16, 2000, at the invitation of his Moroccan counterpart, Ahmed El Midaoui, the Moroccan Press Agency reported. However, the agency did not give further details about its purpose. El Midaoui had paid a short visit to Algeria in April 1999, for discussions with Zerhouni. Relations between Morocco and Algeria have been relatively tense since the two countries closed their land borders in 1994, following an armed attack in Marrakech. The two belong to the Arab Maghreb Union together with Libya, Mauritania and Tunisia. Ties between Rabat and Algiers have rather been frosty mainly because of Algeria's support for the POLISARIO Front, which has been fighting for the independence of the Western Sahara.

Algerian Interior Minister Nourredine Yazid Zerhouni, arrived to Morocco on March 15, 2002, for a working visit amid growing tension over the disputed territory of the Western Sahara, an official said. Zerhouni was due to hold talks with his Moroccan opposite number Driss Jetou, the Moroccan news agency MAP said. The two ministers arranged the meeting in November 2001. The Algerian minister's visit comes at a time when relations between Morocco and Algeria are deteriorating because of a dispute over the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara. Algeria backs the Polisario Front, a guerilla organisation intent on winning self-determination for the mineral-rich, sparsely populated desert occupied by Morocco after Spain, the former colonial power, withdrew in 1975. Years of UN efforts to organize a referendum on self-determination in the territory bordering on southern Algeria have led almost to nothing because of disagreements over who should vote, and the Polisario Front has been threatening to resume fighting. The border between Algeria and Morocco has been closed since 1994 after a terrorist attack on a Marrakesh hotel, blamed by Rabat on Algerian secret services. Algeria's Economic Minister Mourad Mdelsi was in Rabat on Thursday attending a financial summit of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) which comprises Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania.

Algeria's Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem began a two-day visit to Morocco on February 6, 2003, as the two countries seek to resolve a quarter-century-old dispute over Western Sahara. Belkhadem met with his Moroccan counterpart, Mohamed Benaissa, followed by talks with Prime Minister Driss Jettou. Officials said the talks were to focus on Western Sahara and include the Iraqi crisis among other issues. Benaissa was due to meet Morocco's King Mohammed VI on February 7, 2003. The meetings come shortly after a visit to North Africa by former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, a personal envoy of the U.N. secretary-general, who presented a U.N. proposal for a political solution to the Western Sahara conflict that provides for self-determination. No information has been released about the plan. Baker visited Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania on Jan. 14-17, 2003, for meetings with government officials and the rebel leaders who are seeking independence for Western Sahara. Baker has spent nearly six years trying to negotiate an end to the dispute over the mineral-rich desert region on Africa's Atlantic coast, which is claimed by both Morocco and the Polisario rebel movement, which Rabat accuses Algiers of supporting. The dispute over the Western Sahara dates to 1975 when Spain abandoned the territory and Morocco annexed it, moving settlers in. Some 200,000 local Saharawi people fled into exile and still live in refugee camps in Algeria. Fighting ended in 1991 with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire that called for a referendum on whether the territory would become independent or part of Morocco. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara was granted a two-month extension to give the warring sides time to consider Baker's proposal. Without the extension, it would have ended Jan. 31, 2003. Morocco has supported autonomy, but the Polisario Front and Algeria will not consider it and demand a referendum.

A newspaper interview by an Algerian general downplaying independence for Western Sahara has sparked hope of reconciliation between Algeria and Morocco in their longstanding dispute. Speaking on March 11, 2003, to the Moroccan daily La Gazette du Maroc, General Khaled Nezzar said "Algeria does not need a new neighboring state", referring to Western Sahara, a territory annexed by Morocco after Spain's withdrawal in 1975. Algeria has been a backer of the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for Western Sahara. There could be a solution with "no winners or losers", Nezzar said. Unconfirmed reports said Morocco's King Mohammed VI could meet Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika this week. Relations between Algeria and Morocco have also been soured by suspicions that they support each other's Islamic extremists. The border between the two countries has been closed since 1994 after a terrorist attack in Marrakesh. 

The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Mohamed Benaissa said 13 June, 2003, that meetings he will hold during his visit to Algiers will discuss questions of common concern. Benaissa told the London-based "Asharq Al-Awsat" daily the meeting will probe questions related to the Maghreb, the Islamic world, the situation in Africa and cooperation between Rabat and Algiers as countries that concluded association accords with the European Union. Benaissa added that his meeting Algerian peer, Abdelaziz Belkhadem, will be "brotherly" and part of other encounters between high officials of the two countries. The Moroccan official voiced hope to see differences between the two countries settled to pave the way for the consolidation of bilateral relations in all realms which will naturally profit to the Maghreb Arab Union (UMA, mustering Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) and reactivate its structures. Algeria and Morocco can play active roles in fostering cooperation among African countries, he said, recalling King Mohammed VI's interest in South-South cooperation particularly with African countries. Benaissa expressed hope to see Algeria and Morocco working side by side to support NEPAD (the new partnership for Africa's development). Mohamed Benaissa, the Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, in Rabat, called on negotiations with Algeria over the fate of Western Sahara, on August 1, 2003. 

Newspapers accused Algeria on August 6, 2004, of slamming shut the door to reconciliation with Morocco after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika again demanded a referendum in the Moroccan-held Western Sahara. Bouteflika sent a message to UN Secretary General Annan August 3 reiterating Algeria's support for a referendum in the territory, which Morocco annexed in 1975 but where the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, is fighting for independence. "Every time there is an opening in the clouds of Morocco-Algerian relations, the Algerian authorities intensify their efforts to close the door to reconciliation," the daily Attajdid said. It was referring to the Moroccan decision to annul visa requirements for visitors from Algeria as from July 30, 2004. Aujourd'hui le Maroc said Bouteflika had rejected any political solution to the Sahara conflict, while L'Opinion questioned Algeria's "anachronistic" response to the hand tended by Morocco. The Moroccan government has stated its willingness to improve relations with the country's key neighbors, Algeria and Spain, and the decision to drop visa requirements was unilateral. Moroccans going to Algeria still need a visa, while a mixed commission studies the question of opening of the frontier, which has been closed since 1994. Moroccan Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa said this week he hoped Algeria would respond to the Moroccan gesture "by facilitating contacts between peoples and families of the two countries."

Reopening the land border between Algeria and Morocco could take months, even though both sides have lifted visa restrictions as part of a thaw in relations, the Algerian president said on April 5, 2005. Algeria announced on April 2, 2005, that Moroccans would no longer need visas, a "good will" gesture responding to a similar Moroccan announcement last year covering visas for Algerians. Nevertheless, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who is visiting France, said that reopening the frontier between the two North African neighbors "will require many months." Morocco unilaterally imposed visa requirements for Algerians after a 1994 attack that targeted a Marrakech hotel. Morocco accused Algerian secret services of involvement. Algeria responded by closing the land border. Behind the dispute was another decades-old disagreement over the Western Sahara territory, which Morocco annexed in 1975 and claims as its own. Polisario Front rebels, based in southern Algeria, have declared it an independent state. Bouteflika, who spoke after lunching with French President Jacques Chirac, reiterated Algeria's position that the Western Sahara should be dealt with via the United Nations. Bouteflika and the king of Morocco, Mohammed VI, took a step toward easing tensions by meeting late last month on the sidelines of an Arab summit in Algeria.

Given that the Western Sahara issue, the main contentious issue of the rivalry between Morocco and Algeria has not been solved, and that the borders are still closed as of 1994, this rivalry has not ended.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Morocco claimed territories in French Algeria following its independence from Spain on April 7, 1956. Algeria formally achieved its independence from France on July 3, 1962. 

Immediately upon Algerian independence, Morocco celebrated a national holiday, but voiced concern over the 12,000 troops from the Algerian Liberation Front that remained in Moroccan territory. Algerian officials complained on July 6 that Moroccan troops had occupied the Saharan outpost of Saf Saf, 15 miles inside Algerian territory. Morocco claimed that Algerian troops had taken 3 Saharan posts within Moroccan territory. These disputes are designated MID1083.

Moroccan troops occupied the border posts of Hassi-Beida and Tindouf on October 1, 1963. Algerian troops attacked and captured Hassi-Beida and Tindouf on October 8, 1963, resulting in the deaths of ten Moroccan troops. Moroccan troops re-occupied Hassi-Beida and Tindouf on October 13-14, 1963. Algerian troops attacked and captured the Moroccan border post of Ich on October 17-18, 1963, resulting in the deaths of 25 Moroccan soldiers. Emperor Selassie and President Keita mediated negotiations in Bamako, Mali on October 29-30, 1963, and the parties agreed to a ceasefire that went into effect on November 4, 1963. Some 300 Algerian soldiers and 200 Moroccan soldiers were killed during the conflict. The conflict is designated MID1084. Algerian and Morocco signed an agreement on February 19, 1964, which provided for the withdrawal of troops and the establishment of a demilitarized zone in the disputed territory.

On October 27, 1975, King Hassan II of Morocco called upon his people to march into Spanish Sahara for God and their king. Hundreds of thousands showed up to claim the territory as Morocco's. This was MID1331.

Algerian troops and Moroccan troops clashed in Spanish Sahara (Western Sahara) beginning on January 27, 1976. Morocco severed diplomatic relations with Algeria. Egypt mediated a ceasefire between the countries on February 5, 1976. Some 30 Algerian soldiers were killed during the conflict. 

Algeria accused Morocco of supporting Algerian rebels on December 16, 1978. The accusation was reciprocated by Morocco in August of 1979 as fighting occurred between separatist rebel forces in the disputed territory. This was MID3024.

I did not find information on the one-day MID3113.

President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria held a summit meeting with King Hassan II on February 26, 1983. 

Algerian troops and Moroccan troops clashed near the border on June 15, 1984, resulting in the deaths of two Moroccan soldiers. This was MID3044. 

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia facilitated negotiations concerning the Western Sahara between President Bendjedid and King Hassan II in Oujda, Morocco on May 4, 1987. Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on March 16, 1988.

Morocco's claim that Algeria is sending terrorists into its territory created another crisis on July 17, 1985, between the Arab neighbors, which have come close to war several times since 1975 over the former Spanish Sahara. Moroccan Interior Minister Driss Basri told a news conference in Rabat that several Moroccan dissidents trained and armed in Algeria by Algerian military intelligence officers had been arrested while planning a campaign of terrorism against the Moroccan authorities. Newspapers and broadcast stations in Morocco asserted that Algeria had launched a campaign to overthrow King Hassan II by subversion and violence. Algerian spokesmen and the leftist government's state-run news media responded sharply. They accused Morocco of spreading "deliberate falsehoods" intended to create renewed tension in North Africa and embarrass Algeria just before the Organization of African Unity summit, which begins Thursday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Western diplomats in Algiers described the official Algerian reaction as "relatively muted," however. They suggested that the crisis was part of the decade-old propaganda war linked to the Sahara conflict, which has led Morocco and its ally, Zaire, to boycott the OAU meeting.
One diplomat noted that the new row began on the same day that Hassan's chief political adviser, Redi Guedira, delivered a personal message from Hassan to Algerian leaders on an Arab summit due to convene soon in Morocco. Algerian news reports of Guedira's mission referred with unusual politeness to "his majesty the king of Morocco." Algeria and Morocco broke diplomatic relations 10 years ago, but this is the first time since 1973 that King Hassan's conservative government has accused the neighboring country of sponsoring terrorism against it. Morocco annexed the former Spanish colony in 1975 _ after Spain gave up its claim _ on the basis of the centuries-old allegiance to the Moroccan crown by the tribes there. Algeria made no territorial claims, but provided sanctuary, arms and political and financial backing to the Polisario guerrilla movement seeking independence for the desolate, phosphate-rich territory and its 80,000 inhabitants. With an estimated 100,000 troops and a 1,000-mile-long defensive wall of rock and sand built through the desert, Morocco has virtually eliminated the military threat once posed by Polisario. Algeria has succeeded in winning majority support for formal admission of Polisario as a full-ranking OAU member, however, which led to the Moroccan and Zairean boycott. The official Algerian news agency, quoting government spokesmen it did not name, said Basri's statement was "a clumsy and unscrupulous lie ... intended to tarnish Algeria's reputation as a respected member of the international community." It declared that Morocco was trying to create an artificial crisis prior to the OAU and Arab League summits in order to suggest that the two nations were virtually at war.
In reality, it said, Algeria has no quarrel "with the brotherly people of Morocco." The only real conflict in the region is between Hassan and Polisario, the report said.

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia facilitated negotiations concerning the Western Sahara between President Bendjedid and King Hassan II in Oujda, Morocco on May 4, 1987. Algeria and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on March 16, 1988. The Moroccan leader's speech on 3rd March, 1989, marking the 28th anniversary of his enthronement was relayed by Rabat radio. He noted that although Algeria had ratified the treaty on border ratification reached between the two countries in 1972, Morocco had chosen not to do so. He went on ''Today we live in a period which is very different from the past. The future of our region is at stake; no one has the right to put it in danger. We have thought considerably and taken into account all the points stipulated in the past. We have decided to ratify the treaty on borders signed by Morocco and Algeria in 1972. Thus we for our part have neglected nothing to ensure that the foundations for the birth of our Arab Maghreb are completed.'' On 20th May, 1992, King Hassan of Morocco received Mohamed Boudiaf, the Chairman of the Algerian Higher State Council, Moroccan TV (Rabat) reported. 

Algeria closed its border with Morocco on August 27, 1994 in an escalating dispute over the arrest of two Algerians accused of plotting to attack Moroccan banks, security forces and civilians. The arrests were a sign Algeria's bloody Islamic insurgency could be spilling over into neighboring Morocco, where Muslim fundamentalists have so far been relatively quiet. The border already is believed to be a source of smuggled weapons for gunmen trying to overthrow Algeria's military-installed regime, which cancelled a January 1992 election the fundamentalists were expected to win. More than 4,000 people have been killed since then. State-run ENTV announced that the border was closed temporarily and did not say when it would reopen. There was no indication whether anyone except Algerians and Moroccans would be affected. Morocco announced visa requirements after police caught two Algerians in a chase and shootout in Fez. Hundreds of Algerians travelling to Europe by way of Morocco said they were stopped at the border and told they needed visas, which they were told could take weeks to obtain. About 14,000 Algerians live in Morocco, and 119,000 Moroccans live in Algeria. About 1 million Algerian tourists visit Morocco every year, and tens of thousands of Algerians cross into the country en route to and from Europe. 
On September 17, 1994, the Rabat government accused Algeria's secret service of trying to destabilize the political situation in Morocco by training and supporting two men allegedly involved in attacks in Morocco. It named them as Abdelylah Ziyad alias Rachid, a Moroccan born in 1958, and M'hamed Zineddine alias Said, Mourad and Mehdi, a Moroccan born in 1960. It said that "intensive investigations" in Morocco and France pointed to their involvement. Both were sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment in 1985 for importing arms to Morocco from Algeria, and had been living in France and Algeria since the 1970s. "Both are holding legal travel documents delivered to them by the Algerian authorities. They both have always been used by Algerian security services," it added. The statement alleged that the desabilisation attempts began with the murder last month of two Spanish tourists in a Marrakesh hotel. Five weapons depots were later discovered. It added that Ziyad and Zineddine had been trained in the use of arms and explosives in Tindouf in southern Algeria with members of Polisario-the group which proclaimed Western Sahara independent.

Libya and Tunisia have decided to take steps to resolve a dispute over Western Sahara which has set Algeria against Morocco and threatened to upset the Arab Maghreb Union, Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi said on October 30, 1996. "I have agreed with the Tunisian president to work towards a solution between Algeria and Morocco in order to protect the Arab Maghreb Union," Kadhafi, who arrived in Tunis, told Tunisian students. The seven year-old Arab Maghreb Union, which is made up of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia, is going through a serious crisis because of the dispute between Algeria and Morocco. The issue of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara is "the direct cause" of the crisis, Kadhafi said. "Morocco is making accusations and Algeria is defending itself, and it looks like the problem is being used as a pretext for blocking the process of the Arab Maghreb Union," he said. The Sahrawi Polisario Front began fighting Morocco, which claims sovereignty over the Western Sahara, in 1975. Polisario is seeking the independence of the Western Sahara. A ceasefire has been in force for five years. Algeria has long backed Polisario's efforts to promote sovereignty for the former Spanish colony. The United Nations has undertaken to organize a referendum on self-determination in the territory, but its efforts have stalled in the face of obstacles from both sides. Polisario and Morocco notably disagree on who should be entitled to vote in the referendum. Many Sahrawis live in exile and many Moroccans have settled in the territory. The Arab Maghreb Union stopped being operational last year after Morocco protested against Algeria's attitude towards Western Sahara. Kadhafi said he believed there was "an American-Zionist plot" against the Arab Maghreb Union, and that whoever was "blocking the (union's) process" necessarily became a part of the plot. He denounced Morocco for blocking the whole union, saying it could have simply pulled out. 

Algerian interior and local government minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni is making a day-long visit to Morocco on November 16, 2000, at the invitation of his Moroccan counterpart, Ahmed El Midaoui, the Moroccan Press Agency reported. However, the agency did not give further details about its purpose. El Midaoui had paid a short visit to Algeria in April 1999, for discussions with Zerhouni. Relations between Morocco and Algeria have been relatively tense since the two countries closed their land borders in 1994, following an armed attack in Marrakech. The two belong to the Arab Maghreb Union together with Libya, Mauritania and Tunisia. Ties between Rabat and Algiers have rather been frosty mainly because of Algeria's support for the POLISARIO Front, which has been fighting for the independence of the Western Sahara.

Algerian Interior Minister Nourredine Yazid Zerhouni, arrived to Morocco on March 15, 2002, for a working visit amid growing tension over the disputed territory of the Western Sahara, an official said. Zerhouni was due to hold talks with his Moroccan opposite number Driss Jetou, the Moroccan news agency MAP said. The two ministers arranged the meeting in November 2001. The Algerian minister's visit comes at a time when relations between Morocco and Algeria are deteriorating because of a dispute over the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara. Algeria backs the Polisario Front, a guerilla organisation intent on winning self-determination for the mineral-rich, sparsely populated desert occupied by Morocco after Spain, the former colonial power, withdrew in 1975. Years of UN efforts to organize a referendum on self-determination in the territory bordering on southern Algeria have led almost to nothing because of disagreements over who should vote, and the Polisario Front has been threatening to resume fighting. The border between Algeria and Morocco has been closed since 1994 after a terrorist attack on a Marrakesh hotel, blamed by Rabat on Algerian secret services. Algeria's Economic Minister Mourad Mdelsi was in Rabat on Thursday attending a financial summit of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) which comprises Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania.

Algeria's Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem began a two-day visit to Morocco on February 6, 2003, as the two countries seek to resolve a quarter-century-old dispute over Western Sahara. Belkhadem met with his Moroccan counterpart, Mohamed Benaissa, followed by talks with Prime Minister Driss Jettou. Officials said the talks were to focus on Western Sahara and include the Iraqi crisis among other issues. Benaissa was due to meet Morocco's King Mohammed VI on February 7, 2003. The meetings come shortly after a visit to North Africa by former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, a personal envoy of the U.N. secretary-general, who presented a U.N. proposal for a political solution to the Western Sahara conflict that provides for self-determination. No information has been released about the plan. Baker visited Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania on Jan. 14-17, 2003, for meetings with government officials and the rebel leaders who are seeking independence for Western Sahara. Baker has spent nearly six years trying to negotiate an end to the dispute over the mineral-rich desert region on Africa's Atlantic coast, which is claimed by both Morocco and the Polisario rebel movement, which Rabat accuses Algiers of supporting. The dispute over the Western Sahara dates to 1975 when Spain abandoned the territory and Morocco annexed it, moving settlers in. Some 200,000 local Saharawi people fled into exile and still live in refugee camps in Algeria. Fighting ended in 1991 with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire that called for a referendum on whether the territory would become independent or part of Morocco. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara was granted a two-month extension to give the warring sides time to consider Baker's proposal. Without the extension, it would have ended Jan. 31, 2003. Morocco has supported autonomy, but the Polisario Front and Algeria will not consider it and demand a referendum.

A newspaper interview by an Algerian general downplaying independence for Western Sahara has sparked hope of reconciliation between Algeria and Morocco in their longstanding dispute. Speaking on March 11, 2003, to the Moroccan daily La Gazette du Maroc, General Khaled Nezzar said "Algeria does not need a new neighboring state", referring to Western Sahara, a territory annexed by Morocco after Spain's withdrawal in 1975. Algeria has been a backer of the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for Western Sahara. There could be a solution with "no winners or losers", Nezzar said. Unconfirmed reports said Morocco's King Mohammed VI could meet Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika this week. Relations between Algeria and Morocco have also been soured by suspicions that they support each other's Islamic extremists. The border between the two countries has been closed since 1994 after a terrorist attack in Marrakesh. 

The Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Mohamed Benaissa said 13 June, 2003, that meetings he will hold during his visit to Algiers will discuss questions of common concern. Benaissa told the London-based "Asharq Al-Awsat" daily the meeting will probe questions related to the Maghreb, the Islamic world, the situation in Africa and cooperation between Rabat and Algiers as countries that concluded association accords with the European Union. Benaissa added that his meeting Algerian peer, Abdelaziz Belkhadem, will be "brotherly" and part of other encounters between high officials of the two countries. The Moroccan official voiced hope to see differences between the two countries settled to pave the way for the consolidation of bilateral relations in all realms which will naturally profit to the Maghreb Arab Union (UMA, mustering Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) and reactivate its structures. Algeria and Morocco can play active roles in fostering cooperation among African countries, he said, recalling King Mohammed VI's interest in South-South cooperation particularly with African countries. Benaissa expressed hope to see Algeria and Morocco working side by side to support NEPAD (the new partnership for Africa's development). Mohamed Benaissa, the Moroccan minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, in Rabat, called on negotiations with Algeria over the fate of Western Sahara, on August 1, 2003. 

Newspapers accused Algeria on August 6, 2004, of slamming shut the door to reconciliation with Morocco after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika again demanded a referendum in the Moroccan-held Western Sahara. Bouteflika sent a message to UN Secretary General Annan August 3 reiterating Algeria's support for a referendum in the territory, which Morocco annexed in 1975 but where the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, is fighting for independence. "Every time there is an opening in the clouds of Morocco-Algerian relations, the Algerian authorities intensify their efforts to close the door to reconciliation," the daily Attajdid said. It was referring to the Moroccan decision to annul visa requirements for visitors from Algeria as from July 30, 2004.
