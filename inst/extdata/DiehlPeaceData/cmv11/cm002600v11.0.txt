TERRMID-NOTES: MID164 from Davis (1941), in 1904, a gang of badits in Morocco kidnapped a US citizen and his family. President Roosevelt was angered by this and demanded the Morocan government find and release the US citizens. The US made repeated demands of the Moroccan government and dispatched warships along with UK and France. Coded not territory because this was not connected to any territorial claim, but was an issue of a kidnapped citizen.
