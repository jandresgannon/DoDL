Germany, as part of a coalition, expelled Iraq from Kuwait. Coded third party link to territorial dispute because the Gulf War was a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, and Germany became involved to expel Iraq from Kuwait. MARITMID: MID3957 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID3957 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID3957 3 -- not civil war CIVWARMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES:CIVWARLINK: MID3957 3 -- not civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID3957 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID3957 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID3957 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID4273 TERRMID: MID4273 3 -- not territory TERRMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain TERRMID-NOTES: TERRLINK: MID4273 3 -- not third party link to territory TERRLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4273 also featured some clashes along the Kuwait-Iraq border, which was disputed, but this MID was not connected to the territorial dispute.

The US, UK, France, and other coalition forces (including Germany here) were attempting to coerce Iraq into complying with weapons inspections. Iraq also threatened the planes enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq, who were keeping Iraq from attacking rebel groups within its borders. Coded civil war MID because this involved threats by Iraq to US and UK war planes involved in preventing civil war activity between the regime and rebel groups in Iraq, and Germany is involved because of its role in the coalition forces. CIVWARLINK: MID4273 3 -- not civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID4273 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID4273 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3 1993-2001:MID4273rivalry=255645 nationa=GERMANY/PRUSSIA nationb=IRAQ MID4273 19991022-19991022  revtype1a=NOT APPLICABLE revtype2a=NOT APPLICABLE fatala=NONE fatalpa=0 lhosta=DISPLAY OF FORCE  revtype1b=POLICY revtype2b=NOT APPLICABLE fatalb=> 999 DEATHSfatalpb=. lhostb=WAR The dispute began (10/7/1997) because of increasing intransigence by Iraq. Iraq increased the frequency with which it violated the no-fly zones and threatened to refuse to allow Americans on the UN inspections team. Most importantly, Iraq threatened to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane. The United States and the United Kingdom responded by threatening military action if Iraq attempted to shoot down an American plane. Kuwait responded to the heightened tension between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq by putting its troops on alert. On 11/13/1997, Iraq carried out its threat to expel US Arms inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom began preparing for punitive air strikes against Iraq if Iraq did not begin to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. On 11/23/1997, Iraq allowed weapons inspectors to reenter, but it continued to hamper UN investigations, restricting access to selected sites. On 1/17/1998, Iraq again threatened to expel weapons inspectors, requesting that economic sanctions against it be lifted. The United States reiterated its threat to use force if Iraq did not allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected sites. The US and UK military buildup in the region continued and they announced that their forces were combat ready (2/7/1998). In MIDNovember, the United States reissued its threat to use force against Iraq if it did not unconditionally comply with UN weapons inspectors. All remaining weapons inspectors withdrew in response to the United States' warning. Iraq capitulated on 11/15/1998, promising to comply with the UN inspection teams. The United States and the United Kingdom stated that if Iraq did not continue to comply, they would use force against it. On 12/10, Iraq ended cooperation with UN inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would attack Iraq without warning for breaking it promise of full cooperation. On 11/16, they began "Operation Desert Fox," a four-day bombing campaign against Iraq. Israel also put its military on alert, fearing that Iraq would attack it in retaliation for U.S. and British military actions against Iraq. Almost immediately after the American and British bombing campaign, Iraq stated that it would challenge the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq (11/1998; 1/3/1999). There were clashes on almost a daily basis between British and American planes patrolling the northern and southern no-fly zones and Iraqi military installations from December 1998 to October 2001. Although clashes between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq occurred almost continuously until October, Iraqi challenges to the no-fly zones escalated in August 2001 and were more frequent until mid-October. On 2/15/1999, Iraq threatened to attack Turkey if it continued to allow American planes to use its bases. On 2/2/1999, the United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would retaliate if fired upon, by bombing pre-determined targets in Iraq that were deemed threatening. The United States and the United Kingdom engaged in numerous retaliatory bombing campaigns on Iraqi targets through October (2001), as Iraq continued to threaten and fire upon American and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones. On 10/22/1999, 11 nations (USA, UK, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Greece, and Germany) participated in joint military exercises to demonstrate that an anti-Iraq coalition could still be formed. On 5/23/2001 and 8/24/2001, an Iraqi patrol crossed into Saudi territory and fired on a Saudi border patrol. Iraq acted in order to demonstrate its disapproval of Saudi aid to the United States. On 6/11/2001, Saudi Arabia seized a unused pipeline from Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi violations of Saudi borders. First and last day of dispute was on 10/22/1999.NOTE THAT THE GERMAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE DISPUTE IS SHORTER THAN THE DATES AND ASSOCIATED INCIDENTS IN THE NARRATIVE FILERIVNOTES: NARRATIVE-CM:SOURCES-CM:NARRATIVE-CR:SOURCES-CR:SOURCES: Gibler, D.M. 2018.
