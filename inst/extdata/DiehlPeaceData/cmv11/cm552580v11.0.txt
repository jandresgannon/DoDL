TERRMID: MID1324 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID1324 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1324 from Gibler 2018, the UK was threatening to propose a UNSC resolution that would place sanctions on Rhodesia to punish the minority regime there. Malagasy, Congo, and Somalia called for force against Rhodesia (Rhodesia had recently declared independence and set up a white-dominated government). Coded not territory because this was an issue of regime type.

CIVWARMID: MID1324 3 -- not civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1324 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1324 Rhodesia did contain a militarized rebel group that opposed the regime, but this MID involved the UK threatening sanctions/international consequences against Rhodesia for declaring independence as a white-dominated, exclusionist regime instead of a democratic regime. There is no indication that the UK was motivated by the presence of militarized rebels in Rhodesia, making this a regime type issue. A LexisNexis and NYT search did not return any coverage indicating that UK or other parties to this MID (Congo, Somalia, Madagascar) were supporting or motivated by the rebels in Rhodesia.
