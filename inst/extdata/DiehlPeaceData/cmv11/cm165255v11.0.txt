NARRATIVE-CM:
The Uruguayan ship *Goriyia *was sunk by a German submarine in May 1917, and the Uruguayan government issued a formal protest to the German government. Uruguay severed diplomatic relations with Germany on October 7, 1917. The Uruguayan government seized eight German ships in Montevideo's harbor. On December 13, 1939, the German naval ship *Graf Spee* took refuge in the waters near Montevideo after being pursued by three British warships. Uruguay gave the crew of the ship four days to make its repairs and depart Uruguayan waters. The German crew scuttled the *Graf Spee* off the coast of Uruguay on December 17, 1939. Germany formally protested the incident to the Uruguayan government. The Uruguayan government ordered the arrest of 12 Nazi leaders in Uruguay on June 17, 1940, and the German government threatened to sever diplomatic relations unless the leaders were released. The Nazis were released on June 27, 1940. Uruguay requested and received military assistance from Argentina (deployment of gunboats in Uruguayan waters), Brazil (rifles and ammunition), and the United States (deployment of two military advisors and two warships) in 1940. The Uruguayan government re-arrested eight of the Nazi leaders in September 1940. Uruguay severed diplomatic relations with Germany on January 25, 1942. Uruguay declared war against Germany on February 15, 1945.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Uruguay and Germany takes place in the context of the second World War. While there are three disputes in the rivalry involving war issues, only two really involved militarized activity. On December 13, 1939 a German naval vessel crossed into Uruguayan waters to escape attack from British warships, MID3832. On March 10, 1942 Germany sunk the steamship *Montevideo* 300 miles off the Bermuda coast, MID3876. Finally, Uruguay issued a formal declaration of war against Germany on February 15, 1945 although the war against Germany was coming to a close, MID3508. This was probably due in large part to an Allied statement claiming that any nation wanting to attend the World Security Conference in San Francisco had to declare war with the Axis powers by March 1. Given these circumstances this rivalry lacks the major contentious issue(s) found in the more traditional rivalries. Regardless, the rivalry is concluded with the defeat of Germany and its unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945.
