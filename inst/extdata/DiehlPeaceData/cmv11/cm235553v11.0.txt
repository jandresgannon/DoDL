CIVWARMID: MID1342 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1342 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1342 from Gibler (2018), Portugal had been targeted by rebels hiding in Malawi territory, and Portugal accused Malawi of supporting the rebels. Mozambique was a colonial possession of Portugal at this time, and the rebels wanted to drive them out of Mozambique. This dispute is therefore Portugal-Malawi rather than Mozambique-Malawi, since Mozambique was not an independent state yet. A clash between Portuguese and Malawian forces occurred when tensions involving the accusations boiled over. Coded civil war MID because this dispute is centered on anti-Portugal rebels hiding in Malawi and Portuguese accusations of Malawian state support for the rebels. This is a colonial civil war MID.
