USE OF FORCE 

The Sudanese military in March 2002 mobilized additional troops at its border with Eritrea to prevent any incursion into the state by SPLA rebels acting from bases in Eritrea. This was followed in April 2002 when Sudan places its border forces and general populace on alert after reports of SPLA rebels infiltrating the country from Eritrea. In October 2002, the dispute escalated, as the Sudanese government accused the Eritrean military of fighting alongside and supporting the SPLA during a military offensive beginning on October 5, leading to clashes between the two countries. On October 13, Sudan took several Eritrean soldiers prisoner after a clash. Sudanese and Eritrean military forces clashed again on October 18, near the countries shared border after Eritrean soldiers entered Sudanese territory. The news report states that the Eritrean soldiers were repelled by Sudanese forces. The last available incident was when, on October 21, the Sudanese internal security forces arrested several Eritreans, including two Eritrean diplomats, in Khartoum. First day of dispute was on 3/19/2002 and last day of dispute was on 10/18/2002.
