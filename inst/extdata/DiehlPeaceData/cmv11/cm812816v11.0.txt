TERRMID-NOTES: MID1350 from cm narrative, a series of border incidents occurred, and the North Vietnamese government accused the Laotian government of violating the border. Laos argued that the Geneva Conference of 1954 clearly defined the border and they were not violating that agreement. However, it appears that North Vietnam was deceptively accusing Laos of violating the border to justify a military response. Coded non-territorial because these border clashes were not an attempt to claim territory.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1350 from cm narrative, the MIDs in the 812816 dyad "are centered on the desire of the North Vietnamese communist government and military forces to support the Pathet Lao communist insurgents in Laos." Civil wars occurred in Laos from 1958-1962 and 1963-1973, both involving communist rebels partially backed by the North Vietnamese. Another event in MID1350 involves a border outpost being overrun by Thai tribesmen, precipitating fighting between the two countries. Coded civil war MID because the Pathet Lao was being funded and armed by the Vietnamese government, which was the source of tensions that led to the clashes of MID1350.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID2029 involves a false/deceptive claim of a violation of the border. From the cm narrative, Laos claimed that North Vietnamese troops invaded a village in the northern part of the country. Following suspicion of the claim by SEATO and American news outlets, Laos admitted that the incident never occurred and it was an attempt to send a signal to its domestic audience that "Laos could count on the aid of its outside friends." Coded not territory because the boundary was not disputed, and there was no actual MID.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1363 the events that comprise MID1363 are actions by the North Vietnamese that assist the communist rebels in Laos who were fighting a civil war against the Laotian government from 1958-1962. From the cm narrative, the Vietnamese provided technical support, allowed supplies to be airlifted from North Vietnam, and even participated in direct confrontation against the Laotian government along with the rebels. Because this was not with the intention of claiming territory for the Vietnamese government, and the border was legally settled, this MID is not coded as territorial, only as a CIVWARMID.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The MIDs that constitute the rivalry between Laos and North Vietnam are centered on the desire of the North Vietnamese communist government and military forces to support the Pathet Lao communist insurgents in Laos. From 1958 until 1962 and again from 1963 until 1973 factions vied for control of Laos in two civil wars. The Pathet Lao factions in the north were communist and were backed by Hanoi, Peking and Moscow. The Royal Laotian Government (RLG) based in Vientiane was backed by Washington and other western powers. The MIDs between Laos and North Vietnam take place in an internationalized civil war. 

MID1350 takes place from December 1958 until January of 1960. In late December 1958 a series of border incidents between the RLG and North Vietnamese troops. The North Vietnamese regime accused the RLG of violating their common border. The RLG countered arguing that maps recently agreed upon at a Geneva conference in 1954 clearly demarcated the border region. It appears that the North Vietnamese used a tactic of accusing border incursions by Laos to pave the way for their own military initiatives. In accusing Laos of border incursions they lay the obfuscate the clear location of blame when they (North Vietnam) make future border incursions. 

The actual occurrence of further events during this period are more doubtful. In July of 1959, a border outpost was overrun by Thai tribesmen and fighting broke out in the region. The RLG announced that it was being invaded by North Vietnam. Laos requested a UN investigation. Dag Hammarskjold sent a team to Laos but could not confirm the presence of North Vietnamese troops in Laos. The Pathet Lao were equipped and supplied by North Vietnam during this period. 

From December 27 1960 until January 6, 1961 it is reported that MID2029 takes place. Here the RLG information office released statements claiming that Laos had been invaded by North Vietnam (DRV) in the north eastern part of the country. The RLG claimed that 2,000 DRV troops invaded Nong Het. The New York Times and Washington Post reported the `invasion.' The SEATO council met on January 2, 1961 and determined that evidence supporting Laotian claims was circumstantial. Soon US papers were openly criticizing the RLG for fabricating the story to garner US support. The information minister subsequently admitted to the deception arguing that Laos needed to prove to its citizens that Laos could count on the aid of its outside friends. In short the existence of a MID here is suspect. 

From December 29, 1960 until April 20, 1961 MID1363 occurs. Here DRV technicians and instructors aided Pathet Lao forces in the Plain of Jars in northern Laos. The USSR airlifted supplies and weapons from North Vietnam to the Pathet Lao in Laos. DRV regulars were present in northern Laos from January of 1961 until late April of 1961. During March and February of 1961, DRV forces participated with Pathet Lao forces in direct confrontation with RLG forces. 

From January of 1962 until February of 1973 MID1353 takes place. This is the extended civil war between the rightist and communist forces in Laos. Here DRV forces participated actively in the Pathet Lao insurgency in Laos. The events in Laos and the events in Vietnam during this period become increasingly connected. The Pathet Lao supported the DRV forces and ensured its use of the Ho Chi Minhn trail. In 1966 it is estimated that as many as 70,000 DRV forces were fighting in Laos along side the Pathet Lao. Over the next decade the Pathet Lao occupied a greater proportion of Laos. 

The resolution of the rivalry between Laos and North Vietnam can be traced to the victory by the communist Pathet Lao forces in the civil war and the establishment of a new, communist form of government in Laos. The communist insurgent victory removes the incentive for hostilities by the DRV against the US backed right wing Laotian RLG. 

In February 1973 the end of the Vietnam War was in sight and the Pathet Lao and the RLG agreed to a ceasefire. Part of the agreement called for a neutralist government a strategy that had been tried and failed previously. A compromise government was formed in which the two sides would share power. The Pathet Lao moved 2500 forces into both the administrative and traditional capitals. With the final victory of the communists in Vietnam in 1975 the compromise government in Laos fell apart. In April 1975 Pathet Lao forces advanced on Vientiane. In May many of the rightist government officials fled to Thailand. In December of 1975 the take over of the government by the Pathet Lao was complete and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPRP) abolished the monarchy and coalition government. 

Subsequently, Laos maintained close relations with both Hanoi and Moscow and poor relations with Beijing. Laos became heavily dependent on Vietnam. In 1977, a Chinese backed insurgency began in Xieng Khonang. Vietnam assisted Laos with 45,000 troops to support the government. 

LPRP formalized governmental contacts with Hanoi at biannual meetings of the foreign ministers of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam starting in 1980 and through the joint Vietnam-Laos Cooperative Commission, which met annually to review progress of various projects. Other levels of cooperation between Laos and Vietnam existed, for example, party-to-party meetings and province-to-province exchanges, as well as mass organizations for youths and women. Meetings of the commission were held regularly. 

Vietnam has had considerable influence in Laos since 1975. In the Laotian Peoples Army (LPA), the Vietnamese advisers, instructors, and troops on station were a strong influence. Military cooperation was extensive, with logistics, training, and communications largely supplied by Vietnam throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The association between Laos and Vietnam is term `special relations." This term is used after the 1977 signing of the twenty five-year Lao-Vietnamese Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. This legitimized the stationing of Vietnamese army troops in Laos for its protection against hostile or counterrevolutionary neighbors. Another element of cooperation involved hundreds of Vietnamese advisers who mentored their Laotian counterparts in virtually all the ministries in Vientiane. Hundreds of LPRP stalwarts and technicians studied in institutes of Marxism-Leninism or technical schools in Hanoi.

On July 10, 1955, Laos' army attacked the forces of Pathet Lao, the Communist guerilla backed by North Vietnamese forces. The event occurred in the mountainous northern Laos. On April 24, 1955, Laos and North Vietnam signed a pact of non-aggression. On August 29, 1956, Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of Laos, signed another pact of peaceful coexistence with North Vietnam's leader Ho Chi Minh. In the previous years, Laos has accused North Vietnam of interference in its own domestic affairs by supporting Pathet Lao, the Laotian Communist guerilla.

The last MID of RIV1358, MID1353 ended on February 15, 1973. Vietnam has had considerable influence in Laos since December 2, 1975 when Vietnam backed Communist guerillas took over Laos. A significant change in attitudes and a continual integration of Vietnam and Laos followed afterwards. In the Laotian Peoples Army (LPA), the Vietnamese advisers, instructors, and troops on station were a strong influence. Military cooperation was extensive, with logistics, training, and communications largely supplied by Vietnam.

The association between Laos and Vietnam is called as `special relations." This term is used after the July 15, 1977 signing of the twenty five-year Lao-Vietnamese Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. This legitimized the stationing of Vietnamese army troops in Laos for its protection against hostile or counterrevolutionary neighbors. Another element of cooperation involved hundreds of Vietnamese advisers who mentored their Laotian counterparts in virtually all the ministries in Vientiane. Hundreds of LPRP stalwarts and technicians studied in institutes of Marxism-Leninism or technical schools in Hanoi.

After the signing of the treaty of friendship and co-operation between Laos and Vietnam in 1977, Vietnam has fully implemented its policy of assimilation in Laos. The treaty has allowed Vietnamese people to settle freely in Laos. Over 100,000 Vietnamese people have been resettled in central and southern Laos, especially in Khammouane, Saravane and Attopeu Provinces and the Bolovens plateau. Most of these Vietnamese settlers are administrators, technicians, workers, farmers or soldiers. Throughout these years, Vietnam has tried to send its authorities to all Lao villages to collect any agricultural products harvested by Lao farmers for feeding the Vietnamese soldiers operating in Laos. In addition, the Vietnamese authorities have set up their own administrative system to control the Vietnamese settlers in Laos so that they do not have to be under the administrative control of Lao authorities. In the meantime, the Vietnamese authorities have also concentrated on promoting Vietnamese culture and arts among the Lao people in southern Laos. In the recent past, the Vietnamese authorities recruited some 5,000 Lao children from this region to receive training in various fields, including culture, in Vietnam. Moreover, Vietnam has also sent its educational specialists to be stationed at various educational institutions in Laos. Lao students who have completed secondary education schooling in Laos will be sent to Hanoi for further study. There are currently over 20,000 Lao students in this category in Hanoi. Some high-ranking Lao administrative officials are also sent to Hanoi to attend seminars. For example, in July 1980 Vietnam sent Sanan Soutthichak, Khamphai Boupha and Singkapo Sikhotchounlamani for further training in Hanoi for over a year and five months. Any Lao officials who exhibit any ideas contradictory to those of the Vietnamese government will be sent to Vietnam to undergo a three-year Marxist-Leninist seminar program.

On April 30, 1979, Vietnam was stepping up its control over Laos with the support of the Soviet Union. Its aim is to realize the "Indochina federation" and its expansion in South-East Asia. Laos is now virtually under the military occupation of Vietnam. During the war of resistance against the US, Vietnam stationed tens of thousands of troops in lower Laos and the Plain of Jars in upper Laos in order to defend the "Ho Chi Minh trail". After the war, however, instead of withdrawing its troops from Laos, Vietnam has steadily reinforced its troops, stepped up its military occupation and built up new military bases there. Vietnamese troops stationed in Laos now stand at 50,000 to 60,000, even larger than the Lao troops, according to Western news agencies and Lao refugees abroad. The Vietnamese troops are headquartered in Seno near Savannakhet, central Laos. Large Vietnamese forces have been stationed around Vientiane where military bases are established. Military movements are now directed to upper Laos. On the pretext that "China is threatening Laos", Vietnam has reinforced its troops in upper Laos and along the Chinese-Lao boundary. This has broadened and intensified Vietnam's military control of Laos.

LPRP formalized governmental contacts with Hanoi at biannual meetings of the foreign ministers of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam starting in 1980 and through the joint Vietnam-Laos Cooperative Commission, which met annually to review progress of various projects. Other levels of cooperation between Laos and Vietnam existed, for example, party-to-party meetings and province-to-province exchanges, as well as mass organizations for youths and women. Meetings of the commission were held regularly.

December 2, 1980 marks the fifth founding anniversary of the LPDR. Over the past five years, because of the occupation and control by the Vietnamese regional hegemonists, Laos has gradually lost its independence and self-mastery in all respects; in the political, military, economic, foreign affairs and other fields. For a long time Vietnam had wanted the rich natural resources of Laos. Vietnam started conducting a survey of Laos' natural resources in the liberated zone. When they discovered important ore deposits, they would send troops to occupy them. They seized a coal mine in Ban Ban, a rare metals deposit in Lat Huang in Xieng Khouang Province, and a gold mine and other ore deposits in Attopeu and Saravane provinces. In recent years, using its assistance and co-operation with Laos as a pretext, Vietnam proceeded to seize a gold mine in Sam Neua Province, a tin mine in Thakhek, and an emerald mine in Savannakhet Province. All the minerals tracked are subsequently sent to Vietnam. Each year, Vietnam sends a large number of their people to cut down Lao forests everywhere and transports much valuable timber back to Vietnam. As a result of this unscrupulous felling of trees by the Vietnamese, the natural environment in Laos has been destroyed and eroded. Several forests have now become wasteland. To control and occupy Laos, Vietnam has sent between 50,000 and 60,000 troops and a large number of advisers into Laos. These Vietnamese overlords have become a heavy burden for the Lao people. Each year the Lao people have to contribute a great deal of food and necessities to feed these troops.

A mass meeting was held in Hanoi on 18th July, 1981, to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Vietnam-Laos treaty of friendship and co-operation. Present were Do Muoi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPV Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Phan Anh, Vice-Chairman of the National Assembly and Vice-President of the Vietnam-Laos Friendship Association said: ''The special relations between our two countries tempered with our blood have become an invincible force to guarantee all the victories of the revolution of Vietnam and Laos.'' He stressed that the Vietnamese people would do their best to develop their solidarity and co-operation with the fraternal Lao people, thus making an active contribution to the militant solidarity between the three Indochinese peoples in the interests of national independence and socialism of each country and of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Kongpheng Souttavong, counsellor of the Lao Embassy said: ''The Lao people are proud of having the Vietnamese people as a reliable friend and comrade. In the face of the Peking expansionists' threat and activities, the militant solidarity and co-operation between Laos and Vietnam and between the three Indochinese countries have become even more solid and indestructible.

From 1977 to 1987, since the signing of the Vietnam-Laos treaty of friendship and co-operation, Vietnam has assisted Laos in implementing 544 socio-economic programs, including 244 programs with non-refundable aid and 300 programs with long-term interest-free loans. Most of these programs have been completed and put into operation. They include programs for surveying and exploring mineral deposits and forests, including an iron mine in the Plaine des Jarres, Xieng Khouang; a coal mine in Saravane; a salt mine and gypsum mine in Savannakh; a potassium mine in the plains of Vientiane; and many forests in various provinces.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach promised on August 26, 1988, that ''if possible'' Hanoi will withdraw all its troops from Laos by the end of the year and speed up its pullout from Cambodia, a Thai spokesman said. Thailand and Vietnam also agreed to open bilateral talks on trade, refugees and the conflict in Cambodia, Thach said. ''The Vietnamese minister said that if possible all Vietnamese troops will leave Laos this year and that Vietnam will try to speed up the withdrawal of troops from Kampuchea (Cambodia),'' said Suvit Yodmanee, spokesman for the Thai Prime Minister. It was believed to be the first time Vietnam has announced a deadline for its unilateral pullout from Laos. Vietnam, which had about 40,000 troops in Laos until 1987, has been pulling them out of the tiny country between Vietnam and Thailand for more than six months. It is not clear how many Vietnamese remain in Laos. Diplomats said they believed the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops who have been in Laos since the early days of the Vietnam War was linked to Vietnam's increasing economic difficulties. Laos and neighboring China have also improved relations this year, reducing the need for Vietnamese troops, the diplomats said. Thach said the withdrawal from Laos had been discussed but declined to reveal any details. Asked about the number of troops in the country he said ''my memory is bad.''

On 13th February, 1992, in the framework of its visit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic, our government delegation led by Comrade Vo Van Kiet, member of the Party Central Committee Political Bureau and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, paid a courtesy call on Comrade Kaysone Phomvihan, Chairman of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and President of the LPDR. Chairman Kaysone Phomvihan welcomed the Vietnamese government delegation's visit to the LPDR at a time when the entire Laos was implementing the fifth LPRP Congress resolution, regarding the visit as a new indication of the fine Vietnam-Laos relations of special friendship and solidarity.

Vietnam and Laos have signed an energy agreement that will give Vietnam access to Laos's potentially abundant supply of hydro-electric power, Lao National Radio said on October 3, 1995. Vietnamese Energy Minister Thai Phung Ne signed the agreement with his Lao counterpart Soulivong Daravong, minister of industry, reports added. Ne was in Laos on a six-day official visit during which he toured all of the hydro-electricity stations in the country. The agreement stipulates that all hydro-power plants in Laos will provide electricity to southern and central Vietnam, but did not specify the amount of electricity to be supplied. Neighboring Thailand, currently Laos's major market for electricity, has pledged to take up to 2,100 megawatts of hydro-powered electricity by the year 2000, but prices remain an issue. Land-locked Laos, half the size of France, is one of the world's poorest countries but the mountainous, river-rich nation has vast potential as an exporter of hydro-electricity. Laos's agreement with Vietnam, which suffers an electricity shortage, could be used as leverage for price negotiations with Thailand, diplomats noted. Under the same agreement, Vietnam promised to supply electricity to Laos's northern provinces from its Hoa Binh hydro-power station in north Vietnam, the state-run radio added.

On March 4, 1996, Laos and Vietnam reached an agreement on cross-border goods transport during a recent seven-day working visit to Vietnam by a delegation of the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction. While in Vietnam, the Lao delegation called on Mr Phan Van Khai, vice prime minister of Vietnam, and held talks with delegations of the Ministry of Transport and Communication and of Post and Telecommunication Department of Vietnam. Both sides reaffirmed the materialization of agreements reached between the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the Communist Party of Vietnam, and between the two countries' governments. The discussion also touched upon the Lao-Vietnamese cooperation in building a port at Vung Ang, Hatinh Province, central Vietnam, this year. The two sides also discussed the renovation of road links between the two neighbors and with those in the sub-region, including Roads Nos 8 and 9, the economic survey of Road No 18 in southern Laos, business cooperation in communication, transport, post and construction areas. Vietnam also agreed upon cooperation in a bilateral fiberoptic project with Laos, which will link telecommunications among China, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, chairman of the Sub-Commission for the Vietnam-Laos Cooperation, received Deputy Chairman of the Laos-Vietnam Cooperation Sub-Commission Phimpha Thepkhamheung, in Vientiane on 20th August, 1996. The Lao guest informed his host of the fine results of cooperation between the two countries over the past six months, especially in the fields of education and training, transport and communications, and agriculture. He expressed his profound gratitude to Vietnam and his wish to further cooperate with Vietnam for his country's socioeconomic development. Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Khai reiterated Vietnam's desire and efforts to effectively implement the bilateral agreement on economic, cultural, scientific and technological cooperation in the interests of the peoples of the two neighboring countries. Meanwhile on 16th August, Lao Deputy Minister of the Interior Lt-Gen Soutchay Thammasith, who is also member of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, received a Vietnamese delegation from the Health Department of the Interior Ministry in Vientiane, led by its deputy head, Le Van Quang, who was on a working visit to Laos. The Vietnamese delegation had a working session with officials of the Lao Health Department of the Interior Ministry. The two sides exchanged experiences on their profession with a view to further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between the two departments.

At the end of June 1997, Electricity of Vietnam has completed and put into operation the 35-kV transmission line in Central Vietnam, from Khe Sanh to Lao Bao Border Gate. From here, this transmission line will be connected to Tchepone District of Laos. This is the second line linking Vietnam and Laos after the first 35-kV line from Moc Chau District (Vietnam) to Samneua (Laos) which was put into operation on April 30, 1996. In addition, Vietnam and Laos are constructing the third 35-kV transmission line connecting Son Kim (Huong Son District, Ha Tinh Province) with Lat Sao. The construction of these transmission lines is the initial step of Vietnamese and Lao power sectors in a bid to integrate their national power grids into those of the other countries in the region as part of the energy cooperation program between the ASEAN member countries. In the short run, Vietnam will sell electricity to Laos through these transmission lines, helping Laos satisfy power demands in some localities which the national power grid has yet to reach. In 1996, Vietnam sold to Laos about 200 million kWh through Moc Chau Samneua transmission line. With the two new lines to be put into operation this year, Vietnam will transmit to Laos an additional 200 million kWh/year. In the future when hydropower plants in Laos are completed, there will be surplus electricity in this country which will be transmitted to Vietnam. Laos is a country endowed with hydropower potential, the total possible exploitation capacity is estimated to reach 13,000MW. At present, Laos is implementing some mammoth hydropower projects such as Nam Theun (600MW), Theun Hinboun (210MW) and Houay Ho (126MW) while the demand for electricity of Laos is estimated to be only 85MW in the year 2000 and 170MW in 2010. In addition to energy, Vietnamese and Lao governments have also cooperated in communication projects, including East-West Corridor Route project. This route will link Vietnam and Laos to Thailand through Road 9, paving the way toward the sea for Laos via Tien Sa Port in Danang City. This project includes constructing a bridge across the Mekong River (the section between Thailand and Laos), upgrading 200km of Road 9 in Laos, upgrading National Highway 9 in Vietnam and setting up Tien Sa Port in Danang. The total investment capital for this project will be about US$ 130 million. In addition, Vietnam also coordinates with Laos to study the possibility of establishing a railroad network linking the two countries as well as connecting to those of other Southeast Asian countries. Also in the field of communication, Communication Work Construction Corp. 8 (Cienco 8) has gained a good reputation in Laos since 1991 through roads and bridges it has constructed here. Thanks to this prestige, Cienco 8 has won many construction bids such as upgrading some inner roads in Vientiane, National Highway 13 and some road sections in Sam Nua with a total value of nearly US$ 70 million. In the telecom sector, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia will invest some US$ 40 million in a common optic cable line with a total length of 600km. This is part of the project for setting up an optic cable line of six countries: China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Singapore. This optic cable line will begin in Shanghai, crossing Nanning to Vietnam through Lang Son Province, going to Vinh City (Nghe An Province) and along National Highway 8 to Vientiane. An official with Vietnam Post and Telecom Corp. revealed that the Vietnam-Laos optic cable line will be built by the end of 1997 and will be put into use before May 1998.

Lao Prime Minister Boun-gnang Volachit made an official visit to Vietnam on July 19, 2001. One of the major goals of this visit was to promote economic relations between the two countries.

The traditional solidarity and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and Laos are expected to get a boost with the upcoming visit to Vietnam by Chairman of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and President of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Khamtai Siphandon. The Lao leader will pay an official visit to Vietnam from 13-16 May, 2002, as a guest of both Party General Secretary Nong Duc Manh and President Tran Duc Luong. It is Siphandon's first overseas trip since his re-election as president of Laos in April 2001. The visit is of great significance as it takes place at a time when the two countries are making preparations for the 40th anniversary of their diplomatic ties and the 25th anniversary of their Friendship and Cooperation Agreement later this year. The foundation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in December 1975 ushered in a new stage of development in the bilateral relationship between the two countries, namely friendly relations, special solidarity and comprehensive cooperation. Since then, bilateral ties have undergone unceasing consolidation and development. Party, state, national assembly and government leaders of the two countries have held regular meetings to define orientations for bilateral multi-form cooperation. In addition, the two countries' ministries, localities and mass organizations have exchanged hundreds of visits in recent years. During the visit to Laos by Party General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, both sides affirmed their determination to maintain and unceasingly promote the special friendship and loyal relations between the two Parties and States of Vietnam and Laos. The two sides issued a Joint Communique, affirming their determination to boost bilateral economic-commercial, investment, transportation, energy, scientific-technological, environmental, education-training cooperation on a long-term basis. During the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Boun-gnang Volachit last July, the two countries signed four important cooperation agreements, providing a legal basis for further cooperation between Vietnam and Laos. Being members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the two countries have closely coordinated their activities at regional and international forums. At the 24th session of the Vietnam-Laos Inter-governmental Committee for Economic, Cultural, Scientific and Technological Cooperation in Vientiane last January, the two sides stressed the need to raise the efficiency of bilateral cooperation. Earlier, at the 23rd session in Hanoi in February 2001, they inked a number of economic, cultural, scientific and technological cooperation accords between the two countries for the 2001-05 and the 2001-10 period. Vietnam has provided effective assistance to Laos in the fields of education, agriculture, irrigation, transport and communication, construction, health care and culture. It has also created favorable conditions for Laos to transport its goods through Vietnam's territory and given Laos, a landlocked country, crucial access to Vung Ang and other sea ports. In a bid to enhance their bilateral trade ties, the two sides have opened a number of new border gates as well as upgraded and constructed road networks along their common borderline. Two-way trade between the two countries reached 130.2m US dollars in 2001 and 177m US dollars in 2000. The previous year, Vietnam exported goods worth 62.4m US dollars to Laos and imported agro-forestry products worth 67.8m US dollars from the country. Vietnam's main export items to Laoswere food, materials and consumer goods. The two countries have agreed to sharply reduce taxation on their original goods and encourage their businesses to increase two-way trade. Regarding investment, Vietnam has invested in and cooperated with Laos mainly in Vietnamese-funded projects and carried out transport, agricultural and irrigation projects in Laos. In addition, Vietnamese businesses have invested in such fields as trade, import-export activities, construction material, garment, pharmaceutical and, ceramic production, gypsum and salt exploitation, cultivation and livestock breeding. Vietnam now ranks 14th among 36 investment partners in Laos. Vietnam and Laos are trying to bring their economic and commercial ties to a level equal to their political ties and to the special friendship and solidarity between the two countries. Vietnam and Laos have enhanced cooperation in security and national defense by exchanging of visits. Vietnam's Minister of Public Security Le Minh Huong visited Laos in May, 2001; and Lao Defence Minister Duangchay Pichit, and a delegation of the Lao Interior Ministry visited Vietnam in February and March, 2002, respectively. Apart from bilateral cooperation, the two countries have also implemented multilateral cooperation. Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia agreed to make their development triangle part of the ASEAN sub-regional cooperation at a Prime Ministers' meeting of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos held last January in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam and Laos have also boosted cooperation between ministries and branches in the exchange of information, experience, training and experts.

Vietnam and Laos have agreed to further improve relations between their two armies in 2004, including stepping up joint training and information exchanges, state media said on March 3, 2004. The pledge came in a memorandum of understanding signed in the Lao capital of Vientiane by Vietnam's army chief of staff General Phung Quang Thanh and his Lao counterpart Major General Kenkham Senglathon. Thanh, who is also Vietnamese deputy defense minister, arrived in neighboring Laos on Monday on a three-day visit. He held talks with Lao Prime Minister Boungnang Vorachit, the Vietnamese army's Quan Doi Nhan Dan newspaper said. The countries are among the last of the world's surviving communist regimes. The previous month, during a visit to Hanoi by Soutchay Thammasith, acting Lao security minister, Vietnam pledged to work together with the Lao military to maintain security along their common border Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said strengthening cooperation was essential for nation building and maintaining security. Vietnam maintained an official military presence in Laos until 1989 and continues to exert considerable political influence in the country. Hanoi, however, has repeatedly denied that its troops are still active there, despite claims to the contrary by insurgency groups inside Laos. Some 50,000 Vietnamese troops helped the Lao military savagely crush a guerrilla army in 1978 that had been mobilized by the US Central Intelligence Agency to fight its secret conflict in Laos during the Vietnam War. But with the support of exile groups, mainly based in the United States, the guerrillas, mostly from the Hmong minority, have continued a low-level insurgency for nearly three decades.

Vietnam and Laos have pledged to promote their ties of economics, culture, science and technology after jointly signing an agreement witnessed by Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dzung and his Lao counterpart Thongloun Sisoulith on May 12, 2004 in Hanoi. Accordingly, the two countries agreed to expand their cooperation to benefit from the combined potential of air transportation, mining and rubber production this year and to speed up the implementation of transportation and power projects, including the construction of a hydro-electric power plant in Laos and Vietnam's purchase of electricity from Laos. The same day the Vietnam Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and the visiting Committee also signed another agreement concerning the Vietnam-Laos Planning and Cooperation in Hanoi for 2004. Under the minutes, the MPI will help the Lao counterpart build a cadre training center in Vientiane, which is expected to be in operation by July 2004. It will also help Laos open the first course on planning and investment for Lao officials at the center by the end of this year. The two countries also committed to a Vietnam-Laos cooperation agreement for 2004, particularly promoting investment and trade through two conferences to be held in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City later this month. Vietnam will also help build an IT network for the Lao Committee for Planning and Cooperation. Earlier, the Lao deputy prime minister held talks with Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, confirming that the two countries will make use of their long border to boost bilateral trade. Vietnam-Laos trade reached just $ 359 million in 2002 although it increased from $ 150-200 million per annum in previous years. Vietnamese enterprises have so far invested $ 18.9 million in a total of 29 projects in Laos, ranking 14th among 36 foreign investors in the neighboring country. Laos currently ranks seventh among Vietnam's ASEAN trade partners. It imports many industrial products from Vietnam including cement, iron and steel, and handicrafts, while exporting gypsum, coffee, and agricultural and forestry specialties to Vietnam.
