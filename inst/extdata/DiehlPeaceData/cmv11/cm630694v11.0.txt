TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3617 from Gibler 2018, in 1984 Iran attacked two Saudi oil tankers in the Persian Gulf that it suspected of carrying oil from Iraq. Iran routinely attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil during the Iran-Iraq War as a means of harming Iraq's economy. Iran also threatened the Gulf states that it would use force to close the Persian Gulf if Iraq did not stop its attcaks on Iran. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2587 from Gibler 2018, in 1986 Iran issued a threat to the Persian Gulf states that it would block the Strait of Hormuz, an important strait for oil transport. Iran was attempting to block ships from trading with Iraq in an attempt to harm Iraq's economy. Coded third party link to terriorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4522 from cm narrative, in 2004 Qatar fired upon and seized 2 Iranian fishing vessels, killing one fisherman in the process. It is unclear when or if the boats and fishermen were released by Qatar. Although Qatar claimed that the fishing vessels entered its waters, the two states were not contesting a maritime boundary at the time. Coded not maritime because the countries were not disputing a maritime boundary.

RIVNOTES: This is not a rivalry - all MIDS are related to Iran-Iraq war.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Iran and Qatar is associated with and caused by the war between Iran and Iraq from 1980 until 1988. After a period of stalemate in the war between Iran and Iraq, the war heated up in the Persian Gulf. The April 1984 attack on a tanker by Iraq marked the beginning of the first phase of the "tanker war," which continued for 18 months. During this time, more than 80 ships from various countries were targets. Both Iran and Iraq engaged in this form of conflict. Because of a glut on the international oil market, the fighting did not significantly affect the rest of the world and did not immediately threaten the Gulf sheikdoms like Qatar

MID3617 occurred from May of 1984 until July. This is a multilateral mid involving Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia vs. Iran. Here the issue is the war between Iran and Iraq. Iraq is receiving support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in its war against Iraq. Iran wants to limit that support. They do so by bombing Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf and making it clear that they are doing so in response to the Saudi support of the Iraqis. They widen the bombing to include tankers of all the gulf states. On 5/17/1984 Iranian war planes bombed a Saudi oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. This was the fifth such attack in a three week period. On May 21, 1984 an Iranian newspaper suggested that Iran's air force bomb power stations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to force them to stop supporting Iraq in its war with Iran. Iraq is also bombing Iranian tankers or tankers flagged with other countries that attempt to take on oil at Iranian ports. 

MID2587 is a multilateral mid involving Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait vs. Iran. This is a one day mid taking place on 8/29/1986. Here again the motivation for this mid is the squeeze Iran was trying to put on other gulf states in an effort to bleed Iraq dry of cash. Here Iran threatened to close the Gulf of Hormuz that would effectively cut off access to the Persian Gulf and cripple the oil exporting capacity of the Gulf States. 

MID2796 occurred on 5/22/1987. Qatar attempted to chart a neutral course in the Gulf War/Iran-Iraq War. As in previous mids, Iran attempted to squeeze the Gulf states into supporting its cause in the war. A Qatari freighter was attacked by an Iranian gunboat off the Bahraini coast. Three crewmembers were injured in the incident. 

Qatar was cooperative with the US in basing and allowing troops to deploy on its territory. Probably an issue you will want to discuss.

The Iran-Iraq War ended on August 20, 1988, with a UN proposed cease-fire. This marked the end of formal support by the Gulf States to the Iraqis. This in turn ended the motivation for the Iranians to militarily harass the Qataris. Because the rivalry between Iran and Qatar is a result of conditions and circumstances in the Iran-Iraq War, when the war ends so does the rivalry between Iran and Qatar. 

Qatar has had cordial relations with Iran, prior to and after their brief rivalry. In 1991 Shaykh Hamad ibn Khalifa welcomed Iranian participation in gulf security arrangements. Iran was one of the first countries to recognize Shaykh Khalifa ibn Hamad, the first emir of Qatar after independence from Britian, in 1972. Relations have been based partially on proximity (important trade links exist between the two countries, including a ferry service between Doha and Bushehr) and partly on mutual interests. Plans were being formulated in 1992 to pipe water from the Karun River in Iran to Qatar. The large Iranian community in Qatar is well integrated and has not posed a threat to the regime. Iran's claim in May 1989 that one-third of Qatar's North Field gas reservoir lay under Iranian waters apparently was resolved by an agreement to exploit the field jointly.
