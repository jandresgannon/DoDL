TERRMID-NOTES: MID2144 from Gibler 2018, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania launched a joint airline and each promised to maintain a certain level of funding for the venture. After some funding troubles, Kenya withdrew from the arrangement and created its own airline. In response, Tanzania closed the border and seized many Kenyan vehicles and arrested Kenyan workers. Kenya protested. Coded not territory because no border was being disputed. This is an economic/business dispute.
