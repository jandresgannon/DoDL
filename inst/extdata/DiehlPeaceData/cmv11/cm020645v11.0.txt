TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3957 from cm002645v11.0 narrative, this is the Persian Gulf War. Iraq invaded Kuwait, claiming its territory as rightfully Iraq's, and was defeated and pushed back into Iraq by a coalition of 34 nations led by the US. Coded third party link because a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait led Canada to be involved in this MID.
