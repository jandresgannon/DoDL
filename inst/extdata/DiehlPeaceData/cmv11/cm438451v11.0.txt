Nigeria intervenes on behalf of Sierra Leone's ousted government (removed from power on 5/25/97 by rebel forces), occupying and fighting in Sierra Leone for almost one year. The dispute ends after Nigeria successfully removes rebel government and restores power to ousted regime. Nigeria operated under the auspices of ECOWAS; but, with the exception of minimal support from Ghana and Guinea, Nigeria was basically operating unilaterally. First day of dispute was on 5/27/1997 and last day of dispute was on 3/10/1998.

DISPLAY OF FORCE 

This MID is a residual of the conflict in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is unable to control the various rebel groups operating within its territory; therefore, Guinean rebels use Sierra Leone as a staging ground for attacks on Guinea. In response, Guinea bombs Sierra Leonean areas where the rebels are encamped. First day of dispute was on 1/26/2001 and last day of dispute was on 6/4/2001.
