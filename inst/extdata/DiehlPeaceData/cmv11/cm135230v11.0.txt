NARRATIVE-CR:
Spanish intervention and the attempt to preserve Peruvian sovereignty characterized the rivalry between Spain and Peru in the19th century. The first mid in 1846 (MID1498 on 11/7) involved Peru's military and economic support of Colombia and Ecuador to fight against Ecuador's exiled dictator Juan Flores. Flores, under Spanish support, sought to establish a monarchy in Ecuador and perhaps even reestablish the Spanish monarchy in the region at large. In addition to this support, Peru joined a de facto alliance with Ecuador and Colombia to oppose all external intervention in Latin America. These actions fit within the larger framework of Peruvian foreign policy under President Ramon Castilla who sought to achieve solidarity within Latin America, nonintervention in Latin American affairs and the maintenance of Peruvian national integrity. Given that Spain during this period had failed to recognize Peruvian independence, Peru was extremely sensitive of any Spanish intervention in the region. Consequently, Peru actively sought to take action against Spanish intervention and diplomatically protested interventions in Santo Domingo and Mexico in the early 1860s. 

Increasing animosity between the two countries led to direct confrontation again from 1859 to 1865 through three militarized disputes that complete the rivalry (MID1594 beginning in April 1859, MID1595 on 8/10/1862 and MID1563 on 4/14/1865 ). Throughout this period, relations between the countries were the most strained, almost leading to war. As early as 1861, Spanish ministers were instructed to notify Peru that Spain would not tolerate acts against Spaniards living in Peru or negative remarks about Spain itself. In 1862, Spain decided to send a naval squadron into the region as a show of force (MID1595 on 8/10/1862). In February, 1863 the United States offered to mediate between Spain and Peru to improve relations. On August 4, 1863 in Chiclayo, Peru, one Spanish laborer was killed and four others injured over a contract dispute. The Spanish government demanded that the new Peruvian president Pezet intervene and resolve the case. In addition, Spain sent a special commissioner, Eusebio de Salazar y Mazarredo, to Peru to help with the resolution of the case. Due to his title, the Peruvian government refused to accept the commissioner. In response to this embarassment, Salazar y Mazarredo coordinated with the Spanish naval squadron commander Rear Admiral Pinzon to seize the Chincha Islands along with the Peruvian ship *Iquique* on April 14, 1864 (MID1563) . The Chincha Islands were a major economic resource to the Peruvian state because of its guano reserves. Salazar y Mazarredo stipulated that Spain would release the islands upon Peru's redressment of Spanish claims.

In the summer of 1864, the US offered to mediate the dispute but Spain declined. On September 9, 1864, the Peruvian congress authorized President Pezet to go to war if Spain did not release the islands back to Peru and salute the Peruvian flag. In October 1864, Britain and France proposed joint mediation which was not accepted. On November 14, 1864 at the inter-American conference in Lima, Latin American delegates called on Spain to reconsider its position, claiming that the occupation of the Chincha Islands threatened the region's stability. Spain dismissed these claims and the conference was unable to successfully resolve the dispute.

Peru began to alter its policy toward Spain after the conference due to pratical considerations. First, Spain added three frigates to its Pacific fleet, making any Peruvian military challenge impossible. Second, on November 8, 1864, Spain issued a statement that it had not intention on reestablishing its empire in the region and that its dispute was only to address repeated injuries against Spanish nationals and Spanish pride. Third, Pezet's government began to be criticized domestically by political opponents. On December 24, 1864, the Pezet administration sought to negotiate a settlement with Spain. The resulting Vivanco-Pareja treaty was severly criticized for undermining the Peruvian position and appeasing Spanish interests. The Peruvian congresss refused to even vote on ratifying the treaty, leaving President Pezet to issue a decree of approval on February 2, 1865. 

An opposition leader, Colonel Mariano Prado, instigated a revolt over the treaty and overthrew the Pezet administration in November 1865. Prior to the overthrow, however, the Pezet government was able to regain control of the Chincha Islands and pay Spain a $3 million peso indemnity. 

While these actions seemingly ended direct conflict with Peru, Spain maintained its naval forces in the region and began hostile acts against Chile for its support of Peru during the conflict. In May 1865, Chile declared war on Spain. Immediately, the Prado administration joined Chile with the signing of an offensive and defensive alliance pact. Bolivia and Ecuador signed on in 1866, leading to the formation of the Quadruple Alliance. On January 13, 1866 Peru declared war on Spain (MID1482). On April 25, 1866 Spain blockaded the Peruvian port of Callao. On May 2, 1866 Spain bombarded the port, suffering damage to its fleet. On October 6, 1866 US Secretary of State Seward offered to mediate the dispute. All disputants except Peru agreed to the mediation. Due to strong domestic support of the war, Peru refused the offer in March 1867. On March 27, 1868 the US offered to mediate again. Peru accepted the offer. On April 11, 1871 Peru and Spain agreed to an armistice. The new Balta administration in Peru, however, could not continue bilateral negotiations due to its alliance agreements, leading to a suspension of peace treaty negotiations on September 26, 1872. The deterioration of relations with Chile and Bolivia that soon followed, however, paved the way to the signature of a treaty of peace and friendship with Spain on April 14, 1879.

For Peru, this deterioration was due to its involvement in a dispute between Chile and Bolivia over the Atacama desert. In 1873, Peru developed interest in exploiting guano and nitrate deposits in its sourther provinces of Tacna and Arica that bordered the Atacama region. Concerned that Chile would encroach upon its interests in the region, Peru signed a secret pact of defense with Bolivia to protect the region against Chilean demands. When war broke out between Bolivia and Chile in 1879, Chile also declared war on Peru after discovering its secret pact with Bolivia, beginning the War of the Pacific that lasted until 1884. Fighting this war thus provided the opportunity for Peru to formerly settle its dispute with Spain since it was no longer honored by its pact as a member of the Quadruple Alliance. 

Also important to the peace was the gradual departure of the Spanish empire from Latin America. In 1868, Spain suffered a liberal revolution after suffering severe economic depression due to falling exports and a shrinking railroad industry. The depression was also deepened by the war with Peru and Chile in 1866 due to the fact that Spain alienated creditors in London and Paris who maintained economic interests in both countries. The Spanish economy at this point was rather strongly connected to both British and French capital markets. The revolution internally divided the Spanish government, from 1868 - 1874. Additionally in 1868, Cuba began its war of independence from Spain that lasted until 1878, further distacting Spanish interests from territory it had already lost to independence movements. By 1870, for example, Spain had sent over 100,000 troops to Cuba, to try and end the war. In 1874, Spain resumed its monarchy after the liberal revolution failed. The monarchy was able to end the war in Cuba with the peace of Zanjon in February 1878. Additionally during this period, it officially ended war with Peru with a treaty of peace and friendship on April 14, 1879. Peace and stability for Spain and its influence in Latin America, however, proved temporary as Cuban revolts for independence began again in 1895, leading to war with Cuba and the United States in 1898. With Spain's defeat, the Spanish empire in Latin America was terminated, thus ending the possibility of continued rivalries with any of its former colonies.
