NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Italy and Colombia in the 19th century involved the resolution of claims by an Italian national on the Colombian government. In July 1885, Colombia arrested an Italian national, Ernest Cerruti, charging him with treason against the state of Colombia, in addition to seizing his property. Italy sent an Italian cruiser to Colombia in an effort to force the Colombian authorities to release Cerruti, MID1764 and MID2004. On February 5, 1886 Italy accepted Spain to arbitrate the dispute, concerning the financial losses of its national. On February 22, 1886 Italy suggested it would resort to force if the arbitration was unsuccessful. In 1897, US President Grover Cleveland arbitrated the dispute, awarding financial claims to Cerruti. On July 13, 1898 Italian naval ships left for Cartagena, Colombia in order to seize a Customs House and settle financial claims from the Cerruti case at $250,000, MID2341. On August 3, 1898 Colombia agreed to pay the claims resulting from the Cerruti case. On August 12, 1898 Italy announced it would allow Colombia eight months to pay the claims. On September 26, 1898 the Colombian government announced it would not pay the Cerruti claims, arguing that it had evidence to prove that Cerruti was guilty as charged during his imprisonment. On January 1, 1899 Italy sent a naval squadron to Colombia to force the country to pay the award. On March 10, 1899 Colombia agreed to pay the award, totalling $1,500,000. This settlement of the Cerruti claim ended the rivalry.
