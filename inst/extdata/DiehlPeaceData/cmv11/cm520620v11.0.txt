CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3098 from Gibler 2018, in 1981 there were numerous Libyan raids on Sudanese territory as Libya was attacking rebels in Sudan. Sudanese forces and Libyan forces clashed. Coded civil war link because this was conncted to militarized rebels in Sudan, outside this dyad, and coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Somalia a party to this dispute.
