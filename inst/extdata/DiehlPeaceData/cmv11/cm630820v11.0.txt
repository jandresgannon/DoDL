TERRLINK: MID2762 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID2762 3 -- uncertain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2762 from Gibler 2018, in 1988 Iran attacked a Singapore-flagged ship during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran routinely attacked tankers carrying Iraqi oil during the Iran-Iraq War as a means of harming Iraq's economy. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute. Coded uncertain because this case involves Iran and Singapore, not Malaysia, so Malaysia is not a participant in this dispute.
