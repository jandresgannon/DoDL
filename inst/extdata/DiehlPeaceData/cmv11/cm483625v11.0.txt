PS-UPDATE2020:

PSNOTES: end date of rivalry is when Chad and Sudan sign N'Djamena Agreement on January 15, 2010. A rapprochement agreement between Chad and Sudan, signed January 15, 2010, marked the end of a five-year proxy war. The normalization of relations led to the repatriation of Chadian rebels from Sudan, the opening of the border between the two countries in April after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border, though attacks on civilians in the area continue. President Idriss Deby visited Khartoum, Sudan's capital, in February for the first time in six years; and in July Chad, a state party to the International Criminal Court, hosted Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, earning the dubious distinction of being the first ICC member state to harbor a suspect from the court.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4367 from cm narrative, in 2004 Janjaweed militia forces from Sudan crossed into Chad and attacked a village, raiding cattle. As they were retreating to Sudanese territory, Chadian military forces caught them and engaged in a firefight with the group. At that time, Sudanese military forces crossed over into Chadian territory and entered into the clash, giving the Janjaweed fighters time to retreat into Sudanese territory. Following several more incursions into Chadian territory by Janjaweed fighters from Sudan, France deployed 200 soldiers already stationed in Chad to the border between the two countries to help protect the territorial integrity of Chad. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Chad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4384 from cm narrative, In November 2004, Sudan accused Chad of conducting military flights over Sudanese border territory. In December 2004, Chadian military units pursued Sudanese rebels into Sudanese territory following a raid on a Chadian village by the rebels. Chad also declared that it would continue a policy of pursuing Sudanese rebels on Sudanese territory to protect its villages. In January 2006, the Sudanese government reiterated its claim that Chadian military planes were regularly flying over Sudanese territory. Finally, in February 2006, a Sudanese village came under artillery fire from Chadian territory. This artillery shelling was followed by a ground assault on the village by Chadian troops. The Chadian forces clashed with Sudanese military units and were eventually repelled from Sudanese territory. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Chad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4390 from cm narrative, On October 18, 2006, Chad reportedly struck several Sudanese military positions in Darfur with aerial bombings in support of SPLA rebels operating in the region. In response, Sudan threatened that, if the bombings did not stop, Sudan would counter-attack against Chadian villages. This threat was carried out in March 2007, when Sudan bombed villages in the Chadian regions of Gregni and Kariari. In early April 2007, the final incident of the MID occurred when Chad crossed the border with Sudan in pursuit of Chadian National Concord rebels. During the pursuit, the Chadian military forces clashed with Sudanese military forces near the town of For Baranga, which ultimately resulted in the Chadian forces returning to Chadian territory. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Chad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4395 from cm narrative, In the final days of 2007, Chad launched an attack, using both ground troops and war planes, against anti-Chadian rebel bases near the Sudanese towns of Rijlal-Haraziya and Karmula in the Darfur region. Another aerial attack against rebel bases in the Darfur region occurred on January 7, 2008, and again against a rebel base near Ade, Sudan on January 28, 2008. In early April 2008, a Chadian military helicopter launched rockets at a Sudanese military installation in Um Tamjoob, but it is unknown why Chad suddenly attacked a Sudanese military position. In May 2008 the conflict escalated as Chadian and Sudanese military forces clashed in the Sudanese Kashkash region, with the Sudanese forces ultimately repelling the Chadian attackers. On June 17, Sudanese military forces, including both troops and helicopters, attacked a Chadian military outpost in the Chadian region of Ade. Finally, on July 13, several Sudanese war planes flew over the Chadian town of Bahay, but did not attack any military or civilian positions. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Chad/Sudan.
