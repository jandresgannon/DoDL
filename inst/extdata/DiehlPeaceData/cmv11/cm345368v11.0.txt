Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 8/17/1998 and last day of dispute was on 8/26/1998.MID4186rivalry=345368 nationa=LITHUANIA nationb=YUGOSLAVIA-SERBIA MID4186 20000221-20000403  revtype1a=NOT APPLICABLE revtype2a=NOT APPLICABLE fatala=NONE fatalpa=0 lhosta=NO MILITARIZED ACTION  revtype1b=POLICY revtype2b=NOT APPLICABLE fatalb=NONEfatalpb=0 lhostb=DISPLAY OF FORCE This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia.
