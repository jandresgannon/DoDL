TERRLINK: MID68 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID68 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID68 is a multilateral MID, with US-DR and France-DR disputes making up this MID. Although the US warships were launched to discourage France from taking any further action toward DR, no threats were made and no military tension was apparent, so no MID was recorded between the US and France on this occasion. Even if it had been, this would not have been considered a territorial or maritime MID since no claims were made by the US or France on DR. 

MARITMID: MID68 3 -- not maritime
MARITMID-CER: MID68 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID68 from cm narrative, the Dominican Republic defaulted on payments to France, and France responded by deploying warships to Santo Domingo. The US, in its own interests of the Monroe Doctrine and its business dealings in Dominican Republic, deployed its own vessels in the area, deterring France from taking any further action. Coded not maritime because no maritime dispute was present.

NARRATIVE-CM:

President Ramon Caceres of the Dominican Republic was assassinated on November 18, 1911. United States troops intervened on June 26, 1914. US troops intervened on May 5, 1916. The US established a military government on November 29, 1916, and Admiral Thomas Snowden was appointed military administrator on February 25, 1919. Presidential elections were held in March 1924, and Horacio Vasquez was elected president. A new constitution went into effect on June 13, 1924. Horacio Vasquez was inaugurated as president in July 1924. US troops were withdrew on September 18, 1924. President Vasquez was forced to resign as a result of a military revolt on February 23, 1930, and General Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina was elected president in a fraudulent election on August 16, 1930. General Trujillo Molina suppressed opposition to his government, forcing many political opponents to go into exile. General Trujillo Molina was assassinated by a group led by General Juan Tomas Diaz on May 30, 1961. Lt. General Rafael Trujillo, the son of the former dictator, took over as chief-of-staff of the Dominican armed forces in June 1961. The US government opposed the restoration of the Trujillio dictatorship, and deployed naval and marine units some three miles off the coast of the Dominican Republic as a show of force. Lt. General Rafael Trujillo resigned as chief-of-staff of the armed forces and fled the country on November 17, 1961. President Joaquin Balaguer assumed control of the armed forces, and declared a state of emergency. A seven-member provisional council of state was installed on January 1, 1962, and the US resumed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on January 6, 1962. The Dominican council of state was deposed by a military junta on January 16, 1962, but the military junta was deposed on January 18, 1962. Rafael Bonnelly was installed as chairman of the council of state on January 19, 1962. Presidential elections were held on December 20, 1962, and Juan Bosch Gavino of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (DRP) was elected president with some 60 percent of the vote. Juan Bosch Gavino was inaugurated as president on February 26, 1963. President Bosch was deposed in a military coup on September 25, 1963, and the US suspended diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. A military junta took control of the government, and appointed Reid Cabral as president on September 26, 1963. Some 2,700 Dominican soldiers led by Colonel Francisco Caamano Deno revolted against the government of President Cabral on April 24, 1965. The rebels seized the radio station and the headquarters of the army in Santo Domingo. The Cabral government collapsed on April 25, 1965 and Jose Rafael Molina Urena was named provisional president. President Molina Urena requested US military intervention on April 27, 1965 in order to restore order on the island. Some 500 US marines entered the country on April 28, 1965 to evacuate American citizens, and eventually some 32,000 US troops were deployed in the country. The OAS Meeting of Foreign Ministers authorized the establishment of the Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) on May 6, 1965. The IAPF, which was commanded by General Hugo Panasco Alvim of Brazil, consisted of 12,770 personnel (1,150 Brazilian troops, 25 Costa Rican military police, three Salvadoran troops, 250 Honduran troops, 164 Nicaraguan troops, 178 Paraguayan troops, and 11,000 US troops). Hector Garcia-Godoy became provisional president on September 3, 1965. Presidential elections were held on June 1, 1966, and Joaquin Balaguer of the Reformist Party was elected president. The IAPF was withdrawn on September 20, 1966. There were some 4,000 civilian and military fatalities during the conflict, including 48 US soldiers and IAPF personnel.

NARRATIVE-CR:

Since the Santo Domingo's independence from Spain, the United States has played an active role in its domestic politics. At the beginning of the 20th century, this active role resulted in a series of military interventions by the United States, including occupation from 1916-1924. Four mids during this period make up the rivalry in which the US justified intervention in order to maintain the integrity of the Monroe Doctrine along with providing stability to the region to protect American business interests.

In January 1900, France pressed claims for indemnities to be paid by the Domincian government due to crimes committed against French nationals. The Boismare-Caccavelli and Paradis claims were the most notable during this period and were originally agreed to be settled by Dominican President Heureaux in 1895. Heureaux was assassinated in 1899 and the payments on the idemnities were stopped, leading to the deployment of French warships in Santo Domingo. In an effort to secure a quick and non-violent settlement of the French claims, the United States sent the warship *Machias* to Santo Domingo, MID68. The French claims were subsequently settled at the end of January 1900.

In 1905, the US again intervened in Santo Domingo as a result of its debt crisis. On January 18, 1905 the US sent a special commissioner to assist the Dominican governement in re-establishing its credit and domestic order. Appeals by American citizens during this period for US protection from Dominican government officials led to the presence of US naval ships in Dominican waters, MID247. In January 1905, Santo Domingo and the US signed a treaty allowing the US to supervise Santo Domingo's finances in an effort to repay both American and European creditors. This led to the seizure of Dominican customs houses by US forces in order to repay the debts.

Despite these earlier efforts, continuing economic and political instability led to a ten year occupation of Santo Domingo by the US beginning in March 1914. This occupation clearly represented the culmination of efforts to end civil strife and bring domestic order to the country, MID69 and MID322.

The last two mids between the two countries occurred in December 1959 and May 1961.

On December 17, 1959 the Domincan Republic forced down a US C-47 on a flight from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, MID2867. The Dominican governmentclaimed that the air force pilot who fired warning shots to force the landing had made a mistake. The Domincan government immediately apologized for the incident.

On May 30,1961 General Trujillo Molina was assassinated by a group led by General Juan Tomas Diaz. Lt. General Rafael Trujillo, the son of the former dictator, took over as chief-of-staff of the Dominican armed forces in June 1961. The US government opposed the restoration of the Trujillo dictatorship and deployed naval and marine units some three miles off the coast of the Dominican Republic as a show of force, MID1801.

Lt. General Rafael Trujillo resigned as chief-of-staff of the armed forces and fled the country on November 17, 1961. President Joaquin Balaguer assumed control of the armed forces, and declared a state of emergency. A seven-member provisional council of state was installed on January 1, 1962, and the US resumed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on January 6, 1962. The Dominican council of state was deposed by a military junta on January 16, 1962, but the military junta was deposed on January 18, 1962. Rafael Bonnelly was installed as chairman of the council of state on January 19, 1962. Presidential elections were held on December 20, 1962, and Juan Bosch Gavino of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (DRP) was elected president with some 60 percent of the vote. Juan Bosch Gavino was inaugurated as president on February 26, 1963 and was deposed in a military coup on September 25, 1963, causing the US to suspend diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. A military junta took control of the government, and appointed Reid Cabral as president on September 26, 1963. Some 2,700 Dominican soldiers led by Colonel Francisco Caamano Deno revolted against the government of President Cabral on April 24, 1965. The rebels seized the radio station and the headquarters of the army in Santo Domingo. The Cabral government collapsed on April 25, 1965 and Jose Rafael Molina Urena was named provisional president. President Molina Urena requested US military intervention on April 27, 1965 in order to restore order on the island. Some 500 US marines entered the country on April 28, 1965 to evacuate American citizens, and eventually some 32,000 US troops were deployed in the country. The OAS Meeting of Foreign Ministers authorized the establishment of the Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) on May 6, 1965. The IAPF, which was commanded by General Hugo Panasco Alvim of Brazil, consisted of 12,770 personnel (1,150 Brazilian troops, 25 Costa Rican military police, three Salvadoran troops, 250 Honduran troops, 164 Nicaraguan troops, 178 Paraguayan troops, and 11,000 US troops). Hector Garcia-Godoy became provisional president on September 3, 1965. Presidential elections were held on June 1, 1966, and Joaquin Balaguer of the Reformist Party was elected president. The IAPF was withdrawn on September 20, 1966.

With the exception of the minor incident in December 1959, the main cause of conflict between the two states has in large part resulted from instability within the government of the Dominican Republic, with the United States intervening in an effort to introduce economic and political stability. It seems that the rivalry between the US and Dominican Republic really ended after the occupation in 1924, with the last two mids being isolated occurences. This assessment seems reasonable despite similar reasons for intervention in the last mid with the first four at the beginning of the century.

With the restoration of democratic institutions brought about by the occupation the United States maintained diplomatic relations and the rivalry withered away. Even with the instability in the early 1960s, OAS intervention and another effort at restorating democratic institutions has managed to prevent any new rivalry from emerging over the last 3 decades. 

19009999-1916050 0.25

A series of minor disputes and US intervention make this a lesser rivalry. Coding becomes .5 with occupation in 1916 as per other occupation cases.
