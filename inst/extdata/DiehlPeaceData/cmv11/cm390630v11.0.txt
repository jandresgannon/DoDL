NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Denmark and Iran is a byproduct of the Iran Iraq War. The mids that occur between Iran and Denmark are all connected to this larger conflict. All of the incidents are relatively minor and as such call into question whether this dyad should be considered a rivalry. In the first incident the Danish government was delivering goods to Iraq, dynamite, that the Iranian governemt seized. The second incident is similar in that the Iranian government seized a Danish ship in the Persian Gulf. The third incident involved the Iranian attack on a Danish oil tanker as a part of the tanker war within the Iran Iraq War. When the Iran Iraq War ends in 1988, the mids discontinue between Iran and Denmark. It is the end of the conflict between Iran and Iraq that bring about the end of the rivalry between Denmark and Iran. 

A Danish vessel carrying military hardware and explosives material to Iraq was seized by the Iranian navy as it passed through the Straits of Hormuz on 8/12/1981 MID3100. The Danish crew was unharmed in the incident. Iraq invaded Iran Sept. 22, 1981 to begin the 8 year Iran Iraq War.
