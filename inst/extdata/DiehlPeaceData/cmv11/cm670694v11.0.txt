PS-UPDATE2020: Becomes a lesser rivalry - On 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia along with Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates severed all ties with Qatar. The reason given was Qatar's "embrace of various terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at destabilising the region".As part of this campaign, the Saudi-led quartet closed off their airspaces, territorial waters and land borders to Qatar. Saudi Arabia also suspended Qatar's involvement in the Yemen campaign. Saudis were the lead of the four in taking action and are coded as a lesser rivalry, whereas the threshold for this category is not met for the other three states vis-a-vis Qatar
