The Afghanistan-Pakistan border was a source of tension for Pakistani forces and Afghan-American forces. In several instances, the Afghan military deployed additional troops to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to secure the frontier against incursions by rebels from Pakistan. These border troops periodically exchanged small-arms fire with Pakistani troops, but it appears the localized conflicts were simple exchanges of hostilities and not part of larger offensives. At the end of 2002, the US military became increasingly involved, deploying its own troops to the border with Pakistan and beginning direct attacks against rebels in Pakistani territory. First day of dispute was on 1/11/2002 and last day of dispute was on 1/30/2005.

This dispute consists of a series of 35 militarized incidents that are centered around the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes against the United States. In response to the terrorist attacks, the United States demanded that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden and expel Al Qaeda members that were operating and training in Afghanistan. 9/15/01 - the United States, Great Britain, and France deployed naval forces to waters near Afghanistan. The United States deployed 2 aircraft carriers, Great Britain deployed 6 warships, and France deployed 2 warships. In response to the American deployment, Afghanistan placed its forces on alert and deployed anti-aircraft weapons around Kandahar. Russia, which had experienced previous disputes with Afghanistan along the Tajik border, placed its forces along the Tajik border on alert and mass weapons and troops along the border in response to the rising tensions in the region. 9/17/01 - American president Bush issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leadership to turn over Osama bin Laden or face American military strikes. The Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden unless a series of unreasonable conditions were met (trial by Muslim judge, recognition for the Taliban, foreign aid for Afghanistan, etc.) 9/22/01 - An American reconnaissance drone is shot down over Afghanistan. During this time, Great Britain began deploying special forces to Afghanistan 9/25/01 - British prime minister Tony Blair issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leaders to face military action if they do not turnover Osama bin Laden and shutdown the terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. 9/30/01 - The United States continued to increase the pressure on the Taliban by continuing to deploy forces to the region. In addition to the naval forces already deployed, the United States also sent ground forces to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and sent the USS Kitty Hawk carrier group to the region. The Taliban responded to the increasing American pressure by conducting exercises along its border with Pakistan. During this period of time Taliban forces also fired on a Russian border post along the Tajik-Afghan border. Russian forces suffered no casualties in the clash and returned fire at the Taliban forces. No information was given regarding Afghan casualties. Early October, 2001 - The British government issued a series of statements threatening military action against Afghanistan if the Taliban did not turn over Osama bin Laden. 10/6/01 - Afghanistan threatened war against Uzbekistan if the United States launched attacks from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan also began redeploying forces to its border with Uzbekistan. In response, Uzbekistan began deploying its forces along the border with Afghanistan. Reports also indicate that Afghanistan fired at an unmanned American drone conducting reconnaissance. As conditions deteriorated, Tajikistan placed its forces along the border on alert. 10/7/01 - American and British strikes on Afghanistan began. The first strikes involved attacks from cruise missiles, bombers, and missiles and initial targets were confined to airfields, command and control centers, military installations. 10/9/01 - NATO redeploys its naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the conflict in Afghanistan. Ships from Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and the United States participate in the redeployment. 10/10/01 - Following three days of sustained attacks, bombing targets began to include strikes against troops. Near this time, American and British forces began bombing Taliban forces positioned north of Kabul. These strikes involved the use of heavy cluster bombs and were likely to inflict heavy casualties on Taliban forces. These bombing strikes continued on a daily basis into November 10/16/01 - A Taliban gunman fired at a border picket occupied by Russian troops along the Tajik border. There were no Russian casualties in the attack. 10/17/01 - Reports indicate that Australian troops are now on the ground in Afghanistan conducted ground operations against Taliban and AlQaeda forces. 10/19/01-11/13/01 - US commando units began conducting ground operations within Afghan territory. These ground raids were used to attack Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces, flush them out for airstrikes, and for intelligence purposes. Two American soldiers were killed when their search and rescue helicopter crashed in Pakistan after a mission. These deaths are not counted in the dispute coding because they were accidental and did not result from military action. Allied airstrikes continue throughout this period. 11/13/01 - Russia "took additional security measures" along its border with Afghanistan. Taliban forces withdraw from Kabul and Northern Alliance troops take the capital. Because the Taliban has lost control of the capital, the dispute ends. First day of dispute was on 10/7/2001 and last day of dispute was on 10/9/2001.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Afghanistan and Pakistan disputed their border following Pakistan's independence from Britain on August 15, 1947. The Afghanistan government demanded that a plebiscite for self-determination be held in the region of Pakhtunistan that was inhabited by members of the Pathan (Pakhtun) tribe, but the Pakistani government refused this demand (a majority of the residents of the region had already voted in a referendum to join Pakistan on July 20, 1947). In March 1949, Afghanistan announced its support for the movement by Pakhtun tribesmen to establish an independent state in the region. Afghanistan mobilized troops near the disputed border on March 27, 1949. Pakistan military aircraft mistakenly bombed the village of Moghalgal in Afghanistan on June 12, 1949, resulting in the deaths of 23 individuals. The parties bilaterally resolved the crisis on July 31, 1949. Pathan tribemen declared the independence of Pakhtunistan on August 12, 1949, and Afghanistan recognized the independence of the region.

On February 1, 1981, the Afghan government issued a protest to the Pakistani government after the killing of an Afghan border guard at the Torkham border post.

MID3916 took place from February through April of 1989. On the February 15, 1989 the last of the Soviet troops to occupy Afghanistan withdrew. This left the leftist Afghan government to fend for itself against the relatively powerful mujahideen rebel forces. President Najib of Afghanistan accused Pakistan of massing troops along the border in preparation for an invasion and eventual annexation of Afghanistan. The rebel forces were based in Pakistan and the Pakistani government provided the mujahideen with support. This MID is not part of the historic rivalry between the countries over a separate Pathun homeland. 

MID4283 took place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. The Pakistani government aided the US and the coalition of states that brought down the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This MID is also not related to the MIDs over the Pathun homeland or the disputed border between the two countries. 

The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006. In the aftermath of the overthrow of the Taliban regime by U.S. and its allies, the relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan did not improve significantly. The Taliban regime was to a certain extent a creation of Pakistan's secret services and Pakistan's religious schools. In the aftermath of their overthrow Pakistan had to re-align its position as an ally of U.S. However, the resurgence of Talibans in the southern Afghanistan provinces led to recriminations from Kabul to Islamabad. Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's president accused Islamabad of training and arming militants to fight in Afghanistan. On the other hand, Islamabad accused Afghanistan of supporting the Baluchi guerillas and allowing for anti-Pakistani elements to fight in Waziristan (territory of Pakistan). The Afghanistan's claim on Pakistan's Pashtun territories persists and Kabul still refuses to recognize the Durand Line as the international border between the two countries.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Afghanistan and Pakistan concerns their mutual border and the ethnic group that the border divides. The Pathan tribe makes up the majority of the Afghan population. The tribe's traditional homeland is roughly split in two by the Durand line-a border demarcation line established by the British after the second Afghan War at the end of the 19th century. There are also a minority of MIDs over Soviet intervention into the Afghan civil war and the post September 11 attacks on the US. The primary issue motivating the rivalry is the Pathun homeland dispute. 

MID1307 occurred in the Spring of 1949 (March through June). After World War II Afghan King, Mohamad Zahir Shah denounced the Durand line. He promoted rebel activity in the Pathun region after the Indian partition in 1947. Afghanistan deployed air and ground units near the border as Kabul radio called for the Pakistani government to relinquish control of the area. In June of 1949, a Pakistani plane bombed the town of Moghulgai in Afghanistan. 

MID1306 occurred from June through October of 1950. On September 30 Pathun tribesmen invaded border areas of Pakistan. Small regular units of the Afghan Army supported the initial invasion. Afghan troops stopped supporting the invasion after the first day. Pakistani armed forces drove the invasion out by 5 October. 

MID2180 occurred in May of 1951. Pakistan accused Afghanistan of violating their mutual border. Pakistan claimed that 300 Afghan soldiers raided the village of Killi Walham in Baluchistan. 

MID1305 or the Kabel flag incident occurred from 3/29 to 5/4/1955. This dispute was also a part of the ongoing effort of Afghanistan to establish and independent Pathan state. The Afghanistan government issued a protest concerning Pakistan's decision to integrate the disputed territory into the province of West Pakistan on March 27, 1955, and the Pakistani government rejected the protest on March 28, 1955. Afghan demonstrators attacked the Pakistani embassy in Kabul on March 30, 1955, and Pakistani demonstrators attacked the Afghan consulate in Peshawar on March 31-April 1, 1955. Pakistan severed diplomatic relations and closed the border with Afghanistan on May 1, 1955. Prime Minister Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt offered to mediate negotiations between the parties on May 1, 1955, and Pakistan accepted the mediation offer on May 11, 1955. Afghanistan declared a state-of-emergency and mobilized troops near the disputed border on May 4, 1955. Prime Minister Nikolay Bulganin of the Soviet Union expressed support for Afghanistan on May 10, 1955. Prince Musaid Din Abdur Rahman of Saudi Arabia and Colonel Anwar Sadat of Egypt mediated negotiations between the parties from May 14 to June 28, 1955. The Afghan government lifted the state-of-emergency and demobilized troops near the dispute border on July 28, 1955. The countries bilaterally settled their dispute concerning the attacks against diplomatic facilities in Kabul and Peshawar on September 9, 1955.

MID2181 Pakistan alleged that Afghan soldiers fired on a patrol truck on the border. The report alleged that seven Pakistani soldiers were killed. 

MID1303 occurred in September and October of 1960. In March of 1960, the Soviet Union expressed support for the Afghan claim in the Pathun region dispute. This generated renewed tension between the rivals. In September both Pakistan and Afghanistan made mutual allegations of border violations. 

MID1304 occurred from May through September of 1961. Here Pathun Lahkars (a tribal group) raided Pakistani territory. These raids were on a much larger scale thatn any previous border incursions. Diplomatic relations were immediately severed. These incursions were made again in an effort to settle the long disputed Pathun dispute. 

MID2053 occurred between March of 1979 and April of 1982. This is the first MID in the rivalry to involve another state namely the USSR. Civil war broke out in Afghanistan in 1978. Government counterinsurgency efforts drove thousands of refugees into Pakistan. Over 400 border incursions were reported during this period. On multiple occasions there were instances of salvos between the armed forces of both countries. The USSR provided military assistance to the Taraki regime which was pro soviet. Soviet forces supported various pro soviet Afghan leaders and war continued between the USSR and Afghan mujahideen forces. 

MID2054 occurred between August of 1984 until March of 1985. The MIDs of 1980s were dominated by the armed conflict between the mujahideen and the Afghan and Soviet government forces. Consequently, the Afghan territorial claim against Pakistan was not raised officially during this period. Cross border raids into both Pakistan and Iran in pursuit of mujahideen rebels took place during this period. 

MID3916 took place from February through April of 1989. On the February 15, 1989 the last of the Soviet troops to occupy Afghanistan withdrew. This left the leftist Afghan government to fend for itself against the relatively powerful mujahideen rebel forces. President Najib of Afghanistan accused Pakistan of massing troops along the border in preparation for an invasion and eventual annexation of Afghanistan. The rebel forces were based in Pakistan and the Pakistani government provided the mujahideen with support. This MID is not part of the historic rivalry between the countries over a separate Pathun homeland. 

MID4283 took place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. The Pakistani government aided the US and the coalition of states that brought down the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This MID is also not related to the MIDs over the a Pathun homeland or the disputed border between the two countries.

SB-CR:
Afghanistan / Pakistan Years: 1949-Present. Issues at stake: Border between Afghanistan and Pakistan; Afghan support for rebels in Pakhoonistan; Pakistani support for rebels in Afghanistan during the 1980s. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 7. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1987. Wars: None. Summary: The rivalry between Pakistan and Afghanistan concerns their mutual border, and in particular Afghanistan's non-acceptance of sections of the Durand line which formed its eastern border with Pakistan since 1893. In particular, Afghanistan has called for either the incorporation of all Pathan tribes (Pakhtoons) into Afghanistan, or the creation of an autonomous or independent state of Pakhoonistan for those tribes. Britain initially planned to give the Pakhtoons their independence, but the Pakhtoon region was instead given to Pakistan in August 1947 after Pakistan's independence in June. The so-called North-West Frontier province was not fully incorporated into Pakistan. The first militarized dispute between Afghanistan and Pakistan occurred in 1949, marking the beginning of the rivalry. Border clashes in the early 1950s over Pakistani plans to incorporate Pakhoonistan, in the early 1960s, and in the early 1970s when Afghanistan supported the independence of East Pakistan (Bangladesh). Talks occurred at the same time as most of the incidents, but no resolution was reached. During the 1980s there were numerous border violations by both sides (for example, Pakistan reported over 400 border violations between 1979 and 1982), and disputes arose over Pakistan's support for rebels during the Afghan civil war and Soviet intervention. From 1986 to 1988, UN sponsored talks failed to reach any agreement on resolving the border dispute. However, in 1988 Pakistan, Afghanistan, the US, and the USSR did sign an agreement stating that outside forces would end their aid to internal Afghan factions in return for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan by 1989. There was no settlement of the border issue. The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006. In the aftermath of the overthrow of the Taliban regime by U.S. and its allies, the relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan did not improve significantly. The Taliban regime was to a certain extent a creation of Pakistan's secret services and Pakistan's religious schools. In the aftermath of their overthrow Pakistan had to re-align its position as an ally of U.S. However, the resurgence of Talibans in the southern Afghanistan provinces led to recriminations from Kabul to Islamabad. Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's president accused Islamabad of training and arming militants to fight in Afghanistan. On the other hand, Islamabad accused Afghanistan of supporting the Baluchi guerillas and allowing for anti-Pakistani elements to fight in Waziristan (territory of Pakistan). The Afghanistan's claim on Pakistan's Pashtun territories persists and Kabul still refuses to recognize the Durand Line as the international border between the two countries.
