NARRATIVE-CM:
A dispute involving the rights of British vessels to fish along the coast of Norway arose on June 2, 1906 when Norway approved a law forbidding foreigners from fishing in Norwegian territorial waters. The *Royal Norwegian Decree, *which was issued on July 12, 1935, laid down the rule "that whenever determining limits of our territorial sovereignty, this sovereignty shall be recognized as extending for four miles measured from the islands and islets furtherest from the mainland and not covered by sea." Britain objected to Norway's claim to exclusive fishing rights in certain areas in the North Sea, and submitted the dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on September 28, 1949. On December 18, 1951, the ICJ ruled that "the method employed for the delimitation of the fisheries zone...is not contrary to international law." Norway extended its fishing limits from four miles to twelve miles on May 13, 1960. British and Norwegian representatives held negotiations concerning the fisheries zone in Oslo and London betweem May 27 and September 28, 1960, when Britain agreed to recognize the 12-mile fishing limit. Norway agreed to allow British fishermen to fish within the zone for a ten-year transitional period.

Discussion:

The narrative above describes a fishing dispute, but not a MID. The two MIDs listed under this rivalry are not described, and so may have nothing to do with the fishing dispute. The dates for the MIDs also do not correspond with the dates of the fishing dispute
