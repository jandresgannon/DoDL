This RIV888 seems to refer to the Bulgarian occupation of Albania during World War I. Albania's territory was split between the two major alliances, and Bulgaria occupied about 2/3 of the country. 

19181130-19390409

Albania ceased to exist as an independent state on April 9, 1939, as it was conquered by Italy.

Albania re-entered the international system on November, 29, 1944. Albania joined Comecon in February 1949 but decided to exit the organization in 1961, following the Soviet-Albanian split. 

On November 12, 1949, Albania ended the treaty with Yugoslavia, the last Eastern European state that decided to move towards Soviet Union's sphere of influence, and against Marshall Tito's Yugoslavia. On September 20, 1952, an Albanian anti-Communist newspaper complained that Bulgaria was assigned by Soviet Union in the role of Big Brother in relation to Albania, given the high number of Bulgarian specialists that were sent into Albania. 

Albania was one of the founding members of the Warsaw Pact in 1955 but decided to withdraw support in 1961 and fully withdrew in 1968 because of the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact member-states. 

On October 17, 1961, Nikita Khruschev, the leader of Soviet Union attacked the Albanian leadership for siding with China in the Sino-Soviet dispute, and eventually broke off diplomatic relations between Soviet Union and Albania in December 1961. Bulgaria, a staunch pro-Soviet state, also diminished its diplomatic relations with Albania around the same time, keeping its relationship below the ambassadorial level. Two days after Khruschev's death Albania sent an ambassador to Bulgaria on October 23, 1964.On September 21, 1968 Albania asked Bulgaria to get rid of Soviet forces on Bulgaria's territory.

The relationship between Albania and Bulgaria seems to parallel that between Albania and Soviet Union during the Cold War. Enver Hoxha, the leader of Albania was a strong Stalinist and later a Maoist, while Soviet Union from the 1950s onwards left behind Stalin's policies and had several disputes with China. Bulgaria, the Eastern European country that respected to the letter the decisions of Kremlin, seems to have followed exactly what Soviet Union wanted from it in its relations with Albania.

On February 15, 1993, Bulgaria and Albania signed their first friendship and cooperation treaty of the post-Communist era in a bid to stabilize relations amid the uncertainties. They are both equally concerned by rising tensions in former Yugoslavia that could engulf territories involving their ethnic kin or national interests were Albania and Bulgaria.

Albanian President Sali Berisha and Bulgarian head of state Zhelyu Zhelev, capping an official visit, sealed the treaty after two days of talks in the Albanian capital, Tirana.

"The treaty will create better conditions for the further extension of our relations in all the spheres," Zhelev said.

Berisha stressed: "We are determined to follow a cooperation and integration policy in the region."

They agreed to strengthen links by building a new highway from the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, to the Albanian Adriatic port of Durres, via the Macedonian capital, Skopje.

Bulgaria and Albania signed two agreements on economic and social cooperation on December 10, 1998, at the first day of Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani's visit here.

An agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and a two-year program on cooperation in science, education and culture were signed after Bulgarian President Petar Stoianov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov held separate talks with Mejdani, local media reported.

To build an oil pipeline from Bulgaria's Bourgas Port to the Albanian port of Vlore is part of the corridor project.

Bulgaria and Albania are to set up business promotion centers in Sofia and Tirana separately in a bid to promote their new business relationship, the Bulgarian news media reported on February 25, 1999.

This is one of the specific agreements reached by the Joint Intergovernmental Bulgarian-Albanian Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technological Cooperation at its first session which ended here on Wednesday. The two sides signed a protocol summing up accords on their new business relationship.

The two countries will establish a business council to coordinate their trade and economic relations, said Albania's Minister of Public Works and Transport Ingrit Shule. They will work to encourage contacts between small and medium-sized enterprises.

The two sides will discuss a resumption of the import of Albanian bitumen for Bulgarian industry.

Bulgaria will be supplying Albania with machines, plant, consumer goods and agricultural products, Bulgarian Transport Minister Wilhelm Kraus said.

A number of cooperation agreements on a variety of issues such as tackling organized crime and receiving joint funds from the European Union for infrastructure have been signed by the two countries in the 1990s.

A free trade agreement between Bulgaria and Albania was signed on March 26, 2003. A military agreement between the two countries was signed on July 21, 2005. 

As of 2006, about 40,000-50,000 persons with Bulgarian origin are living in Albania. 

Albania joined NATO on April 1, 2009.
