These confrontations were routine during the Cold War but not at the time of this dispute. Canada and the United States responded by moving fighters and AWACS radar planes to northern bases to counter what NORAD described as a "potential threat." Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon stated, "We would anticipate that, in the next few days, they [the Russians] might fly one or several of these planes through the Bering Straits and close to Alaska." Russia deployed its planes sometime in late November - we assume November 26; the United States and Canada deployed their planes on November 30. It is not clear how long these deployments lasted. There is no evidence of future discussions among the participants regarding Russia's military presence in the Arctic. More specifically, it is not clear whether Russia removed its planes from the Arctic or whether Canada and United States decided to allow Russia to conduct future such training exercises in the Arctic. First day of dispute was on 11/26/2000 and last day of dispute was on 12/00/2000.RIVNOTES: RIV127, MID4342 (1999) is added by MID3.02RIV125 deleted because MID258 does not appear in the COW dyadic 3.1 data or the Maoz 2.0 dyadic data. DATES (may not be accurate, see riv5.20all.cvs): 19390917 -19390929NARRATIVE-CM:SOURCES-CM:NARRATIVE-CR:SOURCES-CR:
