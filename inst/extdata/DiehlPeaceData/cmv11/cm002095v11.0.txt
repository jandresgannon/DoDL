CIVWARMID: MID2741 3 -- not civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID2741 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2741 from cm narrative, the US government was accused by Panama of inciting civil unrest, and arrested several US military personnel and charged them with sedition. The US did create extensive domestic instability, and in this MID they sent US troops to secure bases in Panama amid growing civil disorder. Coded not civil war because although the US was inciting civil disorder which eventually led to a US invasion and the toppling of the Noriega regime, a militarized rebel group did not form to oppose the government. The regime change came directly from US invasion, not a civil war/revolution.

CIVWARMID: MID3901 3 -- not civil war
CIVWARMID-CER: MID3901 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3901 from cm narrative, the US invaded Panama and replaced the regime with a friendly one. This was not during a civil war, but the US had intentionally fomented unrest in the country for years, and under the auspices of protecting its bases in Panama, had repeatedly sent in troops as civil unrest grew more intense. This was used as the justification for invading and toppling the Noriega regime as well. Coded not civil war because while the US had created extensive civil disorder that weakened the regime and provided a pretext for the US invasion, the domestic opposition did not feature a militarized rebel group.

NARRATIVE-CM:
United States troops clashed with Panamanian demonstrators near the canal zone on November 3-5, 1959. The US government protested the incidents to the Panamian government on November 3, 1959, but the Panamanian government rejected the protest on November 4, 1959. On October 1, 1961, President Roberto Chiari of Panama announced that he had formally requested the United States to revise the Panama Canal Zone Treaty, and to restore full sovereignty of the canal zone to Panama. After US students raised the US flag (and not the Panamanian flag) in front of Balboa high school on January 7, 1964, Panamanians entered the canal zone and attempted to raise their flag at the high school on January 9, 1964. US troops and Panamanians clashed in the canal zone on January 9-13, 1964, resulting in the deaths of four US soldiers and 26 Panamanians. Panama severed diplomatic relations with the US, and referred the matter to the Organization of American States (OAS) and United Nations (UN) on January 10, 1964. The five-member OAS Inter-American Peace Committee (IAPC) headed by Enrique Tejera Paris of Venezuela attempted to facilitate negotiations between the parties on January 11-28, 1964. The UN Security Council appealed for a ceasefire on January 11, 1964. Panama referred the matter to the OAS Council on January 29, 1964, and the OAS Council established a five-member conciliation commission (Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay) on February 7, 1964. The OAS conciliation commission arrived in Panama on February 11, 1964. The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) sent a three member commission of inquiry (India, Netherlands, Sweden), which was assisted by two staff personnel, to investigate possible violations of human rights by the US in Panama on March 2-14, 1964. The OAS conciliation commission issued a report on March 17, 1964, and mediated an agreement between the countries on April 3, 1964. Panama and the US resumed diplomatic relations on April 4, 1964. Panama and the US signed the Treaty on the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal on September 7, 1977, which provided for the return of the canal zone and canal to Panama. The US-administered canal zone was returned to Panama on October 1, 1979, and the canal was returned to Panama on December 31, 1999.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The conflicts between the US and Panama do not really constitute a rivalry. As the following narrative illustrates, the last two disputes are clearly related but separate from the first two disputes.

On February 28, 1921 US troops entered Panama to guard the presidential palace amid civil unrest and protests, MID158. On May 5, 1976 a Panamanian gunboat ceased two US tuna boats in the Canal Zone and fined each $100,000 for illegal fishing, MID2957. The two ships were released on May 6, 1976. On September 29, 1987 Panama's legislature passed a resolution accusing the US of threatening Panama and inciting protests. On October 7, 1987 nine US military personnel were arrested for alleged participation in seditious activity, characterizing a period of consistent harassment of US military and diplomatic personnel by Panama beginning in September 1987, MID2741. From April 5-7, 1988 the US began sending additional troops to Panama to further secure its bases, due to increasing instability, MID2741. On December 20, 1989 the US invaded Panama to overthrow the Noriega government, MID3901.
