TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4523 from cm narrative, Iran moved four battalions of troops to its border with Iraq in the event of a US pullout from Iraq (MID4273), which would leave a security vacuum in the region. It is not immediately clear if the battalions were deployed to seal the border defensively, or if they would be used in an offensive capacity to move into Iraq following a US pullout. In August 2004, Iraq deployed additional forces to its border with Iran to prevent incursions into the country and smuggling. On January 5, 2005, Iraq seized two Iranian border guards on the two states' shared border. After an Iranian protest of the incident, Iraq released the two Iranian troops. Coded not third party link to territory because the US-Iraq War was not over territory, but was rather a regime change issue.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4205 from cm narrative and Gibler 2018, This dispute involves three military incidents between Iran and Iraq. On September 29, 1997, Iran bombed rebel bases (the MKO) inside Iraq. Iraq responded by flying planes over the area, in violation of the US imposed No Fly Zones. No further incidents were recorded regarding the rebel group. In November of 1997, the Iraqis siezed an Iranian fishing crew after their boat sank on the Iraqi side of the Shattol-Arab River. Iran protested in April 1998, saying the crew had still not been released and demanded an explanation. This dispute should be viewed as evidence of continuing hostility between these two states. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Iraq.

In August 2004, Iraq deployed additional forces to its border with Iran to prevent incursions into the country and smuggling. On January 5, 2005, Iraq seized two Iranian border guards on the two states shared border. After an Iranian protest of the incident, Iraq released the two Iranian troops.

This dispute entails several incidents between Iran and Iraq. In the first incident, Iran attacks on 7/27/1996 the Iranian rebel Kurds. Then, on 8/23/1996 Iran sent troops to Northern Iraq to participate in the battle between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic party on the side of the former. As a result, Iraq protests accusing Iran of violating its sovereignty by shelling residential quarters in the Kurds-controlled northern Iraq. Then on 8/26/1996 an Iranian boat containing four armed people in military uniform seized an Iraqi fishing boat. Later, sometime during September of that same year Iraqi Deputy PM sent a message to the UN claiming that Iran was massing troops and conducting military exercises on its border with Iraq.

This rivalry appears to be ongoing as of December 2006. The last MID recorded was MID4292 on June 10, 1999. The rivalry continued until the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. Border incidents regarding navigation on the Shatt al-Arab continued, but at a much lower level. The dispute over the waterway is still not fully resolved. In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and the ensuing violent conflict between Shiite and Sunni groups, Iran is often accused of helping militarily rebel/insurgent groups in Southern Iraq such as Muqtada al-Sadr's brigades. US's presence in Iraq also keeps the tension high between Iran and Iraq, even though the relations are friendlier, given the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Iran is mainly a Shiite state, and thus Iraqi's Shiite leadership has much better relations with Iran's theocracy.

NARRATIVE-CR:
There is a long history of tension between Iran and Iraq over many issues. There were traditional Arab-Persian tensions, Iranian support for Kurds who resisted Iraqi repression, Iranian opposition groups operating from within Iraq, and Iraqi efforts to resist Iranian influence in the Persian Gulf. 

One major source of conflict between Iran and Iraq has been their longstanding territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway (Iranian-Arvand River). This river forms the border between the two states for about 60 miles. The river flows into the Persian/Arabian Gulf and took especially important significance for both counties particularly in light of the development of both countries oil industries. 

All but one of the MIDs that take place between Iran and Iraq are bilateral. The only exception is a one day MID in which Iran expressed diplomatic support for Kuwait's Independence in MID122 in 1961. 

The dispute over sovereignty of the Shatt al-Arab has a long history dating back to the 17th century. Though there were many attempts to settle the issue by various treaties it was had not been resolved in the early part of the 20th century. (MID2103) Iran and Iraq renewed their dispute when Iraq achieved its independence from Britain on October 3, 1932. In 1934, Iran and Iraq engaged in fighting over the sovereignty of the Shatt al-Arab. In 1934, the League of Nations was brought into the dispute on an Iraqi initiative and urged Iran and Iraq to negotiation directly. Little progress was made towards reaching an agreement. In 1935, Persia accepted an 1847 treaty delimiting the border. In 1936, the attitude of Iran and Iraq toward one another shifted following the Italian attack on Abyssinia. In 1937, Iran and Iraq signed an agreement on their border problems, paving the way for the signing of a friendship and nonaggression pact between Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Afghanistan. 

This agreement and the Italian attack seems to have served to settled the dispute for a time. World War II takes place as well but in its aftermath the dispute resurfaces. In the 1950s, Iran and Iraq engaged in three MIDs (MID2103, MID2104, and MID1138.) All three MIDs were border clashes and tensions over the still disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway. 

In the 1960s, the rivalry over the Shatt al-Arab continued with several MIDs (MID2105, MID2107, and MID1136.) In April of 1969, Iran declared that it no longer acknowledged earlier agreements delimiting the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Iraq responded by claiming sovereignty over the entire river up to the Iranian border. Iraq threatened to take action against any Iranian vessel in the river. The territorial issue between the two countries was complicated by another issue. 

In the 1960s another element to the rivalry was added. Iranian sympathies for and support of Iraqi Kurds was added (MID2106 and MID2108.) The Kurds have been trying to secede from the four countries they occupy since the 1920s. Open warfare erupted between the Kurds and the Iraqi Army in 1961. The conflict continued for much of the 1960s. During the conflict, Iraq made frequent sorties into both Iran and Turkey in efforts to combat the Kurds. Iran was sympathetic to the Kurdish opposition. 

In the 1970s, relations between the two countries worsened as Iran seized Abu Musa and Tunb Islands in the Straits of Hormuz MID1135. Iraq broke of diplomatic relations with Iran and forcibly expelled eleven thousand Iranians living in Iraq (MID2105 and MID2110.) From 1972 until 1975 (MID2111 and MID2112), numerous border incident and low intensity fighting continued. This fighting was primarily a continuation of the territorial dispute over their border. In early 1974, Iraq launched a ground offensive in an attempt to seize full control of various disputed areas. Iran launched a counteroffensive and sporadic artillery exchange persisted until February of 1975. Additionally, there were more MIDs related to Kurdish resistance and Iranian support for the resistance or Iraqi pursuit of Kurdish targets in Iran (MID1134 and MID2113.) 

In the 1980s the most significant and obvious conflict between Iran and Iraq was the Iran-Iraq War (MID2115). Domestic revolt drove the Shah out of Iran by December of 1978. Ayatollah Khomeini dominated the succeeding government and an Islamic Republic was proclaimed in the spring of 1979. Iranian Kurdish separatists began operations against the Khomeini regime in 1979. These operations and attacks began around the same time within Iraq. This initiated Iraqi air attacks against Kurdish targets within Iraq and Iran. Saddam Hussein took power in a 1979 and Iraqi attacks on Kurdish targets increased. Iraq began raids into Iranian territory in the spring of 1980. Iran countered with air attacks deep into Iraq. The war that followed was a lengthy and costly one. Iran often used lightly armed `human waves' of infantry. Iraq used World War I era chemical weapons. In 1984, the fighting spread to the Gulf as Iraq struck Iranian oil targets on Kharg Island. The fighting ended in the summer of 1988 with the assistance of the United Nations. 

Iran and Iraq bilaterally agreed to a settlement of the territorial dispute on November 16, 1990. Iraq agreed to accept the 1975 agreement which had established the border in the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, and agree to withdraw its remaining troops from Iranian territory. Iran agreed to return the remaining Iraqi prisoners-of-war. The ICRC assisted with the repatriation of some 80,000 Iranian and Iraqi prisoners-of-war from August 1990 to May 1993.

Despite the settlement to the Shatt al-Arab waterway dispute, hostility between Iran and Iraq continued in the 1990s. MID3566 occurred from April until September of 1992. Here there were a series of issues. First, Iran bombed insurgent camps located in Iraq. These were Kurdish separatists agitating against the Iranian regime but conducting missions from within Iraq. A second issue was the refusal of Iran to return planes flown to Iran for safe keeping during the Gulf War of 1991. 

MID 4072 occurred from May through July of 1993. Here there were a series of incidents that involved Iranian attacks against Kurdish separatists in Iraq. On May 25th, Iranian military planes attacked two opposition guerrilla bases inside Iraq in retaliation for sabotage raids. On June 24th, the Iraqi military mobilized along the Iranian border and put its air defenses on high alert in apparent fear of an Iranian attack. 

MID 4192 occurred from July of 1996 until January of 1997. And MID4205 occurred from September of 1997 until April of 1998. These MIDs were consistent with other issues in the 1990s. There were Iranian opposition groups operating from within Iraq. Iran flew air missions targeting these opposition groups. Iraq responded with air defenses and with air operations. There is also the lingering issue of the return of military and civilian aircraft flown to Iran during the Gulf War to prevent damage to these Iraqi planes. The Iranians then did not return the planes. 

This rivalry appears to be ongoing as of December 2006. The last MID recorded was MID4292 on June 10, 1999. The rivalry continued until the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. Border incidents regarding navigation on the Shatt al-Arab continued, but at a much lower level. The dispute over the waterway is still not fully resolved. In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and the ensuing violent conflict between Shiite and Sunni groups, Iran is often accused of helping militarily rebel/insurgent groups in Southern Iraq such as Muqtada al-Sadr's brigades. US's presence in Iraq also keeps the tension high between Iran and Iraq, even though the relations are friendlier, given the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Iran is mainly a Shiite state, and thus Iraqi's Shiite leadership has much better relations with Iran's theocracy.

SB-CR:
Iran / Iraq Years: 1953-Present. Issues at stake: Border, especially control of the Shatt al-Arab waterway; support for Kurdish rebels in the other. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no accepted settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 11. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1988. Wars: 1980-1988. Summary: The original border between Iran and Iraq was set by the treaty of Erzerum in 1847, with a related protocol in 1913. The 1913 protocol gave Iraq navigational rights up to the Iranian bank of the Shatt al Arab waterway. Iran claimed that both the treaty and the 1913 protocol were illegal because they had been forced on Iran and Iraq by the Great Powers, and never ratified them. In 1934 fighting broke out along the disputed waterway, and in 1937 both states signed a new treaty (slightly more favorable to Iran than the 1913 agreement) under the guidance of the League of Nations. This treaty was ratified by both Iraq and Iran, and neither side made further claims, and Iran and Iraq enjoyed generally good relations, until the 1950s. Hostility rose beginning in 1951 and 1952 when both states began to issue protests about allegedly hostile actions undertaken by the other (regarding the border, support for anti-regime demonstrations, and British access to the Middle East). A militarized dispute over a border violation occurs in 1953, which is taken as the beginning of the rivalry. In 1957 Iran and Iraq attempted arbitration over the border, but the attempt failed when the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in Iraq in 1958 and Iraq completely renounced the 1937 treaty. More extensive fighting along the border broke out starting in 1959. Disputes over the Shatt al Arab continued through the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, a new set of issues arose with the discovery of oil in the Persian Gulf and conflicting claims to islands off Iran and Iraq. Additionally, both states gave aid to Kurds inside the other in attempts to foment Kurdish uprisings. Another agreement was signed in 1975 (the Algiers Accord), but was short lived. After the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, escalating fighting in 1979 and 1980 led to the Iran-Iraq war, which continued until 1988. At the start of the war Iraq officially abrogated the 1975 agreement and claimed control over the entire Shatt al-Arab. No comprehensive border settlement has yet been reached. Notes: 1) The Jones (1991) coding for the Iran-Iraq rivalry has it beginning in 1934; the COW dispute data set has a dispute in 1934 and 1935 in which fighting occurs over the border issues. After mediation by the League of Nations, Iran and Iraq signed a treaty of peace and friendship in 1937, along with border treaties and a broader treaty of friendship and non-aggression including Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Afghanistan. Relations were generally cooperative until the early 1950s, with apparently no claims being issued regarding the border. Because the 1934 dispute is isolated, and because both sides seemed to accept the border for more than 15 years after the 1937 treaty, I do not code it as the beginning of the rivalry, but use the first of several closely connected disputes in 1953. During the buildup to the war between Iraq and the United States, Iraq and Iran signed a peace treaty ending their war and accepting a new border. It remains to be seen whether or not it will hold. 

This rivalry appears to be ongoing as of December 2006. The last MID recorded was MID4292 on June 10, 1999. The rivalry continued until the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. Border incidents regarding navigation on the Shatt al-Arab continued, but at a much lower level. The dispute over the waterway is still not fully resolved. In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and the ensuing violent conflict between Shiite and Sunni groups, Iran is often accused of helping militarily rebel/insurgent groups in Southern Iraq such as Muqtada al-Sadr's brigades. US's presence in Iraq also keeps the tension high between Iran and Iraq, even though the relations are friendlier, given the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Iran is mainly a Shiite state, and thus Iraqi's Shiite leadership has much better relations with Iran's theocracy.
