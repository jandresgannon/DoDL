NARRATIVE-CR: Oman is considered to have become a member of the international system by the COW System Membership Dataset on October 7, 1971. The rivalry was initiated before Oman became a member of the system and continued after 1971. The issue that motivated the rivalry between the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen and Oman was Yemeni support for a leftist insurgency movement within Oman. Rights over the Kuria Muria Islands, located off the Dhofar coast (the province of Oman in which the insurgents lived and operated) were also disputed. The rebel province of Dhofar in the south of Oman had been a problem for the Omani government since the 1960s. The British government aided the Omanis in counterinsurgency operations in the years leading up to this rivalry. The Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen was a socialist state. In the 1970s, the PDRY attempted to export Marxist revolution to Oman and the Yemen Arab Republic. In 1972, Omani rebels in Dhofar formed the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arab Gulf (PFLOAG) and launched a leftist guerrilla campaign against the Omani government with the support of South Yemen. In May of 1972, the Omani government began attacking PFLOAG camps and positions within South Yemen. South Yemen retaliated with artillery strikes on Omani positions. During this phase in the rivalry, S. Yemen advocated Marxist economic and foreign policies of direct confrontation to Oman. 

MID1104 occurred in May of 1972. South Yemen troops shelled the Omani border post of Habrut on May 5-6, 1972, resulting in the deaths of ten Omani soldiers. Omani military aircraft attacked positions in South Yemen on May 6, 1972. Omani troops attacked a South Yemen military post near Hauf on May 24, 1972.

MID1105 occurred on November 18, 1973. Oman announced that one of its military posts in western Oman had been attacked by South Yemen planes.

MID1106 occurred from November of 1975 until March of 1976. Omani forces attacked South Yemen artillery positions-which had fired upon Omani troops during an attack against PFLO rebel supply lines near the border-on November 21, 1975. Saudi Arabia facilitated the signing of a ceasefire agreement by representatives of Oman and South Yemen, and the ceasefire agreement went into effect on March 11, 1976.

After the main period of fighting in the rebel insurgency in Dhofar ended in 1975-76, steps to reduce tension between S. Yemen and Oman increased. Several factors contributed to the successful mediation of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the particular efforts of the UAE and Kuwait. First, there was a shift in political climate in Aden. Economic difficulty forced the Yemeni leader Rubay to seek financial aid from rich Gulf States in the mid 1970s. Thus, he steered a course that was more moderate towards western leaning Gulf States. In 1980, Ali Nasir Muhammad took control of Yemen. He advocated more moderate approaches to both domestic and foreign policies. Specifically, he was more open to communication with Oman and with pragmatically settling the dispute with Oman. Thus, Yemen officially abandoned its policy of confrontation with Oman. 

The rapprochement collapsed in 1980 after the Omani government agreed to make military facilities available to the United States. Oman reported a number of border incidents in 1981 and this lead to renewed efforts by Kuwait to mediate. In December of 1981, South Yemen claimed that Oman had conducted a helicopter raid on a border village and abducted some South Yemeni citizens. 

There were also other incidents in the period following Muhammad's ascension to power. In November of 1982, the Supreme Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council arranged a series of meeting with the rivals. The outcome of this interaction was an agreement on normalizing relations. On October 27, 1982 Oman and S. Yemen signed an agreement of good intent. The following month Oman participated in joint exercises with US forces. This was strongly criticized by South Yemen as a show of force in the region MID3613 which occurred from December 3-7, 1982.

In January of 1983, Oman proclaimed an amnesty for former rebels who had fled to South Yemen. The border committee held two meeting during 1983. During October of 1983, the Omani and South Yemeni governments declared that they had agreed to establish diplomatic relations and would exchange ambassadors. In January of 1985, the first official South Yemeni visit took place since the deterioration of relations in the 1960s. In the spring of 1987, the border committee met and the two countries released a statement noting `discussions on the question of the border between the two countries continued in a cordial and fraternal atmosphere.' In October of 1987, there were further border clashes. These clashes were quickly resolved. Subsequent to 1987 the two countries met on several occasions and worked out mutually satisfactory agreements on their border dispute and other issues. 

In sum, the termination of the rivalry between S. Yemen and Oman was due to a number of factors coming together. S. Yemen experienced economic difficulties. Leaders in the state were forced to open up to aid and influence from western leaning Gulf States like Kuwait and the UAE. These economic difficulties coupled with other issues led to the rise to power of Ali Nasir Muhammad. He chose a path of moderation towards Oman. These factors combined led to the eventual relaxation of hostilities between the rivals.

On October 27, 1982, Oman and S. Yemen signed an agreement of good intent. The last MID of RIV1278, MID3613 occurred from December 3-7, 1982. Oman and South Yemen established diplomatic relations on October 27, 1983, after 16 years of friction during which the oil-rich sheikdom accused its Marxist-oriented neighbor of backing Omani rebels. The announcement marked another step in the effort of the wealthy Persian Gulf states to woo the Aden regime to their side. The date was chosen to fall on the first anniversary of an agreement of good intent signed Oct. 27, 1982, in Kuwait. Oman and South Yemen have not had diplomatic relations since South Yemen gained independence from Britain in 1967. South Yemen has long been accused of supporting rebels in Oman's Dhofar region. The announcement read over Radio Oman said the exchange of ambassadors was part of last year's agreement and "emanated from the desire of the two countries to develop brotherly and good neighborly relations in the shadow of fruitful cooperation between the two countries." The committee established in 1982 to define the borders between the countries is to hold its second meeting in Kuwait later in October 1983.

In a statement published in the 14th May, 1984, 'Uman' and reported by Muscat radio, the Deputy Prime Minister for Legal Affairs, Fahd Bin Mahmud Al Bu Sa'id, said dialogue was continuing between Oman and South Yemen. Relations were ''dominated by a good atmosphere and a mutual desire to preserve their natural course''. The exchange of diplomatic representation would come in time and would improve relations in the interests of the two peoples.

Omani head of state sultan Gaboos expressed satisfaction over his country's border talks with South Yemen which were held in Muscat in January 1985. `I am fully satisfied with the outcome of the Omani-South Yemeni dialogue which resulted in a mutual understanding of the border issue," Gaboos said. On 20th April, 1985, the Oman agency reported that Oman's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs had received South Yemen's Ambassador to the UAE, who had handed him a written message from South Yemen's Foreign Minister containing South Yemen's approval of Oman's proposal on the exchange of ambassadors. Yousuf al-Alawi Abdullah, minister of state for foreign affairs of the sultanate of Oman, praised the continuous development of the relations between Oman and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen on June 8, 1985. Speaking in an interview with the newspaper "Oman" al-Alawi said: "the relations with our brothers in South Yemen are very good." He said that the establishment of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level between the two countries is an outstanding step. He disclosed that the two countries will exchange ambassadors after some necessary preparations. Referring to the border talks between the two countries, he said: "this matter is not complicated. Only some technical problems have to be discussed in detail." Oman and Democratic Yemen had been hostile to each other. After good offices made by the gulf cooperation council through Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, both sides agreed to normalize their of relations in 1983. 

On February 4, 1986, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen was determined to cement the existing fraternal relations with the sultanate of Oman. The stance was expressed by the visiting South Yemeni communications minister Saleh Abu Bakr in a communique issued following a meeting between the South Yemen's minister and Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef bin Alawi. Abu bakr, who is also politburo member of the ruling socialist party of South Yemen, arrived in Muscat carrying a message from his country's interim president, Prime Minister Heidar Abu Bakr Attas to sultan Gaboos of Oman. He said that the new leadership in Aden would adhere to "the agreement of principles" signed with Oman in 1982 to reconcile political and border differences between the two neighboring countries. The South Yemeni minister affirmed that Aden was keen on maintaining reconciliation with Muscat on all levels, including meetings for a committee on border demarcation. Bin Alawi, for his part, reciprocated the desire to see relations between Aden and Muscat bolstered, according to the communique. Omani minister of state for foreign affairs Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah returned to Muscat on June 18, 1986, from a three-day visit to the Democratic Yemen where he delivered a message of Oman sultan Gaboos to Yemeni presidnet Haider Abu Bakr Alattas. According to a report from Muscat, capital of Oman, Alawi told reporters that during his stay in Aden, he and his Yemeni counterpart had discussed the situation in the gulf region and the Arabian Peninsula. The two sides reaffirmed their adherence to the principles of neighborliness and non-intervention in others internal affairs. They also expressed their willingness to achieve a wider and closer cooperation among the countries on the Arabian Peninsula, he added. He said that they also discussed the situation on the Arab arena and affirmed the need for further actions to resume Arab solidarity in order to confront all the threats the Arab countries are facing. On bilateral relations, he said the two countries will take further positive steps to develop and enhance the existing relations.

Abdul Azizi Addali, minister of foreign affairs of Democratic Yemen, left on January 11, 1987, for an official visit to Oman at the invitation of Yousef bin Alawi bin Abdulla, Omani minister of state for foreign affairs. Addali said in a statement at the Aden airport that Democratic Yemen and Oman support steps leading to enhancing the co-operation between the two countries in economic, trade and cultural fields. Both sides will exchange views during their talks on efforts for strengthening safety and stability in the area, he added. The Arab and world situations and a number of issues of common interest will also be discussed in the talks, he added. Yoused bin Alawi visited Democratic Yemen on June 15, 1986. On January 15, 1987, Democratic Yemen and Oman announced that they will form a ministerial commission headed by the foreign ministers of the two countries to boost bilateral cooperation. This was announced in a communique issued at the end of the three-day visit to Oman by Democratic Yemeni foreign minister Abdul Aziz al-Dali. The two neighboring countries will also encourage exchanges of visits and meetings between officials of the two governments, the communique added. Embassies of the two countries will open separately in Aden and Muscat this year to upgrade bilateral diplomatic ties since their restoration of diplomatic relations in 1982. During Dali's visit, he was received by Omani sultan Gaboos. Dali also held talks with Omani officials on consolidating the region's security and stability. This visit was considered here as an important step taken by Aden to enhance its relations with its neighbor of Oman at the beginning of 1987.

At least 10 people died in a clash between border patrols of pro-Western Oman and Marxist South Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, diplomatic sources said on October 14, 1987. An Omani source blamed the encounter on a ''misunderstanding.'' Sources in the United Arab Emirates said eight South Yemeni soldiers were killed after an Omani patrol found a Yemeni patrol in Omani territory. Diplomatic sources in Muscat, Oman's capital, said several Yemeni soldiers and at least two Omanis were killed. ''It was a clash between two border patrols due to a misunderstanding, and there is no change at all in relations'' between the Arab neighbors, a Muscat source said. Diplomatic relations between Oman and South Yemen were restored in 1983 after more than 10 years of antagonism following a revolt by separatist rebels in Dhofar supported by the Marxist regime in Aden. Oman, aided by British and Iranian forces, suppressed the rebellion after a bloody guerrilla war. Oman's Sultan Qabous began a large-scale campaign to improve living conditions in the impoverished area. The latest trouble in the area started when a South Yemeni patrol was spotted inside Oman, sources said. The Omanis first suspected the South Yemenis were on a sabotage mission. But the Marxist government in Aden insisted its soldiers had lost their way while patrolling the remote border, they said. Last year, hundreds of Western residents were evacuated from South Yemen during heavy fighting that erupted when supporters of South Yemen President Haider al Attas overthrew a pro-Soviet regime. The Soviet Union subsequently recognized the new government. Diplomats in the United Arab Emirates said quick intervention by U.A.E. President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan helped defuse the latest crisis. Sheikh Zayed, who returned from a private visit to Oman, made urgent telephone calls to Sultan Qabous and South Yemen President al Attas, they said. The sheikh, currently chairman of a six-nation gulf cooperation council, discussed the incident with South Yemeni Information Minister Mohammed Ahmed Jarhoum, who delivered a letter from al Attas. Sultan Qabous received another envoy of al Attas, Justice Minister Abdel Wase' al Salam, who indicated the Omani leader had accepted the South Yemeni version of the killings, sources said. 

The demarcation of boundaries between Democratic Yemen and the sultanate of Oman will no longer be an outstanding problem, a high-ranking official of Democratic Yemen announced on October 30, 1988. Haidar al-Attas, chairman of the supreme peoples council of Democratic Yemen made the announcement in Muscat, capital of Oman, in an interview with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) newspaper "al-bayan." It is the first visit of a Democratic Yemeni top leader to Oman since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1983. Attas described failure to demarcate the boundaries between the two countries as a remnant of colonial rule in the third world, comparing it to "a buried mine that has to be defused." He indicated that this is one of the issues he would discuss with Sultan Qabous bin Said during his visit to Oman. He pointed out that the development of ties between Democratic Yemen and Oman are in favor of the two peoples. Oman and South Yemen signed in Muscat on October 30-November 1, 1988 two cooperation agreement. The first one refers to cooperation in the fields of justice, religious endowments and Islamic affairs while the second one refers to commercial cooperation. S. Yemen and N. Yemen reunited on May 22, 1990 under the leadership of N. Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh. 

Oman's state minister for foreign affairs Yousef bin Alawi bin Abdullah flew on September 2, 1991, to Sanaa for developing bilateral ties that had been interrupted by the merger of North and South Yemen and the gulf crisis last year. The official Oman News Agency quoted Alawi as saying he would hold talks with the Yemeni officials on various issues and work for bolstering bilateral ties between the two nations. Alawi added that he would also discuss inter-Arab relations and latest developments in the Arab world.

The Yemeni President declared on December 15, 1991, that `The border talks with our brothers in Oman are proceeding well; there are no problems or complications of any kind. We have informed our brothers in Oman that we approve the signing of a border agreement and we are waiting for them to set a date.'

19921001-19950602 Transition

In a rare example of a border dispute being resolved through diplomatic means, Yemen and Oman have finally reached a mutually acceptable formula for the demarcation of their borders on October 1, 1992. The 25-year-old border dispute between Yemen and Oman has finally been resolved and a comprehensive settlement agreed upon. Four sessions of talks held earlier in September in Muscat culminated in the formulation of an agreement which establishes the border between the two countries as a straight line extending from Ras Kharba on the Indian Ocean to the Saudi Arabian border. It is hoped that the agreement will be signed by the end of November, 1992. According to reports, the new agreement is a well balanced amendment of the 1965 agreement between the two countries. The blueprints accept the general demarcation of the 1965 deal but with more flexibility from the Omani side, which is giving up some land in return for peaceful and settled border relations. Oman is relinquishing its claim on a 49,000 km2 area of which it has been in de facto control since expelling members of the Dhofar revolutionary movement from the territory in 1975. A 24 km2 area in the triangle of the Hebort valley, which is of both economic and archaeological significance, will be handed over to Oman. The agreement is of internal importance for the Yemeni government, which has faced several attempts to prevent the deal with Oman being finalized. The main opposition came from members of the Mahra tribe who feared the agreement would involve giving up some 18,000 km2 to Oman. In the event, the agreement has granted the Mahra special rights, putting an end to their opposition and to the long, complex and expensive procedures they have to go through in order to cross the border. The two sides have agreed to set up land outlets on the border to regulate the movement of citizens between the two countries. At present Mahra citizens have to apply for entry visas for Oman and fly more than 2,000 km via Muscat simply to visit relatives on the other side of the border. The agreement also includes appendices on grazing rights in the border areas. Yemen hopes the agreement will be signed before the end of November, which would coincide with the preparations for the general elections in the country. Yemen's Under-Secretary of Information Muttahar Taqie told 'Al-Ahram Weekly' there would be no further rounds of talks. "The technical committees are about to finalize their work," he said. "There are no serious problems facing them, so the signing of the agreement will take place at the earliest time convenient to the two sides." According to Taqie, the agreement will boost Oman-Yemen cooperation in the fragile Gulf region. Observers believe that the important role played in the agreement by the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, especially the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, will enhance the Council's position in the region's security planning. Representatives of the two Gulf states attended most of the earlier rounds of talks, but not this month's session. The lesson of the Gulf war, which started as a border dispute, seems to have been learned by the Gulf officials, a foreign diplomat said.

On January 14, 1993, the Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has said that his government and people are full of admiration for the Sultanate's wise policies and rational approach to its relations with other states. Receiving the visiting Omani media delegation in Sanaa, the Yemeni leader hailed the Oman-Yemen relations and described them as "constantly growing and expanding thanks to our joint efforts and sincere determination to strengthen the ties of brotherhood between our two peoples and countries." He said that Oman and Yemen had enjoyed close relations since ancient times and that these ties had grown even stronger since the signing of the border accord. Answering a question from ONA's Sana'a correspondent, he said: "We would like to see all Arab border issues to be solved by dialogue and following our example. We and our brothers in Oman reached our border agreement through sincere brotherly dialogue." President Saleh said that the Oman-Yemen border accord had opened up new horizons of co-operation between the two countries and was a model for solving the frontier disputes between brotherly states.

On September 10, 1993, the Sultanate of Oman and Yemen signed two agreements on economic, trade, and technical cooperation and establishing a joint committee between the two countries. The agreement was signed on the Omani side by Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, the Minister of Commerce & Industry, while on the Yemeni side by Abdulrahman Abdulkader Bafadal, the Yemeni Minister of Provisions and Trade. At the Omani-Yemeni joint committee's first meeting held earlier, the two ministers headed the talks on behalf of their respective countries. The Omani side briefed the Yemeni delegation on the steps being taken to construct the Al Mazunah free trade zone on the Oman border with Yemen. Mr Maqbool Sultan said after the meeting that the two countries would open a sea route and a joint bank to be base in Yemen as well as establishing joint ventures in investments.

Sultan Qaboos of Oman arrived in Sanaa on October 2, 1993, on his first visit to Yemen for talks aimed at strengthening relations between the two countries, one year after they signed a border demarcation accord. In October 1992 Yemen and Oman signed the final agreement on their 300-kilometer (186-mile) common border, ending 10 years of negotiations. Later Oman decided to grant Yemen 21 million dollars in a bid to contribute to the construction of a road linking the two countries. The Gulf leader was met at the airport by President Ali Abdallah Saleh and several members of the Yemeni government. Omani officials said talks during the four-day visit would also cover the Middle East peace process and the situation in the Gulf.

Mohammed Salim Basendwah, Yemen's Foreign Minister and envoy of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, left on May 17, 1994, at the end of a two-day visit to the Sultanate. Before his departure he told Oman News Agency that during visit he had conveyed a message to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said from President Saleh. The message had been received by His Highness Sayyid Fahd bin Mahmoud Al Said, Deputy Prime Minister for Cabinet Affairs. Basendwah added that he had explained the realities of the situation in Yemen to HH Sayyid Fahd. He had found that both HH Sayyid Fahd and the minister of state for foreign affairs were concerned about Yemen's security, integrity and unity. Basendwah stressed that the Sultanate of Oman enjoyed the respect and admiration of all Yemenis. "The Sultanate has helped Yemen in the past and will unhesitatingly help Yemen in the future. There is nothing strange about this, because our two countries are neighbors with many brotherly ties and a common history that dates from the distant past," he said. He stated that he was happy with the results of his visit to Oman, adding "I hope that Yemen will always enjoy a strong, special relationship with Oman. I believe that Oman and Yemen can play an important role in this region in their dealings with their sister states in the Gulf." Asked whether any new ideas on stopping the bloodshed in Yemen had been put forward of officials in the Sultanate or any other Arab states he had visited, Basendwah said: "Every Arab hopes to see an end to bloodshed, not just in Yemen but throughout the Arab world. However, the current fighting in Yemen is the result of earlier events which must be dealt with first before the bloodshed can be stopped. I think that it is worth sacrificing lives for the sake of Yemeni unity, because it is a dream which has been realized." He added, "we share the anxiety of all our brothers about what is happening in Yemen and we agree with them on the need for a ceasefire at the earliest possible opportunity. However, what needs to be established is how to achieve it. We in Yemen are not prepared to go back to the polarization, anxiety and instability that characterized the period after the crisis began in August 1993. We want to see a new, stable, truly united Yemen with a single voice under a single government." The Yemeni Minister was seen off by Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ahmed bin Yousuf Al Harthy, head of the Arab department at the foreign ministry, Khamis bin Hamad Al Battashi, head of protocol at the ministry, and the Yemeni ambassador to the Sultanate.

Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh met with Omani officials on September 12, 1994, to repair relations strained by his country's two-month civil war. ''Saleh will ask the Omani leaders to play a crucial role in restoring Yemen's relations with the Gulf countries,'' a diplomatic source said. The Yemeni president talked with the Omani officials for about six hours before returning to neighboring Yemen. Local analysts believed that the president spoke of the alleged efforts by Gulf countries to reorganize the rebels that were defeated July 7. Saleh has said some Gulf countries armed the secessionists during the civil war and have created training camps for the former rebels. Saleh's trip is especially significant because Socialist Party leader Ali Salem al-Baidh, who led the revolt against Saleh's government, took refuge in Oman. ''Al-Baidh told the Omani authorities that he would not practice any political activities while he is in Oman,'' an official source said, suggesting Oman would restrain rebels attempting to reorganize in its territory. Al-Baidh, who was Saleh's vice president, is one of 16 leaders of the Socialist Party who have been charged with treason by Yemen. Marxist South Yemen and the conservative North Yemen united in May 1990, but differences between them exploded into civil war in May 1994. Oman has returned all the heavy weapons the defeated rebels brought with them when they crossed the border. The trip was Saleh's first outside Yemen since the end of the civil war. Busaidi said the decision by the two countries was a "courageous step" towards peace in the region.

Oman has returned to neighboring Yemen all arms and military equipment that had been smuggled to the sultanate by southern Yemenis fleeing the war in Yemen, it was reported in Muscat on September 17, 1994. The Omani News Agency (ONA) quoted a defense ministry spokesman as saying that the arms and military equipment, whose quantities were not disclosed, had been handed over to a Yemeni military delegation which arrived in Oman for this purpose. The arms were transported aboard Yemeni military planes and ships which left Oman for Yemen on September 16, 1994. Oman's move came a few days after Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh visited Muscat and held talks with Omani leader Sultan Qabus Bin Said. Among other things, Saleh was believed to have discussed with Qabus the fate of Ali Salem Al Beidh and other exiled southern Yemeni leaders who have fled to Oman and other Arab countries following their defeat in the two-month civil war between North and South Yemen which ended on July 7 with the fall of the strategic southern port city of Aden to army forces loyal to Saleh. Al Beidh and 15 other southern leaders have been excluded from the general amnesty declared by Saleh after the North's victory for all Yemenis involved in the war. Saleh, a northerner, has said his government was planning to ask Arab states to extradite four exiled southern leaders, including Al Beidh, to stand trial for "war crimes." Al Beidh, a southerner, was president of the secessionist state, the Democratic Republic of Yemen (DRY), he declared in Aden on May 21 after abrogating the uneasy four-year union between former Marxist South Yemen and the pro-west North. Following his defeat in the war, he was reported to have quit politics.

A 20-year border dispute between Oman and Yemen finally ended on June 3, 1995, in a ceremony in which 5,000 square kilometers of land changed hands, in the final stage of the 1992 agreement. The land, which has been under Oman's control since 1975, was handed back to Yemen. In return Oman acquired 24 sq km at Wadi Habrut, site of an ancient Oman castle dating back to the Portuguese colonial era. The ceremony at Habrut, in the Yemeni governorate of Al Mahrah, was held under the patronage of the Omani Minister of State and governor of Dhofar, Mussalam bin Ali Al Busaidi, and the governor of the Yemeni province of Al Mahrah, Hassan Makbool Al Ahdal, the Omani News Agency (ONA) reported. Negotiations for an agreement were made during the 1980s and advanced after the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990. In October 1992, a settlement was signed and ratified.

On May 27, 1997, Oman and Yemen signed a landmark international border agreement, paving the way to a new era of friendship and cooperation. Sayyid Sultan bin Hamed Al Busaidi, undersecretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Dr Mohammed bin Abdul Malik Al Alafi, head of survey department in Yemen, signed the agreement at a ceremony held at Al Bustan Palace Hotel. Both Sayyid Sultan and Dr Alafi presided over the Oman-Yemen Joint Technical Committee (OYJTC) for their respective countries. Sayyid Sultan and Dr Alafi said that the agreement was the fruition of the continuous efforts made by both the sides in four years. The first border agreement between the two countries was made in 1992. Dr Alafi added that both sides had to undergo various difficulties during the period leading to this historic signing. "(But) the OYJTC was successful in solving all the problems involved within the context of the mutual cooperation and bilateral ties between the two countries." His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh were the chief architects of this landmark border agreement, Dr Alafi said. He lauded the efforts made by the members of the OYJTC.

Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh arrived in Oman on December 14, 1997, for a visit aimed at promoting trade ties and re-launching his country's bid to join a six-nation economic and political alliance. Saleh was met at the airport by Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos. He was accompanied by a high level delegation, including ministers of foreign affairs, information, planning, and development. Saleh is expected to discuss trade and investment opportunities with Omani officials and a planned free trade zone in Al Mazyouna on the border between the two neighbors. Saleh is also expected to reiterate his country's wish to join the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member political and economic alliance of which Oman is a member, an Omani official said on customary condition of anonymity. The official said Saleh will explain Yemen's point of view ahead of the next GCC meeting that is scheduled to be held in Kuwait Dec. 20-22, 1997. Yemen sent its request for membership to a GCC summit in the Qatari capital Doha in December 1996. The request, which received preliminary approval from Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar, was not put on the meeting's official agenda. Saudi Arabia, the dominant power in the GCC, made no official comment on the Yemeni request. Kuwait, still angry over Yemen's perceived pro-Saddam Hussein stance after his 1990 invasion, expressed strong opposition. Yemen, a nation of 17 million with severe economic woes, wants easier access to the oil-rich Gulf economies by joining the GCC. It is the only country on the Arabian Peninsula that is not a GCC member. The GCC turned down Yemen's request to join in February 1997, on grounds there is too much disparity between Yemen and the rest of the group. Saleh was last in Oman in 1995.

On August 4, 1998, the Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf Bin Alawi has stated that the border agreement with Yemen is a final and international one, pointing out that it was also deposited with the United Nations and the Arab League. In a statement to 'Al-Sharq al-Awsat', the Omani foreign minister said that the border issue between Oman and Yemen ended after the clarifications Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal made during his recent visit to Yemen. He said that Saudi Arabia was planning to take a routine legal measure without doing harm to relations between the two sides. Bin Alawi added: I believe that the issue has ended at this point, and we were pleased when we learned that the two sides had taken specific measures to control any transgressions that may take place here and there. He also said that the new agreement between the two sides would put an end to all problems so that cordiality and cooperation would prevail in the Arabian Peninsula countries. Bin Alawi also said that the three parties, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Oman, were now in a situation other than that sought by the media organs, denying the existence of any outstanding problem between the three parties about the signing of the border agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and Yemen. He also said that the agreement signed by Yemen and Oman became an international agreement after it was deposited with the United Nations and the Arab League. Regarding the Saudi memorandum of protest against the border agreement between Oman and Yemen, Bin Alawi said that the Saudi foreign minister told the media organs in Yemen: "The matter is routine, and we view our agreement with Yemen as final."

The Oman-Yemen joint committee concluded its fourth session in Sanaa on September 21, 1998, under the chairmanship of Malik bin Suleiman Al Ma'amari, minister of housing and head of the Omani side at the meeting, and Abdullah Hussein Al Daf'ee, Yemeni minister of constructions and housing, head of the Yemeni side. Ma'amari said the joint session of talks helped in activating the economic and commercial cooperation between the two countries. He said relations between the Sultanate and Yemen cannot be evaluated by words but by work, adding that: "We have executed many of the earlier protocols and decisions to the benefit of the two countries and peoples." Abdullah Hussein Al Daf'ee, greeting the efforts of the members of the joint ministerial committee, said that the outcome of the meetings would contribute to increasing the trade exchange activities between the two countries and also promote the investors to contribute largely to the economic development. Al Daf'ee confirmed that there was continuous follow-up action to execute what has been agreed to in the last session. At the end of the meetings, they signed an agreement to encourage and protect investments between Oman and Yemen. They also signed a customs cooperation executive program project agreement.

The Yemeni Minister of Oil and Minerals Rashid Ba-Rabba returned on October 17, 2001 from Oman after few days visit during which he held talks with Omani officials. Upon his arrival, Ba-Rabba said that his visit was successful. He said that Yemen side had succeeded to know the Omani experience in field of oil and gas. Ba-Rabba said that he held official talks with both minister of oil and gas and minister of trade and industry on the possibility of broadening cooperation between the two countries in these spheres. He added that the Omani side welcomed the training of Yemeni cadres in Oman in field of oil and gas especially in terms of liquid gas. He said that the Yemen and Oman in this visit agreed to exchange geological and geophysical information about the border areas as well as on establishing a joint company to distribute oil derivatives and to build distributing stations on the way from Mahrah governorate to Oman during the coming days.

Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih received Yusuf Bin-Alawi, minister in charge of foreign affairs in the Sultanate of Oman, at the 22 May Palace in Aden on January 5, 2002. Alawi relayed to the Yemeni president a message from his brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, president of the 22nd session of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC summit. The message addresses the resolutions of the GCC summit recently held in Muscat pertaining to Yemen's accession to some of the GCC institutions and the mechanisms that will be used to implement these resolutions. Once again, the Yemeni president expressed his high appreciation for the efforts made by His Majesty Sultan Qabus and the leaders of the GCC member states, to ensure Yemen's accession to be a full member of the GCC. Yemen is currently, as of December 2006, in the negotiation process to join GCC. Yemen hopes to join GCC by 2016. 

Oman and Yemen signed an agreement on December 14, 2003, to define their maritime borders. "With this agreement, all the borders between Oman and Yemen have been defined," Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Kerbi told reporters at a news conference with his Omani counterpart, Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah. The two countries signed an agreement defining their land borders in 1992. Al-Kerbi said that this accord would solve all problems resulting from undefined sea borders. "This agreement," he said, "will help both countries to cooperate on security issues, coordinate economically and control their territorial waters." Omani officials told The Associated Press that al-Kerbi met with Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Saeed, who expressed his blessings for the agreement. Officials from both countries discussed other bilateral issues and regional developments, especially in Iraq, and anti-terrorism efforts.

The Yemeni Information Minister Husayn al-Awadi and his Omani counterpart Hamad al-Rashidi signed in Muscat on February 29, 2004, the official discussions' minutes on the media cooperation between Yemen and Oman. In statements to the Omani News Agency, Al-Awadi expressed his happiness for successful visit, calling for more direct cooperation and coordination between the information establishments in the two countries. The signing ceremony was attended by the Yemeni ambassador in Muscat, Abdallah al-Radi, and a number of media officials of the two neighboring countries. On April 16, 2004, the Omani general inspection assistant Staff Brig Muhammad bin-Abdallah al-Riyami and accompanying delegation has arrived in Sanaa to participate at the sixth meeting of the border authorities between Yemen and Sultanate of Oman. The Omani officials said that the meeting will discuss the security issues and exchange views between the two countries.

A session of official talks was held at the Interior Ministry on April 5, 2005, between the Sultanate and Yemen. The Omani side to the talks was led by Sayyid Saud bin Ibrahim al-Busaidi, Interior Minister, while Dr. Rashad Mohammed Alimi, Yemeni Interior Minister headed his country's side. The talks discussed a number of topics relating to developing existing cooperation and mechanisms to enhance the role of joint security committees. Then, the two sides signed the approval documents exchange of the security agreement between the two countries and the minutes of the border authorities meeting. The Yemeni Minister told Oman News Agency (ONA) that his visit to the Sultanate provided him with an opportunity to meet His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and listen to his invaluable directives, which will be implemented in the interests of the two peoples. He said the two countries leaderships shared keenness to further enhance bilateral relations in various fields. He added the signing of the approval documents exchange and the minutes of the border authorities meeting will help consolidate these relations. The talks and signing ceremony were attended by Sayyid Mohammed bin Sultan al-Busaidi, Interior Ministry undersecretary, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamoud al-Busaidi, Foreign Ministry undersecretary, Major-General Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Riyami, Assistant Inspector-General of Police and Customs for Operations, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Badi, Sultanates Ambassador to Yemen, the Yemeni Ambassador to the Sultanate, members of the official delegation accompanying the guest and officials of the Sultans Armed Forces and Royal Oman Police.
