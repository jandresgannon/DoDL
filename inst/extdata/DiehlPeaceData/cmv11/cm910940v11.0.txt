DYAD: PAPUA NEW GUINEA-SOLOMON ISLANDS
RIVALRY: RIV1375
DISPUTE(S): MID4075 MID4076 

PSNOTES: Solomon Islands becomes independent on 19780707 (system membership). 

The two states solve their maritime border in the 1980s and these disputes involve Bougainville rebels running across borders. The Solomon Islands are not really actively supporting the rebels and there is no territorial claim by SI. Thus, negative peace (.50) is right. There's no territory involved, and although there are civil war elements involved, it seems that the two sides are protesting the civil war ramifications/violations. Thus, there are a group of frequent MIDs, but it's not clear that the relationship between the two states drives the MID behavior.

MID4075

TERRMID: MID4075 3 -- not territorial 
TERRMID-CER: MID4075 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTE: MID4075 On 3/20/1993, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Solomon Islands border guards, under orders to do so from government, fired at low-flying Papuan airplanes (consistent with narrative). The Solomon forces were under standing orders to fire at PNG aircraft that violated Solomon airspace, and PNG aircraft (and, on other occasions, ground troops and boats) regularly crossed the border in pursuit of secessionist Bougainville rebels who make a claim on PNG territory and live on Solomon territory. (Sydney Morning Herald). However, the disputes in this MID are driven by pursuit of rebels (see CIVWARMID) and not by a territorial or maritime dispute (these were settled, per the rivalry-notes section). Coded not territorial because boundary was not disputed and although it was crossed, it was to pursue rebels and not to advance a territorial claim.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4075 On 4/6/1993, The Age reported an exchange of gunfire between PNG and Solomon forces that occurred on 4/5/1993, triggered by PNG forces crossing the maritime border. The PNG forces were stationed in Bougainville, the home to the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, a secessionist movement. PNG forces had crossed the maritime boundary in pursuit of Bougainville rebels in Solomon Islands. Coded not maritime because maritime boundary had been settled in 1980s (per the rivalry-notes), and this was not a challenge to maritime boundaries but was rather driven by secessionist rebels (see CIVWARMID).

On 3/20/1993, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Solomon Islands border guards,under orders to do so, fired at low-flying Papuan airplanes (consistent with cm narrative below) and the Solomon PM declared they had captured Bougainville rebels transporting arms by boat (does not appear to be boating incident in narrative below, but does involve secessonist rebels).

The origins of this dispute go back to 1988, when the Bougainville Revolutionary Army wanted to join Solomon Islands. The dispute is related to three consecutive militarized incidents between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The first incident (OC00003) is an exchange of fire between Solomon Islands ground forces based on Shortland Island and an aircraft belonging to Papuan Defence Force. The second incident (OC 00002) is about the landing of four Papuan soldiers on the Solomon Island of Ovau and their subsequent attempt to land on the larger Mono Island. The final incident (OC00025) is a sea clash off Bougainville Island between patrol boats from Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands on the eve of the resumption of border talks. First day of dispute was on 3/5/1993 and last day of dispute was on 4/00/1993.

This dispute is based on three incidents between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The first incident (OC 00006) is related to the incursions of the Papuan patrol boats into the Solomon Islands waters and their firing on a village in "hot pursuit of rebels from Bougainville" (according to the Papuan Prime Minister). The second incident (OC 00008) occurred when one of the Solomon Islands patrol boats forced a Papuan defense vessel to turn back in Solomon waters by firing warning shots. The final incident (OC 00007) is related to the illegal border crossings of Papuan Defense Force soldiers into the Solomons' territory. It is claimed by Solomon Islands that the Papuan troops crossed from Bougainville to Telube in the Shortlands, and crossed to Sasamungga in Choiseul Province. Papua New Guinea's military commander defended these incursions into the Solomons' territory by resistance forces on Bougainville that are allied to the Papuan army. He accused Solomon Islands border police of not cooperating with Papua New Guinea to keep the border sealed. First day of dispute was on 6/1/1996 and last day of dispute was on 11/29/1996.
