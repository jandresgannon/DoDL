TERRMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, this is a multilateral MID pitting US and Yugoslavia against USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the first few years of the Cold War. The tensions that led to this MID began when Yugoslavia and the USSR began to drift apart in terms of the ruling Yugoslavia Communist Party's willingness to acquiesce to Stalin's directives. The US observed the drift and tried to create an anti-Soviet state in the region by providing economic, food, and military assistance to Yugoslavia, and even attempted to bring Yugoslavia into NATO. Soviet troop mobilizations and border clashes occurred between Yugoslavia and Soviet-bloc states, including Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. The US and USSR are also included in this MID since they were rivals providing military assistance and/or orders, and the tension is tied to their rivalry. The US considered the USSR's and its allies' behavior threatening during this MID, and the USSR found the US's intervention threatening. Coded not territorial because Yugoslavia and Russia did not dispute any territory between them. This was connected to Cold War tensions.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, Stalin attempted to create domestic unrest that would result in an overthrow of the communist government in Yugoslavia and the replacement by a more USSR-friendly communist government. However, the domestic unrest did not result in violence or a militarized rebel group during this MID. Coded not civil war because no militarized anti-government group was present.

TERRMID: MID1703 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1703 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1703 from Gibler 2018, this is a Cold War MID that began when Yugoslavia began to pull away from Stalinist Communism in Europe. The Yugoslavian leader, Marshall Tito, began enacting and arguing for policies in the interest of Yugoslavia rather than the Socialist Union as a whole. In 1952, Yugoslavia fortified its border with Hungary fearing an attack, protested that Soviet airplanes violated its airspace, and accused Bulgaria of espionage. Romania accused Yugoslavia of violating their airspace, while Hungary protested that Yugoslavia destroyed two bridges linking their territories. Tensions eventually died down. Coded not territory because this was connected to Cold War tensions, and Yugoslavia and Russia were not disputing territory here.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3116 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, COW claims this MID occurs when Yugoslavia issues a threat of force to the Soviets after the death of Tito, but GML argue there is no evidence for this. Coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of "protecting" the ethnic Serbs there. UN/NATO countries are linked to this dispute.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 8/17/1998 and last day of dispute was on 8/26/1998.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. First day of dispute was on 2/21/2000 and last day of dispute was on 4/3/2000.
