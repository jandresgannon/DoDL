TERRMID-NOTES: MID4419 from cm narrative, A few days before 7/24/2003, Moldovan border guards captured a Ukrainian hydro-engineering facility at gunpoint. The facility is located in the middle of the Dniester River on the Moldova-Ukraine border. Moldova and Ukraine lack a border demarcation agreement. Moldova claimed that the facility was in its territory. It insisted that any demarcation be along the Dniester River, an arrangement that again would place the facility in Moldovan territory. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a boundary dispute.
