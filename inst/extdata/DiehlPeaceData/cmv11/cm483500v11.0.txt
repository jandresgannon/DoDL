A peace agreement was reached on July 7, 1999 and signed by all six states (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) on July 10, 1999. Two rebel groups signed later in August of 1999. However, the agreement was never fully implemented or adhered to and at some point denounced both by the rebel groups as well as Democratic Republic of Congo. The end date is set to June 3, 2001 as this is 6 months after the last codable incident. As for Chad it withdrew its troops following a peace agreement attempt on April 18, 1999. First day of dispute was on 9/29/1998 and last day of disput was on 4/30/1999.
