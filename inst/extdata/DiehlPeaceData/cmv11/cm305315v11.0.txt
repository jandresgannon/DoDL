TERRMID: MID3181 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID3181 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler (2018), Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente, but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force to prevent Austria from joining Germany or the Little Entente. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because no states were disputing territory here, although Austria was intending to voluntarily unify with another country (other countries) to solve its economic crisis. Coded uncertain because Gibler (2018) drops Czechoslovakia from this dispute, as they seem to have no part in it.
