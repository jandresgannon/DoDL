PS-UPDATE2020: Refugees and rebels fleeing violence in Burundi continue to experience abuse from Tanzanian authorities and this remains a point of contention between the two states. - see * HRW 2020: reports that 18 Burundian refugees and asylum seekers have been gravely abused by Tanzanian authorities since late 2019, and there are several other reports that these Tanzanian authorities were involved in other forced disappearances and instances of torture: (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/30/tanzania-burundian-refugees-disappeared-tortured#) (https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/11/30/tanzania-burundian-refugees-disappeared-tortured#) Human Rights Watch report in December 2019 found that the fear of violence, arbitrary arrest, and deportation was driving many Burundian refugees and asylum seekers in Tanzania out of the country.


PS-NOTES:
The underlying issues that can be attributed as the cause of MIDs are still prevalent; these include refugees or rebels fleeing the violence in Burundi across the border with Tanzanian acquiescence, the instability in Burundi, and the like make this lesser rivalry unresolved.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1362 from Gibler 2018, Hutus in Tanzania raided parts of Burundi. In response, Burundi retaliated by killing many Hutus in Burundi, which created a massive refugee flow into Tanzania. Burundi accused Tanzania of supporting anti-Burundi rebel groups who were seeking refuge in Tanzania. Burundi then entered Tanzania and attacked both rebels and civilians, leading to a protest from Tanzania. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity within this dyad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4118 from cm narrative, many refugees were fleeing from Burundi to Tanzania, and Burundi regularly attacked these refugees to target rebels among them. From Gibler 2018, in 1995, this led to a state of very high border tensions and regular border violations by Burundi, and Tanzania threatened to invade Burundi if it did not cease the border violations. Coded civil war MID because this was conncected to militarized rebel activity within this dyad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4123 from Gibler 2018, in 1997 a Burundian military vessel crossed into Tanzanian waters and was fired upon. Per Gibler, this was connected to refugee and rebel activity in Tanzania (anti-Burundi rebels were crossing the border into Tanzania to seek refuge).

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4311 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, Tanzania increased troop presence near the border with Burundi to control the refugee situation. COW has this MID coded as a troop buildup on the border, but GML argue that this is not a MID because the buildup was not directed at Burundi, Burundi did not protest, and Burundi even commended Tanzania for controlling the refugee situation at this time. Coded civil war MID because although this was directly connected to refugee flow management, per BBC (5/11/2000) the refugees were created by widespread attacks against civilians by terrorist groups, thereby implying a level of organized, militarized group activity. Tanzania and Burundi held talks to attempt to coordinate military action to attack the terrorists. Coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped.

Relations have been hostile for several years due to Burundian refugees in Tanzania and cross border attacks. In September, a Burundian military boat violated Tanzanian waters and was fired upon and a separate border violation by Burundi occurred nearby. On October 27, a clash between Burundian and Tanzanian forces (primarily an artillery exchange) occurred. In November, residents of eastern Burundi observed a buildup of Tanzanian troops near the border. First day of dispute was on 9/27/1997 and last day of dispute was on 11/00/1997.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Burundi military aircraft bombed Kagunga, Kibuti, and Mubarazi in Tanzania on March 15, 1973, resulting in the deaths of 41 Burundi refugees and 36 Tanzanians. The Burundi government apologized to the Tanzanian government for the bombings on April 3, 1973. Burundi troops attacked rebels in Tanzania on June 29, 1973, resulting in the deaths of ten Tanzanians. The Tanzanian government issued a protest to the Burundi government on July 3, 1973. President Micombero of Burundi referred the matter to the president of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) on July 3, 1973. Burundi troops and Tanzanian troops clashed near the border on July 13, 1973. President Idi Amin of Uganda appealed to Tanzania to withdraw its troops from the border region on July 14, 1973. President Joseph Mobutu of Congo (Kinshasa) mediated the signing of a joint communique on July 21, 1973, which provided for Burundi compensation to Tanzania for the killing of ten Tanzanians in June 1973.

NARRATIVE-CR:

In September of 1994, the political parties in Burundi agreed to a power-sharing agreement. In February, 1995 the Union for National Progress (Uprona) demanded that Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko be removed. On February 7, President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya called for him to step down. On February 11, Kanyenkiko called for an immediate general strike, and this led to general insecurity throughout the country. As of February 21, Tanzania complained that 25,000 refugees had fled to their country from Burundi. In June, there was a wave of killings of Hutus by Tutsis in Burundi. On June 28, Tanzania accused the Burundian military of invading its territory to kill Tanzanian Hutu people as well. This began MID4118. The incursions and refugee flow from Burundi continued for most of the rest of 1995 and over the course of the next 3 years.

MID4123 occurred in 1997. On August 25, 1997, talks began between the Hutu and Tutsi communities of Burundi and Tanzania to end the violence between the two groups, despite the government of Burundi's refusal to participate. The Burundian Foreign Minister accused Tanzania of harboring Hutu rebels amongst the 300,000 refugees along its Western border. Tanzania accused Burundi of planning an invasion. Heads of State of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe called upon Burundi to restore control at a meeting in Dar es Salaam from September 3-4. Violence continued through the month though. Clashes occurred along the border of Burundi and Tanzania throughout October and November of 1997. Meanwhile, Tanzania began expelling and reportedly mistreating refugees.

Nelson Mandella mediated talks between rebel groups in Burundi in May of 2000. I was unable to find specific disputes that occurred between Tanzania and Burundi during this time, although MID4311 is listed as occurring here.

The second rivalry between Burundi and Tanzania dealt with the conflicts between the Hutu and Tutsi communities that plagued several countries in the region during the mid to late nineties. The final dispute occurred in May of 2000, and therefore it is far too early to consider this rivalry to be terminated.

On August 18, 2000, President Bill Clinton of the United States was expected in Tanzania to witness belligerents in the Burundi civil war sign a peace pact 28 August. The American embassy in Dar es Salaam said in a statement that Clinton would also meet Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa while in the northern town of Arusha during his one-day visit. The two leaders would be among heads of state and government invited to witness the signing of the Burundi peace pact to end the six-year civil war. This will be Clinton's first visit to Tanzania. He accepted the invitation upon the request of retired South African President Nelson Mandela, facilitator of the Burundi peace process. Clinton will arrive in Arusha after a visit to Nigeria 25-28 August. Mandela's representative, Mark Bomani, will 21 August brief journalists on the progress of the Burundi peace negotiations involving 19 factions over the past 23 months.

Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said on May 9, 2001, that Burundi's endless accusations against Tanzania on its alleged supports to the Burundi's rebels would cease only after the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement on Burundi is fully implemented. The president made the remarks at the State House here during discussions with a French delegation of military trainers for peacekeeping activities in Africa. "They make a lot of noise now and then, but I assure you that we are not, in any way, responsible for the problems in Burundi. These are internal problems, they should not look for an excuse," said Mkapa. He said that the solution to Burundi's woes should be sought within the boundaries of the country rather than pointing an accusing finger at its neighbors. It is only the implementation of the Arusha Peace Accord on Burundi that Tanzania, along with other neighboring countries of the central African state could effectively deal with all those sabotaging the agreement, Mkapa added. He said Burundi had a duty of policing its common border with Tanzania, it should look for ways of tightening control on its borders because Tanzania is not responsible for its internal problems. However, Mkapa said that it is difficult to make tight patrol on the activities taking place in various refugee camps which host thousands of Burundians. The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry has officially denied and termed as "unfounded" allegations by the Burundian government that it had been offering military training to Burundian rebels. In one of his latest accusations, Burundian President Pierre Buyoya said in an interview with the regional weekly East African that Tanzania is aiding the rebels fighting against his government. Burundi's civil war has left more than 250,000 people dead, most of them civilians, since the Hutu rebels took up arms in 1993 against the Tutsi minority government.

On May 24, 2001, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has said the international community should relocate all Burundi refugees living in Tanzania to safe havens inside Burundi which would be guarded by the UN. He said this move would help Tanzania avoid being blamed by the Burundi government which says it is helping armed groups which are fighting it. The president said the Burundi refugees should be taken to any country if it was not possible to have them returned to Burundi. President Mkapa said this after talks with a UN Security Council delegation which visited him at State House, Dar es Salaam. The statement followed among other things a message by the leader of the delegation ambassador Jean David Levitte French ambassador to the UN on claims by the Burundi government that the Tanzanian government was helping armed groups which are fighting the Burundi government. President Mkapa explained that there was sufficient proof showing that the international community wanted to believe Burundi's lies and have it as an agenda. He said Burundi had repeatedly wanted to relate its internal problems to Tanzania instead of implementing the Arusha peace accord. The president reiterate that Tanzania was not in any way involved in Burundi's internal affairs although Burundi persisted with such claims. He said the responsibility of protecting refugees was not only Tanzania's but that of all countries because of UN conventions. He said it was sad that Tanzania was being subjected to unfounded accusations despite its efforts to give sanctuary to over 1,200,000 refugees. Commenting on the Tanzania-Burundi border, President Mkapa said the border was long since it covered 150,000 square kilometres. He said Tanzania was failing to fully secure the border because the exercise was expensive. President Mkapa said the cost of guarding the Tanzania-Burundi border was higher than the ministry of education's budget. He reiterated that he will not use money paid by Tanzanian tax payers to solve the problems of another country since the responsibility of guarding the Burundi side of the border was that of the Burundi government and not Tanzania's. However, President Mkapa said his government will continue to cooperate with all sides involved to ensure that the Arusha peace agreement on Burundi and DRCongo's Lusaka accord were implemented.

On July 16, 2002, Tanzania has expressed outrage at what it calls "false reports" that Burundian rebels are using its territory to attack the transitional government in Bujumbura. Burundi Defense Minister Cyrille Ndayirukiye accused Tanzania of hypocrisy regarding its role in brokering the Burundi peace talks-due to take place this week-and of tolerating Burundi rebels on Tanzanian territory. "This is a serious contradiction," Ndayirukiye told Radio Burundi. "This is the country which was the other day saying that it was assisting Burundi by bringing rebel groups to the ceasefire round table. At the same time, one can see at its border a military organization, interaction between [Burundi] rebels and the [Tanzanian] population on the Tanzanian side."
The Tanzanian minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete, told Radio Tanzania that these accusations had been made before. However, he said his government was "amazed" by claims by a section of the Burundi media; noting that Tanzania had, for a long time, had close contacts with the Burundi government. Kikwete added that it was "laughable" to claim that Tanzania would aid Burundi rebels since it was bearing a huge burden of refugees from that country. He said aiding the conflict in Burundi was as good as creating insecurity in Tanzania. Tanzania, home to some 800,000 Burundi refugees, has repeatedly denied allegations of being used as a Burundi rebel stronghold and recruitment site.

On October 12, 2002, Tanzania wanted Burundi to deploy soldiers along the border to stop Hutu rebels from infiltrating the country, instead of leaving the task to Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF), the minister for defense and national service, Prof Philemon Sarungi, said in an exclusive interview with The Guardian. The minister, who seemed disturbed by frequent claims by the Burundi government that Tanzania has been training and arming the rebels, said TPDF was not created to protect Burundi interests along the common border of the two countries. "We have a more than 400 km-long common border. We are unable to position TPDF troops throughout the border for the sake of stopping Burundi rebels from crossing over. To end the war of words, it is the duty of Burundi armed forces to spread all over the border," observed Sarungi. The minister said looking at the way Tanzania has been handling the Burundian situation, and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Burundi refugees, she deserved appreciation from the Burundi government, instead of accusations of training and supporting rebels. "The way we have been handling the Burundi war situation and the huge influx of Burundi refugees, Tanzania deserves a positive attitude from Bujumbura authorities instead of the way the neighboring nation looks at us," he added.
Prof Sarungi repeated that Hutu rebels were within Burundi, therefore the only option for the Burundi government would be to adhere to the peace process as a means to end blood bath in the tiny central African nation. He reiterated the commitment made by President Benjamin Mkapa to his Great Lakes counterparts during the summit that Tanzania will go on playing her role to ensure peace is restored in Burundi. "Though tolerance has own limits. But as promised by President Mkapa during the Monday summit, we will go on supporting the peace process in Burundi. TPDF will ensure Tanzania borders are safe, and where necessary will extend support to Burundi troops though that means TPDF performs what the Burundi army has to perform," said Prof Sarungi. 
There is mounting anger within the Tutsi community in Bujumbura following threats made on March 7, 2003, by the Tanzanian defense minister, when he accused the Burundi army of violating his country's sovereignty by pursuing CNDD-FDD National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy Hutu rebels right up to Tanzanian soil. The Tanzanian minister's accusations, combined with his threats to deploy the Tanzanian army to the border between our two countries to prevent incursions by the Burundi army, show a further lack of confidence and the double talk of the Tanzanian authorities.
Indeed, while Tanzania is being asked to prevent incursions by Hutu rebels from Tanzania soil onto Burundi soil, the Tanzania authorities are saying: that there are no Burundi rebels in Tanzania; that they do not have sufficient soldiers to assign to the border between our two countries; and that it is up to the Burundi army to defend our own border. While the Burundi army is carrying out its duty by chasing Hutu rebels to a place where they believe is appropriate, the Tanzania minister is making accusations and threatens to invade Burundi. Tanzania has shown further bad faith by refusing the deployment of UN troops along the border between our two countries to control and prevent rebel incursions from Tanzania soil. The truth is that in Tanzania there exists a very powerful anti-Tutsi lobby which revolves around John Malecela MP and Foreign Affairs Minister Jakaya Kikwete, which wants to install, by the use of force, an extremist and genocidal Hutu regime in Burundi. It is this anti-Tutsi lobby which controls Peter Nkurunziza and Hussein Rajabu of CNDD-FDD. The lobby paints in glowing terms an armed takeover in Burundi with immense military support from Tanzania. This is why the Nkurunziza-led wing of CNDD-FDD is heavily recruiting young Hutus to increase its presence throughout all the communes of the country.

On November 15, 2003, Burundian President Domitien Ndayizeye flew to Dar es salaam, Tanzania where he was to attend the regional summit on Burundi. The summit will ratify agreements signed between the government and Pierre Nkurunziza's wing of the CNDD-FDD rebel National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy.

On April 18, 2006, the fate of the peace talks between the Burundi government and the remaining rebel group, the Force for National Liberation (FNL) scheduled to take place in Dar es Salaam hangs in the balance. Burundi, which has boycotted the talks, now accuses Tanzania of supporting a "terrorist group." Since mid-March, the FNL leader Agathon Rwasa and his delegation have been in Dar es Salaam waiting for "unconditional peace negotiations with the Burundi government." The Burundi government, through its spokesman Karenga Ramadhani, has confirmed that it has received an invitation from Tanzania requesting it to attend the peace negotiations with FNL in Dar es Salaam. The major reason for not attending the talks, a source from the Burundi government said in Dar es Salaam last week, was the fact that the "invitation had no agenda." As a result no delegation will be sent to Tanzania for the talks. 

The major problem of the Burundian refugees in Tanzania was not solved as of December 31, 2006, and the accusations between the two countries went back and forth after 2000. Given the tensions I argue that the there is no evidence to indicate the rivalry has ended since 2000.

Tanzania became independent on December 9, 1961. Burundi became independent on July 1, 1962. The relations between the two countries from 1962 to 1973 are undocumented. There does not seem to be any significant relations between them.

The first rivalry between Burundi and Tanzania was very short-lived. It consisted of two disputes that occurred over the span of a few months in 1973. Burundi military aircraft bombed Kagunga, Kibuti, and Mubarazi in Tanzania on March 15, 1973, resulting in the deaths of 41 Burundi refugees and 36 Tanzanians. The Burundi government apologized to the Tanzanian government for the bombings on April 3, 1973. Burundi troops attacked rebels in Tanzania on June 29, 1973, resulting in the deaths of ten Tanzanians, ending MID1362. 

MID2617 quickly followed though when the Tanzanian government issued a protest to the Burundi government on July 3, 1973. Burundi troops and Tanzanian troops clashed near the border on July 13, 1973. President Joseph Mobutu of Congo (Kinshasa) mediated the signing of a joint communique on July 21, 1973, which provided for Burundi compensation to Tanzania for the killing of ten Tanzanians in June 1973. This ended the first of the two rivalries that are listed for Tanzania and Burundi.

A signing ceremony of an agreement for establishing a joint organization for management and development of the Kagera river basin was held on August 25, 1977, at Rusumo falls on Tanzania-Rwanda-Burundi border. Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi president jean Baptiste Bagaza signed the agreement at the ceremony attended by several thousand people. The three presidents laid the corner stone for the organization's headquarters in Kigali, capital of Rwanda on August 25, 1977 evening. The Kagera River runs through Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. The governments of Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi have been carrying out studies since 1971 for comprehensive planning on integrated development of the Kagera River Basin.

On May 13, 1978, President Julius Nyerere wound up his four-day official visit to Burundi. A joint communique was issued in Bujumbura at the end of the visit. It said that the Tanzanian President and his Burundi counterpart were willing to ensure that the cooperation between the two countries was strengthened. The two countries had decided to set up a permanent joint commission to analyze all aspects of cooperation between them, it added. The communique noted that the two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. Speaking at a banquet given on May 8, 1978 in his honor, president Nyerere pledged Tanzania's continued commitment to assisting its land-locked neighbors to ease their transportation problems. He stressed that Tanzania and Burundi would cooperate in various inter-African functional organizations and struggle for the freedom of Southern Africa. The people of Tanzania and Burundi regarded each other as brothers, he said. Burundi president Jean Baptiste Bagaza said at the banquet that the economic and cultural relations between the two countries had been consolidated.

On May 15, 1978, Tanzania and Rwanda have agreed to increase cooperation in the commercial, cultural and political fields, and to take immediate steps to improve road communication between them, according to a Tanzania news agency Shihata report. This was announced in a joint communique issued in Kigali at the end of the Tanzanian president's three-day official visit to Rwanda. The communique said that presidents Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Habyarimana Juvenal of Rwanda expressed satisfaction at the agreement between Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi on the establishment of the organization for the management and development of the Kagera River Basin. They called for the immediate construction of the proposed dam at Rusumo and the implementation of agricultural and training programs of the organization. The two presidents also discussed the liberation struggles in Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa, the communique said.

On February 14, 1980, the presidents of Tanzania and Burundi expressed concern over the current world situation which threatens international peace and security, said a joint-communique issued in Dar Es Salaam. President of Burundi Jean Baptiste Bagaza paid a state visit to Tanzania from February 12 to 15, 1980. The communique said two presidents held discussions on bilateral, African and international issues of mutual interest to their two countries. Regarding the situation in Southern Africa, the two leaders paid particular attention to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe caused by Britain's non-adherence to the letter and spirit of the Lancaster house agreement. in particular they condemned the deployment of Rhodesian army and auxiliaries and the presence of south African forces inside Zimbabwe. They called on Britain to ensure scrupulous adherence of the Lancaster house agreement if the forthcoming elections in Zimbabwe are to be free and fair. With regard to Namibia, the two leaders reaffirmed their support for right of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence and condemned South Africa's designs on Walvis bay, an integral part of Namibia. The two presidents noted with grave concern that the apartheid system and laws of repression are in total disregard of OAU and UN resolutions. They called upon the UN to impose economic sanctions including an oil embargo against the apartheid regime. The two leaders also signed a general agreement on cooperation between two countries.

On July 30, 1981, Tanzania's diplomatic missions in Rwanda and Burundi have been promoted to the status of full ambassadorial level with immediate effect. A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the decision takes into account the good relationship existing in various fields between Tanzania and the two neighboring countries. The statement added that this action would enable the three countries to consolidate and increase the existing good relations between Tanzania and the Republics of Rwanda and Burundi.

On February 8, 1983, Burundi has hailed Tanzania's effort to fight against theft of Burundi-bound goods at the Dar es Salaam port and the efficient operation of the Tanzania Railways Corporation in the ferrying of goods. According to a report adopted by the fourth meeting of the Tanzania-Burundi joint technical committee on transport the Burundi delegation expressed hope that the measures will continue to be applied and that additional measures will be taken. The committee recommended that Tanzania should speed up identification of a suitable site adjacent to Dar es Salaam port to be used for building a Burundi warehouse. Tanzania promised Burundi that measures will be taken to improve the security of Ubungo depot and make the old copper yard available for storage of Burundi goods.

Talks aimed at strengthening relations between Tanzania and Burundi began in Dar es Salaam on June 9, 1983, between high-ranking officials of the Interior Ministries of the two countries. The Burundi delegation at the talks is led by the countries' Interior Minister, Lt-Gen Charles Kazatsa, while the Tanzanian delegation is led by the Minister for Home Affairs, Ndugu Abdallah Natepe. 

On June 14, 1983, Tanzania and Burundi stressed in a joint communique in Dar Es Salaam, the need to establish close cooperation between their police and prison departments. The cooperation will start as soon as possible with the exchange of vital information, the communique said. It was reported that smuggling and poaching have been rampant in areas along the Tanzanian-Burundi border, which have caused much headache to police of the two countries. During a visit to Tanzania by a Burundi delegation led by minister for home affairs Natepe, the two countries pledged their commitment to safeguarding independence, freedom and justice of the two peoples. The communique said that the two countries are also committed to the duty of the African continent as a whole.

A new five-year trade agreement between tanzania and burundi was signed on December 20, 1986, to increase border trade and combat smuggling. The agreement followed a meeting of the Tanzania-Burundi joint commission in Arusha, northern Tanzania, according to the Tanzanian news agency (shihata). Under the agreement, Tanzania will sell to Burundi salt, cement, textiles, corrugated sheets, radios, batteries and other items while Burundi is expected to export blankets, hides and skins, detergents, paints and varnish and pharmaceutical products to Tanzania. Tanzanian minister of state in the president's office responsible for international cooperation Kighoma Malima said that the payment arrangements, which were being worked out by the central banks of the two countries, would operate through the preferential trade area (PTA) for east and southern Africa. Both Tanzania and Burundi are members of the 15-nation regional organization. Tanzania and landlocked Burundi enjoy close political and economic relations. the latter relies on Tanzania's Indian Ocean port of Dar Es Salaam for some of its imports and exports. The two are also tied in the Kagera basin organization, which also embraces Rwanda and Uganda.

The Burundi president Pierre Buyoya paid a one-day working visit to Tanzania on November 5, 1988, with a pledge from his host that Tanzania will fully support his country's efforts to bring about national unity and stability. A communique, issued here after his official talks with Tanzanian president Ali Hassan Mwinyi, said the two sides appreciated progress so far reached in different areas under their commission of cooperation. It said the Tanzanian president reiterated his country's full support of Burundi's efforts to enhance national unity and stability. Mr. Mwinyi told a press conference after talks with president Buyoya that his country would do its utmost to support the Burundi government in its initiatives for peace. About 5,000 people were killed and many more others fled the country in last august tribal clashes between the country's two tribes, Hutus and Tutsi. Since then the Burundi government formed a body to bring national unity in the tiny central African state. President Buyoya told reporters that his government was ready to receive refugees who wanted to return home. He said the clashes had been initiated by Burundi's enemies who wanted to bring about disunity and injustice in his country, saying his government had been taking serious measures to prevent further clashes and killings. This is president Buyoya's second visit to Tanzania since he took power in Burundi last year. He visited Tanzania early this year. Burundi and Tanzania, together with Uganda and Rwanda, are members of the Kagera basin organization, set up in 1978 with the aim of exploring large areas for agriculture, energy and communication.

On May 21, 1990, Tanzanian business people were looking forward to improved business with the tiny Central African state of Burundi following the arrival in Dar Es Salaaom of Prime Minister Adrien Sibomana. Sibomana flew into the Tanzanian capital to begin a three-day visit, his first since he was appointed prime minister in October, 1988. Trade between the two neighboring states has improved during the last four years, but bureaucracy and other delays on the Tanzanian side have been major obstacles to further development, Burundi embassy officials said. "We expected Tanzanian goods would be priced competitively, but prices have been higher than those of other countries," one embassy official told IPS. In 1988 Burundi imported almost 60,000 tons of goods from Tanzania, while Tanzania imported about 30,000 tons of goods from its neighbor. "There is a good deal of trade imbalance between our countries. We will discuss this during Sibomana's visit," the embassy official said. Officials of the state-run Tanzania Board of External Trade (BET), however, have described Tanzania's trade with landlocked Burundi over the past four years as "impressive." Tanzania's exports to Burundi grew from around one million dollars worth of merchandise in 1987 to about $2.5 million worth in 1988, according to BET estimates. "But there is more room for expanding trade," emphasized BET officials. Between 1970 and 1982, Burundi imported about 80 percent of its total imports from Tanzania, but owing to delivery delays and high prices, Burundi has now switched to Kenya, Djibouti and Zambia for its imports. Smuggling and illegal migration will also be discussed between officials of the two countries during the visit, according to officials of the Tanzanian foreign ministry. Shipment of goods from the port city of Dar es Salaam to Burundi will also be one of the major issues to be discussed during the visit. Tanzania currently ships 600,000 tons of goods through this port annually. Other southern and central African countries using the port of Dar es Salaam for their foreign trade are Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The port has an annual capacity of handling 4 million tons of goods. Delays, pilferage and shortages of freight cars and locomotives are some of the negative facts holding up the smooth flow of exports and imports.

The Tanzanian minister for regional administration and local government Joseph Warioba said on May 21, 1991, in Dar Es Salaam that his country would help Burundi refugees return to their home country from Tanzania. Mr. Warioba made the promise during his talks with Burundi minister for home affairs and development of local communities Libere Yana-Kunnyetse. Warioba said Tanzania will help the Burundi refugees to return to their home country smoothly and in an orderly manner according to international norms and conventions regarding to refugees. He said that Tanzania would not allow some Burundi refugees to use its soil as a spring board to attack their home country. The Burundi minister is in Tanzania to co-ordinate the repatriation of the thousands of Burundi refugees. He delivered a special message from Burundi president Pierre Buyuya to Tanzanian president Ali Hassan Mwinyi and held talks with representatives of Burundi refugees in Tanzania.

Tanzania was ready to strengthen brotherly relations with Burundi, foreign minister Ahmed Hassan Diria said in Dar Es Salaam on September 29, 1991. During his talks with the new Burundi consul Farinkandi Fabien, Diria said that Tanzania attached importance to cooperation with Burundi in social and economic development. Earler this month, president Ali Hassan Mwinyi visited Burundi, during which he exchanged ideas with his Burundian counterpart Pierre Buyoya on ways of expanding trade between the two countries, especially in railway and road transportation between Tanzanian capital Dar Es Salaam and Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi. Tanzania and Burundi, in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have signed an agreement on voluntary repatriation of Burundi refugees in Tanzania.

On January 9, 1992, Premier John Malecela of Tanzania and his Burundi counterpart Adrian Sibamona discussed the ways to strengthen economic co-operation between the two countries, in the western Tanzanian border town of Kigama. The two leaders, in their brief meeting in the morning, discussed ways of improving road transport and the launching of joint economic projects. They also touched on the possibilities of providing Kigoma region with electricity from Burundi and of having a joint sugar factory at the border. The two leaders emphasized that border trade between Tanzania and Burundi should be regulated to curb illegal trade and smuggling. The problem of Burundi refugees in Tanzania was also discussed. Malecela reiterated Tanzania's position that the country would not allow its soil to be used for subversive activities against neighboring states. He also said Tanzania was impressed by the spirit of national reconciliation adopted by the Burundi government.

On December 7, 1993, Tanzania urged the government and the army in burundi to stop immediately ongoing tribal massacres which have led to a huge influx of refugees into Tanzania. Tanzanian Prime Minister and first vice-president John Malecela said on December 7, 1993 in Dar Es Salaam, that the government of Burundi had the responsibility to restore peace in their country and protect lives of its people. In his strong remarks over the issue, the prime minister said that since the abortive military coup in that country eight weeks ago, about 500,000 Burundians had fled into Tanzania, exerting immense pressure on the available social and economic resources. Malecela said that there were recent reports that some Burundi soldiers were crossing into Tanzania, harassing innocent Burundi refugees and robbing them of their cattle and property. He reiterated that the Tanzanian government was deeply concerned with the disturbing development and was keen to see that peace is restored there as soon as possible. But to the contrary, Malecela said, the Burundi army is reportedly involved in killing the people in Burundi and fueling tribal backlashes. as a result, he said, more refugees were expected to cross to Tanzania. He said, "the Burundi government should understand that Tanzania reserves the right to take any necessary measures to stop the flow of refugees into the country."

In a strongly worded statement on June 12, 1995, Tanzania warned it could not sit back and watch the Burundi army massacre civilians. "We can't stay as spectators. We will act strongly if the army continues to kill the people," said foreign affairs permanent secretary, Ibrahim Msabaha. "Tanzania urges the Burundi government to ensure such murders are stopped immediately," Msabaha said in an official statement. "The killings of innocent people in Burundi could not be seen as the internal affairs of Burundi. This is genocide and against human rights." The reaction follows the Burundi army's operation last week in the capital Bujumbura to clear Hutu gunmen from the suburbs of Kamenge and Kinama. A number of civilians, mostly the aged and children who did not flee, were killed by the army and their Tutsi militia allies. Insecurity has continued in the central African country with reprisal killings of Tutsis. Clashes also broke out over the weekend between Hutu and Tutsi students at the university campus in the east of the city which left eight people dead. According to Msabaha, standing in for the foreign minister Joseph Rwegasira touring Russia and China, some of those who have died in the violence in Burundi have been Tanzanian nationals. "As a neighbor, we will not stay and see such murders continue. We can't just stand and see people being killed," Msabaha said in the government authorized statement. "We have been closely following the recent killings in Burundi and the killings have been done by the soldiers." He also accused the army of violating the sealed Tanzanian border to hunt down fleeing Hutu refugees and looting. "The crossing of the Burundi soldiers into Tanzania is not only a violation of international laws, but it is also an act of violence which needs to be rectified," the statement said. The government has warned that its soldiers on the border have orders to shoot at Burundi troops seen crossing into Tanzania. Tanzania, hosting more than 700,000 refugees from Burundi and Rwanda, closed its border with Burundi two months ago following a wave of killings by the Tutsi-dominated army which drove thousands of Hutu refugees into the country. Burundi's Hutu president Sylvester Ntibatunganya visited Tanzania last month asking for military help from Dar es Salaam. The request was backed by defense minister Firmin Siazoyiheba. Organization of African Unity general secretary Salim Ahmed Salim has added his diplomatic weight for firmer action. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni travelled to Tanzania last week to discuss the situation in Burundi, while Rwanda's Vice President and Minister of Defense Paul Kagame paid a call on Bujumbura. Museveni called for a joint effort among countries in the sub-region to end Burundi's political crisis. Ethnic instability has gripped the country since President Melchior Ndadaye was killed, along with a number of politicians, by dissident Tutsi paratroopers in an attempted coup in October 1993. Ndadaye was the country's first elected leader. He was also the first Hutu to rule Burundi since independence in 1962, despite the fact that Hutus make up 84 percent of the population. Burundi, whose ethnic mix mirrors neighboring Rwanda, took a diametrically opposite political path since independence. Fear of the social revolution which swept Hutus to power in Rwanda resulted in a determination by Tutsis in Burundi to ensure their rule. A genocidal purge in 1972 known as the "ikiza" or scourge claimed 100,000 lives and eliminated the Hutu elite. Tutsis were left with control of the armed forces and civil service. The attempted coup which killed Ndadaye was provoked by suspicions that he was intending to reform the army and open it to Hutu recruitment. His death led to a whirlwind of ethnic slaughter in which 50,000-80,000 people died in the first few weeks. Burundi's weak power sharing government which includes both Hutus and Tutsis is caught in a vice of extremism. Hutu militia accuse the president of being a traitor and bending to far to appease the army. Tutsi hardliners say the army is the only national institution and point to Rwanda's carnage last year as what could happen unless the militias are crushed. The result of the instability, in which the army is accused of ethnic cleansing, is the creation of a refugee crisis. Thousands of Hutus, mostly from Rwanda, are camped on the Tanzanian border. It remains to be seen however if the United Nations will fund the deployment of African soldiers to Burundi and whether, beyond threats, a force could be mustered. The Burundi army has made it clear in the past they would not accept external military intervention. The first MID of RIV1126, MID4118 started on June 15, 1995.
