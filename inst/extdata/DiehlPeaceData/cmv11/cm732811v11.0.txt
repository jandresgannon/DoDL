CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1217 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this is a series of attacks by US and South Vietnamese forces on Cambodian territory. Communist guerillas fighting against South Vietnam were using Cambodian territory for bases, and the US and South Vietnam attacked the bases while Cambodia protested.
