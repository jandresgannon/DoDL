On June 15, 1969, the Communist China Deputy Premier Li Hsien-nien attended the Nepalese Embassy reception to mark 50th birthday of King Mahendra. He stated that China and Nepal are 'friendly neighbors' and said that China has always shown respect for Nepal's policies of peace, neutrality and independence.

On April 17, 1970, the newly opened 70-miles road in Nepal, between Kodari-Katmandu, constructed by Communist Chinese was inaugurated. This is seen as providing Westerners with view of Tibet, which has been traditionally closed to outsiders. The road, which can easily accommodate military equipment, extends to Lhasa, Tibetan capital and a major Chinese military headquarters.

The Chinese Vice-Premier Teng Hsiao-Ping's visit to Nepal on February 9, 1978, was regarded as having opened up new prospects for the development of friendship between Nepal and China by Nepalese papers in recent editorials or articles. "Gorkhapatra" says editorially that vice-premier Teng's visit "has made the close historical relations existing between Nepal and China still closer and deeper. That is why relations between the two nations have developed constantly."

The third session of the Nepal-China boundary joint inspection committee was held in Katmandu from 10th January to 27th February, 1979. A press release on 27th February said that matters relating to drawing a new Nepal-China topographic boundary map on the scale of 1:50,000 and drafting the final document on the first joint inspection of the Nepal-China boundary had been discussed during the session. The two sides, through full mutual consultation in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, had reached complete agreement on these matters. The two sides also reviewed and expressed full satisfaction at the work done by the Nepal-China boundary joint inspection teams which undertook the joint inspection of the Nepal-China border from 31st July to mid October 1978. The Notes on the third session of the joint inspection committee were signed on 27th February 1979 by Cao Shenggong, chief representative of the Chinese side, and Bishwa Pradhan, chief representative of the Nepalese side of the joint inspection committee.

The fourth session of the China-Nepal Joint Boundary Inspection Committee concluded in Beijing on September 3, 1979. The two sides, through mutual consultations in a cordial and friendly atmosphere, reached agreement on all matters. The notes on the meetings for the present session were signed on the same day by Cao Shenggong, chief representative of the Chinese side of the Joint Inspection Committee, and Bishwa Pradhan, chief representative of the Nepalese side. The session started on August 27, 1979, the two sides examined and confirmed the protocol between the government of the People's Republic of China and his majesty's government of Nepal on the first joint inspection of the China-Nepal boundary drafted by the protocol group of the joint inspection committee and the maps attached to the protocol based on the first joint inspection of the China-Nepal boundary submitted by the map group of the joint inspection committee. The said protocol and the attached maps were initialed by the chief representatives of the two sides and will be submitted to the plenipotentiaries of the two governments for signature. Up to now, the first joint inspection of the China-Nepal boundary has been a complete success. The two sides have expressed their great satisfaction at the work of the present joint inspection. Present at the signing ceremony were the Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs He Ying and the Nepalese ambassador to China Y.N. Khanal. After the signing ceremony, the two sides proposed toasts to the successful completion of the first joint inspection of the China-Nepal boundary. The Nepalese delegation left Beijing to visit Shanghai, Hangzhou and Guangzhou before returning home.

On July 22, 1980, judging by recent reports from Nepal, the pro-China cliques there have obviously stepped up their activities. They demand that the Government reconsider the foreign policy aimed at safeguarding peace and security in Asia, make false charges against progressive activists and threaten them with physical harm. The Maoist elements in Nepal are trying hard to complicate Nepal's relations with neighboring countries, and to undermine Kathmandu's relations with Moscow and Delhi. China's leading clique has been trying for a long time to use its fifth column in Nepal to influence that country's public opinion and push the policies of its Government onto a path to Peking's advantage. Early in the 1970s, Peking's leaders began to intimidate Nepal with rumors about the threat from Indian and Soviet aggression. At the same time, it openly announced that if necessary China would come to Nepal's aid. In 1971, the Nepali Foreign Ministry issued a formal statement, saying that Nepal needed no foreign aid, because it had most friendly relations with India, the USSR and other countries.

On August 5, 1980, on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Nepal and China, Tanka Prasad Acharya, former Nepalese Prime Minister, told the Nepalese national news agency that China's relations with Nepal over the past 25 years were "an ideal example of good neighborliness". Foreign Minister K.B. Shahi has said Nepal and China maintained very close and satisfactory relations of friendship. Speaking at a function held in Kathmandu to mark the completion of 25 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries by the Nepal-China Friendship Association today [3rd August], the Foreign Minister said Nepal considers that China has given a feeling of good-neighborliness all through the period of our relations.

On September 16, 1984, the Nepalese Foreign Minister Padma Bhahadur Khatri praised the Nepalese-Chinese relations as a model of friendship between a major power and a small neighbor.

The Nepalese Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha said in Kathmandu on September 25, 1986, that based on the principles of peaceful co-existence, Nepal and China have maintained good relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1955. The prime minister made the remarks at a public meeting sponsored by the Nepal-China friendship association marking the 37th national day of the People's Republic of China at the city hall. He noted that Nepal always stresses the view of peace for development and pays high tribute to China's support for the proposal that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. The prime minister also praised china's economic assistance for Nepalese development. With strengthening economic and trade cooperation and establishing an air-link between Kathmandu and Lhasa in the near future, the two countries' relations will be promoted and grown closer day by day. On the occasion, Poorna Bahadur M.A., chairman of Nepal-China friendship association, said that China is the most reliable friend of Nepal. China's aid contributes to Nepal's efforts for achieving economic self-reliance, he added. Tu Guowei, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal, expressed his deep confidence that the China-Nepal friendship conforms to the basic interest of the two countries and contributes to preserve the regional peace.

On April 21, 1988, Nepal and China agreed to take measures to address the trade imbalance between the two countries, which was heavily in favor of China at that time.

Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng arrived in Nepal on November 19, 1989, at the start of a three-day visit amidst an unresolved dispute between the Himalayan kingdom and its southern neighbor, India. Nepali officials privately say they hope China, which is one of India's chief rivals in the region, will come out openly in support of Nepal in the dispute. So far, Beijing has only made mildly sympathetic comments about the Indo-Nepal quarrel, and has refrained from blaming New Delhi for the eight-month-old dispute. Relations between the two South Asian neighbors nose-dived when a bilateral trade and transit treaty expired in March and negotiations to renew it deadlocked. India closed most of its border transit points to landlocked Nepal, and Nepal-bound goods from third countries through the port of Calcutta were disrupted. Nepal's already-fragile economy took a direct hit and has been floundering ever since. A meeting between Nepal's King Birendra and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in September 1989 failed to end the deadlock. Indian newspapers this week said it is doubtful that China would use Li's visit to support Nepal materially or morally unless it serves China's purposes in the region. The "Times of India" newspaper said the Chinese "are not interested in fishing in troubled Himalayan waters." But a Western diplomat in Kathmandu told IPS the prolonged stalemate may leave Nepal no choice but to lean more heavily on Beijing. Nepali officials have remained defiant amidst a collapsing economy and have said they are prepared to make any sacrifice to safeguard the country's sovereignty. "We believe that (Li's) goodwill visit will further strengthen the ties of friendship, understanding and cooperation between Nepal and China," said chief government spokesman Radhe Shyam Bista. Bista said he hoped Li's visit would reinforce bilateral ties and help "improve the regional atmosphere of peace and cooperation."

A meeting was organized on August 3, 1990, for the 35th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Nepalese diplomatic relations. The Nepalese prime minister K.P. Bhattarai attended the meeting together with eight ministers from his 11-member council of ministers. He appreciated the cordial friendship existing between the two countries and said that Nepal anticipates the development of Sino-Indian relations. Nepal would benefit more if India and China become close to each other, he noted. He expressed the hope that the day will come when Nepal, India and China would make joint investments. The Chinese ambassador to Nepal Li Debiao noted, "to further develop Sino-Nepalese relations based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence not only accords with the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries, but also contributes to the peace, stability and development of the region." He said China will make its own efforts to strengthen cooperation in every field between the two countries. Poorna Bahadur M.A., chairman of the Nepal-China friendship association, said that as a small country between China and India, Nepal wants friendship with both the neighbors. His association will continue to work for the consolidation of Nepal-China friendship, he pledged.

On September 23, 1990, the Nepalese Prime Minister K.P. Bhattarai said that the current Nepalese interim government will further develop its friendly relations with China. He was addressing a gathering organized by the Nepal-China friendship association and the Nepal-China Cultural Council to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The Nepali Deputy Prime Minister Ram Chandra Poudel said in Kathmandu on May 24, 2000, that Nepal will always maintain good relations with China and will not allow anyone to conduct anti-China activities in Nepal. "Nepal and China are close neighbors who enjoy cordial friendship and do not have any outstanding problems between us," said Poudel while meeting with a Chinese government delegation. "As we are both developing countries, we also share mutual interests and concerns on the international forum," he said. The Chinese delegation led by State Councilor Ismail Aymat was visiting Nepal for a five-day goodwill visit to Nepal. Poudel also expressed his confidence that the friendship between China and Nepal will be further promoted by the development of cultural and trade relations. Speaking on the occasion, Ismail expressed his appreciation for Nepal's support to China on issues of Tibet and Taiwan and its commitment not to allow anti-China activities in Nepal. "We, on our part, will always support Nepal's effort for independence and national sovereignty," said Ismail. "China always believes that all countries, big or small, are equal. The cordial relations between China and Nepal are a good example of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," he said. "We are willing to develop cooperation in all fields," he added. Ismail said that as China and Nepal share a lot of common interests, the two countries have great potentials for cooperation in trade, culture and joint ventures. Such cooperation is for the benefits of the people of both countries, he said.

Nepali Foreign Minister Chakra Bastola said on July 30, 2000, in Kathmandu that Nepal and China will further augment socio-economic cooperation based on the cordial political relations. Speaking at a gathering to mark the 45th anniversary of the establishment of Nepal-China diplomatic relations, Bastola said Nepal and China have time and again proved to be genuinely close and trustworthy neighbors. "Our relations of friendship, understanding and mutual cooperation date back to many centuries, and in the recent history of our political relations, exchanges of high-level visits, have been significant in further consolidating our age-old good relations," said Bastola. Bastola urged business and industrial community in China to take advantage of the investment-friendly climate in Nepal and further facilitate economic cooperation between the two countries. Also speaking at the gathering, Madan Regmi, Chairman of China Study Center in Nepal, reiterated Nepal's firm determination to continue the exemplary model of relationship between Nepal and China based on the principles of sovereign equality, peaceful co-existence and mutual respect. "It is high time Nepal-China relations grew faster in all spheres. Considering the closeness of our relations, we still have a long way to go together," said Regmi. More than 100 people, including Nepali officials, foreign diplomats stationed in Nepal and Nepali persons from all walks of life attended the gathering, jointly organized by China Study Center and Institute of Foreign Affairs affiliated with Nepali foreign ministry.

On July 11, 2002, the Chinese President Jiang Zemin has expressed support to visiting Nepalese King Gyanendra for the government's campaign against Maoist rebels. The Nepalese king, on his first visit as head of state to China, also discussed bilateral relations with Jiang. Jiang thanked the King for Nepal's support for China on Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. Both sides witnessed the signing of an economic and technical cooperation agreement with China and a trade cooperation accord between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Chinese President Hu Jintao said in Beijing on August 16, 2004, that China treasures its traditional friendship with Nepal and will continue to deepen bilateral cooperation in all areas. Hu made the remark during his meeting with Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Nepal Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev in the Great Hall of the People Monday afternoon. Hu said China and Nepal are good neighbors. The peoples of the two countries share a history of friendship lasting more than 1,000 years. Hu said since the two countries established diplomatic ties 49 years ago, relations have been growing steadily. Hu said the two sides respect and treat each other as equals. They also trust and support each other. Hu said he appreciates the King of Nepal and the royal family for their special and important role in developing the relationship. He also thanked Nepal for lending precious support to China on such issues as Tibet and Taiwan. Hu said China is willing to push the good-neighborly partnership between the two countries to a new level. Paras said Nepal highly appreciates the support and assistance that China has given to Nepal over the years. He said Nepal is satisfied with the results of cooperation with China. He stressed that Nepal will continue to stick to the one-China policy. Paras said Nepal is ready to further increase exchanges of visit by high-ranking officials of the two countries and expand exchanges and cooperation in such areas as trade, economy, education and culture. Noting that he is deeply impressed with the rapid development of China, Paras said Nepal is ready to continue to push forward good-neighborly, friendly and cooperative relations with China. Paras arrived in Beijing Saturday afternoon, continuing his 13-day official visit to China. Paras visited Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tibet before his Beijing tour, where he will conclude his visit Tuesday. During his stay in Beijing, Paras attended a ceremony marking the setup of the China-Nepal Friendship Association. China and Nepal signed four agreements on economic and technological cooperation and other areas in Beijing on the same date. The documents include the Agreement on Economic and Technological Cooperation between the governments of the two countries, an agreement on Nepal's use of a road in Tibet to transport goods, an agreement on a bridge across the borders of the two countries and an agreement on automobile transportation. Chinese Vice Premier Huang Ju and visiting Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Nepal Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev attended the signing ceremony. During their meeting before the signing of the agreements, Huang said China places great importance on expanding mutually beneficial cooperation with Nepal and is willing to expand communication and cooperation between the enterprise and business circles of the two countries. He said China is ready to enhance friendly communication with Nepal and continue to explore new forms and ways of cooperation in all fields.

Nepal-China Society, a friendship organization of Nepal, celebrated in Kathmandu, on August 9, 2005, the golden jubilee of China-Nepal diplomatic relations. "The relations between Nepal and China in the last 50 years were the worthy model of state-to-state good-neighborly friendship and cooperation," Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Sun Heping said at the function. Nowadays, mutual understanding, respect and trust and treating each other equally have become salient characters of China-Nepal relations, and there is no outstanding problem but friendship and cooperation between Nepal and China, Sun said. "We will continue to be Nepal's good neighbor, friend and partner," Sun added. The people of Nepal have always attached great importance to its relations with China and have high regards for the Chinese leaders, Ram Babu Tiwari, president of Nepal-China Society, said at the function. Nepal-China Society was established in order to promote friendship and understanding between Nepal and China at people's level, Tiwari noted, adding, "We will work to achieve our goals to strengthen our bonds of friendship." High officials of the Nepali government, diplomats, former prime ministers of Nepal, representatives of Nepal-China friendship associations and journalists were present at the function.
