TERRMID-NOTES: MID4258 from cm narrative, this is the Ethiopian-Eritrean War. In May 1998, border skirmishes between Ethiopia and Eritrea spun into the world's largest conventional war at the time. The war displaced hundreds of thousands of residents and claimed several thousand causalities. From the outset, U.S. diplomats worked through the Organization of African Unity to bring a peaceful end to the war. In June 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire. On December 12, 2000, they signed a permanent peace treaty. The treaty established a process for the demarcation of the border between the countries, working through old colonial documents to establish the boundary. The Commission completed its delimitation in April 2002, but the demarcation process subsequently stalled due to continued disagreement. As of 2018, it had yet to be completed. Coded territorial MID because this was a territorial war.

The war displaced hundreds of thousands of residents and claimed several thousands causalities. From the outset, U.S. diplomats worked through the Organization of African Unity to bring a peaceful end to the war. In June 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire, December 12, 2000 they signed a permanent peace treaty. The treaty established a process for the demarcation of the border between the countries, working through old colonial documents to establish the boundary. More than 4,000 U.N. peacekeepers have been assigned to help keep the peace. The treaty calls for the return of troops on both sides to positions prior to the conflict. This is particularly critical in light of Spring 2000 offensive, during which Ethiopian troops ranged far into Eritrea's territory. The treaty also sets up a process for settling claims and compensation for damaged property on both sides. First day of dispute was on 5/6/1998 and last day of dispute was on 12/00/2000.
