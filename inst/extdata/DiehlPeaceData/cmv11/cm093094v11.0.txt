PS-UPDATE2020: The last MID between the two occurs in 2010. In that same year, Costa Rica files a case with the ICJ. Disagreements over borders and related matters continue throughout the decade, but now the disputes are generally channeled to legal instituions, as evidenced by three subsequent ICJ cases. Thus, even though disagreements persist they are handled by peaceful conflict management mechanisms rather than violence, and thus the relationship shifts from lesser rivalry to negative peace.

Nicaragua repeatedly encroached on Costa Rican territory and supported insurgent forces to fight in Costa Rica. Nicaragua's motivation in doing so was to bring a friendlier regime to power in Costa Rica, as Nicaragua had done throughout Central America. Coded civil war MID because Nicaragua supported rebel groups in Costa Rica to fight against the regime.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2546 from cm narrative, Costa Rica and Nicaragua had negotiated to reach an agreement to stop disputes coming from each other — particular from accusing the other of harboring rebels. These negotiations failed and further disputes occurred afterward, with each again accusing the other of harboring rebels. There were indeed rebels located in each country that opposed the respective governments. The states agreed to refer the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on June 7 1985. Coded civil war MID because accusations of harboring rebels led to this MID.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2735 from cm narrative, this MID was connected to the ongoing civil war in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan troops clashed with Costa Rican troops when they pursued Contra rebels into Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica may have supported the rebels and at the very least allowed their territory to be used as a safe haven from Nicaraguan troops.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2573 from MID-B data, this MID occurred 4/16/1986. This MID seems to be connected to the discovery that the American CIA was providing support to Contra rebels, some of which were in Costa Rica. The NYT reported on 4/14/1986 that the CIA provided cash to several parts of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest of which was in Costa Rica. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved the ongoing civil war in Nicaragua and rebels located in Costa Rica. Coded somewhat certain because it is not clear that the discovery of the CIA support for Contras actually triggered this MID, but it is certain that Contra rebels were located in Costa Rica. This issue had triggered previous MIDs between Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

Repatriation efforts led to a border incursion by Costa Rica's civil guard. Coded not territory because the border was not disputed and this was an attempt to deport/repatriate illegal immigrants.

TERRMID-CER: MID4147 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4147 from cm narrative, this MID occurred 7/16/1998. This was another MID triggered by Costa Rica forcefully repatriating illegal Nicaraguan immigrants. Costa Rica's search for illegal immigrants led to Costa Rican police patrols along the San Juan River that delimits the border between the countries. Nicaragua claimed that the patrols violated agreements between the two countries and subsequently ordered the Nicaraguan army to prevent Costa Rican police patrols on the river. Coded somewhat territory because the dispute combined a) an issue of deporting/repatriating illegal immigrants with b) appropriate behavior in the border zone. The inland river boundary was settled in 1858 and delimited by the early 1900s; nonetheless, the agreements contained specific rights for Costa Rica in the border area—particularly the river— and Costa Rica often protests Nicaraguan action in the border region when it feels that this behavior violates the rights granted by the border agreement.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID4508 The dispute’s central feature is an island in the San Juan River, but the river itself comprises the border between the two countries. The inland river boundary was settled in 1858 and delimited by the early 1900s; nonetheless, the agreements contained specific rights for Costa Rica in the border area—particularly the river— and Costa Rica often protests Nicaraguan action in the border region when it feels that this behavior violates the rights granted by the border agreement. Coded somewhat territory because behavior in the border region (and a dispute over the rights afforded to each in the border region) contributes to the MID.

ISLMID-NOTES: MID4508 from cm narrative, this MID occurred in October 2010. Costa Rica protested cross-border intrusions by Nicaraguan forces. Tensions between each state had been high over dredging operations undertaken by Nicaragua in the San Juan River, which Costa Rica claimed had negative environmental impact on its territorial holdings on the Calero Island. The inland river boundary was settled in 1858 and delimited by the early 1900s; nonetheless, the agreements contained specific rights for Costa Rica in the border area—particularly the river— and Costa Rica often protests Nicaraguan action in the border region when it feels that this behavior violates the rights granted by the border agreement. After Costa Rica’s complaint in 2010, Nicaragua then claimed sovereignty over a small portion of an island in the San Juan River, with its troops replacing a Costa Rican flag there with a Nicaraguan flag. The dispute was brought to both the Organization of American States and the International Court of Justice. The latter ruled that each state is to refrain from sending any military or civilians personnel to the disputed area (save for Costa Rican environmental monitors), and to refrain from taking any action that may extend the existing dispute. Coded islands MID because a claim over sovereignty of islands began here and triggered this MID. Note that these are inland river islands.

 On 10/21/2010 and again on 11/2/2010, Costa Rica protested cross-border intrusions by Nicaraguan forces.

Nicaragua-Costa Rica relations have been problematic in many issues. In January 1995, Costa Rica expelled thousands of illegal Nicaraguans residing in Costa Rica. Nicaraguan press claimed that Costa Rican farmers exploited and mistreated Nicaraguans. They also have different views on the navigation on San Juan border river. During the most recent of these disputes, according to Nicaraguan government, on March 3, 1995, 13 members of the Costa Rican civil guards crossed the border to Nicaragua while pursuing illegal immigrants. They were seized by Nicaraguan forces. In a retaliatory act, on March 5, 1995, two Nicaraguan policemen were arrested by Costa Rican authorities after they crossed the border "to get a drink of water." By March 6, 1995, the two sides had exchanged their prisoners. First day of dispute was on 3/3/1995 and last day of dispute was on 3/00/1995.

On July 16, 1998, an incident occurred over navigation rights on the San Juan River separating Nicaragua and Costa Rica. A Nicaraguan patrol boat stopped a Costa Rican patrol boat, claiming that Costa Rican guards were not allowed to carry weapons on the river, which belongs to Nicaragua. Following two weeks of protests, the two countries reached a new agreement on July 30, 1998. This new agreement allowed Costa Rican guards to carry weapons on the river, but also required them to report to various Nicaraguan military stations along the river. In August, following renewed Nicaraguan prohibition of Costa Rican moves with weapons on the San Juan River, Costa Rican President ordered a "heavy" military deployment on the border. Nicaragua reacted by suspending free navigation on August 3, 1998 and voided the agreement that had been signed in July. After nearly two years of uncertainty, a navigation rights agreement was reached on July 3, 2000. First day of dispute was on 7/16/1998 and last day of dispute was on 8/00/1998.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Costa Rica and Nicaragua disputed their border beginning in 1842. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed the *Treaty of Canas-Jerez* in San Jose on April 15, 1858, which provided for the delimitation of their border. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed another border agreement on January 19, 1884, but the agreement was later rejected by Costa Rica. Guatemala mediated the signing of an arbitration agreement by Costa Rica and Nicaragua in Guatemala City on December 24, 1886, which provided for arbitration by the president of the United States if bilateral negotiations failed to resolve the border dispute. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed a border agreement in Managua on July 26, 1887, but the agreement was not ratified. The countries asked President Grover Cleveland of the US to arbitrate the border dispute on July 30, 1887, and President Cleveland immediately agreed to the request. President Cleveland issued a decision on March 22, 1888, which upheld the validity of the 1858 *Treaty of Canas-Jerez*. El Salvador mediated an agreement between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in San Salvador on March 27, 1896, which provided for the establishment of a demarcation commission consisting of three engineers from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and the US. Nicaraguan troops invaded Costa Rica near Los Chiles on July 20, 1897. Guatemala mediated an agreement between Costa Rican and Nicaraguan representatives on April 26, 1898. Costa Rica protested an agreement signed by Nicaragua with the US on February 8, 1913 concerning the American desire to build a canal across that country. The US and Nicaragua withdrew the agreement, but signed the *Bryan-Chamorro Treaty *in Washington DC on August 5, 1914. Costa Rica also objected to this treaty since Nicaragua had failed to comply with Article 8 of the 1858 *Treaty of Canas-Jerez* (which required Nicaragua to consult with Costa Rica concerning the building of a canal from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean). Costa Rica submitted the dispute to the *Central American Court of Justice* (CACJ) on March 24, 1916, and requested that the CACJ declare the *Bryan-Chamorro Treaty* null and void. The CACJ decided on September 30, 1916 that it could not declare the treaty null and void, but that Costa Rica's rights had been violated by Nicaragua. Nicaragua rejected the CACJ decision. Costa Rica moved some 500 troops to the border with Nicaragua on May 25, 1918 to prevent a rebel invasion from Nicaraguan territory. Costa Rican rebels led by Julio Acosta Garcia invaded Costa Rica from Nicaraguan territory on May 6, 1919, and established a provisional government in Pena Blanca.

Nicaraguan troops intervened in support of the government of President Teodoro Picado Milchalski on April 17-21, 1948, but President Picado Milchalski was deposed by Nicaraguan rebels led by Colonel Jose Figueres Ferrer on April 19, 1948. Some 250 Costa Rican rebels loyal to former President Rafael Calderon Guardia invaded Costa Rica from Nicaragua on December 10-11, 1948. Costa Rica mobilized military personnel to the border, and referred the matter to the *Organization of American States* (OAS) Permanent Council on December 11, 1948. Costa Rica claimed that Nicaraguan soldiers were involved in the invasion that resulted in the death of six individuals. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and United States) chaired by Juan Batiste de Lavalle of Peru on December 15, 1948.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The rivalry between Costa Rica and Nicaragua centered on continuous attacks by Nicaragua on Costa Rica through explicit support of exiled invasion forces or through encroachments on Costa Rican territory. These actions began as early as April 1948, with Nicaragua supporting exiled Costa Rican forces in an invasion attempt, MID2340. The first series of disputes, MID2340 MID2339 MID1193 MID2042, ended in 1957 following a sustained intervention by the OAS that resulted in the *Pact of Amity* between the two countries in 1949 and a 20-personnel military observation mission (Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, and the US) led by Lt. Colonel Ricardo Ramos Flores of Mexico to monitor the border region beginning on January 17, 1955. Nicaragua agreed to end military assistance to the rebels in Costa Rica, and the rebel troops withdrew from Costa Rican territory on January 20, 1955. The OAS commission of inquiry issued a report on February 18, 1955, which suggested that the Costa Rican rebels were mostly based in Nicaragua. The OAS Permanent Council disbanded the commission of inquiry on February 24, 1955, and established a nine-member conciliation commission to mediate a resolution to the dispute. The OAS conciliation commission mediated a cessation of the crisis between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in Washington DC on January 9, 1956. 

Hostilities between the two countries resumed in 1977 when Nicaraguan military aircraft violated Costa Rican airspace and attacked three Costa Rican boats on the Frio River on October 14, 1977. This attack was an attempt to fight Nicaraguan rebels, MID3013 and was followed by an invasion of Nicaragua by 300 Nicaraguan rebels from Costa Rican territory on September 10, 1978. In response, Nicaraguan military aircraft attacked Nicaraguan rebels and Costa Rican civilians in La Cruz, Costa Rica on September 12, 1978, MID2346. Without an active, standing military, Costa Rica was often forced to refer matters to third parties such as the OAS. Rebels on both sides had used the border territories as launching off points for attacks on their respective countries with each state blaming the other for harboring rebels. Both states held bilateral negotiations in Paris in September 1984, MID2349, to find a solution to the problem. Further fighting did occur after this however, leading the two states to refer the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on June 7, 1985, MID2546. More negotiations continued, facilitated by the Contadora Group (Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama) from February 24 to March 12, 1986. 

At the end of the rivalry, the disputes were largely due to an ongoing civil war in Nicaragua that caused troops to often cross over into Costa Rica thereby clashing with Costa Rica's Rural Guard. Costa Rica's innocence was questionable in these disputes as its border region served as bases from which Nicaraguan Contras launched attacks against the Sandinista government. When the US took an increased role in eliminating the Sandinista regime, it pressured Costa Rica to use its territory from which to support the guerilla movement. With a declining economy and need for US economic aid, Costa Rica at the very least ignored the actions of the Contras on Costa Rican territory along with their US supporters, thus continuing the rivalry for a while after the last mid between Nicaragua and Costa Rica in September 1987, MID2735. 

In an effort to end the rivalry, Oscar Arias, elected president on May 8, 1986 made efforts to assert Costa Rican neutrality by arresting Contra rebels, closing a US funded Contra airstrip and criticizing US efforts to aid the Contras. In addition, The Arias plan was launched in February 1987 and endorsed by all of Central American's presidents in August of that year to begin a series of talks with opposition groups to end guerilla actions throughout the region. This plan provided legitimacy to the Sandinista government and thus helped to ease tensions between the two countries. In August 1987, Costa Rica and Nicaragua took part in the signing of a peace accord in Guatemala, along with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador). The peace accord committed each state to stop aiding US backed guerillas against the Nicaraguan government by November 1987. In October, a senior Costa Rican official was quoted as stating that they "...were trying to build Costa Rica's credibility as a neutral country, to establish some authority to become a regional mediator. We wanted to show we are not just a blind instrument of the Yankees." In 1987, president Sanchez won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in bringing about the peace accords in Guatemala. In March 1988, the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to a cease-fire with Arias helping to broker the agreement. In February 1989, under the auspices of the Arias plan, the Central American presidents all agreed to actions that would lead to the disbanding of the Contras and Nicaraguan elections in 1990. Thus, the main factor in the continuation of the rivalry, the Contras operating from Costa Rican soil, was no longer an issue. In February 1990, Violeta Chamorro was elected president of Nicaragua, ending the Sandinista regime and bringing a semblance of democracy to the country. By this time the rivalry between the two countries had certainly come to an end. 

Two further disputes have occurred between the two countries, MID4146 on 3/3/95 and MID4147 on 7/16/98. Both involved Costa Rica's repatriation of Nicaraguan illegal immigrants and should not constitute part of the terminated rivalry that occurred due to the Nicaraguan civil war . In 1995, repatriation efforts led to a border incursion by Costa Rica's civil guard along with their arrest. In 1998, the search for illegal immigrants led to Costa Rican police patrols along the San Juan River that delimits the border between the countries. Nicaragua claimed that the patrols violated agreements between the two countries and subsequently ordered the Nicaraguan army to prevent Costa Rican police patrols on the river. The two countries reached an agreement on July 31, 1998 that allowed for illegal immigration patrols by the Costa Rican police with Nicaraguan escorts.

After the election of Julio Acosta as president of Costa Rica on December 9, 1919, this country remained stabile until 1948. In Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza, who served in the late 1920s and early 1930s as Nicaragua's Consul to Costa Rica, became the ruler of the country. In April 1940, Nicaragua and Costa Rica signed the Cordero Reyes-Zuniga Montufar Treaty, which aimed to economically develop the area around San Juan River, which forms the border between the two countries. However, this treaty was not implemented by the Nicaraguan part. This period is spent by both countries dealing with internal development issues and less with foreign policy issues. The tensions over the San Juan River seemed to be lowered, with more conflicting issues over the rebel groups within Costa Rica and Nicaragua who were attacking the other country's leadership. These groups were most of the time acting without the approval of the host government. Nicaraguan troops intervened in support of the government of President Teodoro Picado Milchalski on April 17-21, 1948, but President Picado Milchalski was deposed by Nicaraguan rebels led by Colonel Jose Figueres Ferrer on April 19, 1948.The first MID of RIV233, MID2340 started on 19480419.

19570828-19771013 0.5

The last MID of RIV233, MID2042 ended on 19570623. During this period, the Government of Costa Rica adopted an official policy of neutrality towards the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua. At the presidential level the relations were quite good, however the Costa Rican Congress always pushed the President to take tougher stances towards Nicaragua. A large number of Nicaraguan exiles lived in Costa Rica and they organized anti-Somoza movements from there. On August 28, 1957 an armed band invaded Costa Rica from Nicaragua and took possession of an estate belonging to the Minister of Agriculture. Same day Nicaragua sent army reinforcements to the border to had off a band that seized arms in Costa Rica and headed toward Nicaragua. In February 1959 a joint customs office was opened. Some 110 Nicaraguan rebels invaded Nicaragua from Punta Llorona, Costa Rica on May 31, 1959. Nicaragua referred the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on June 2, 1959. The OAS Permanent Council established a four-member commission of inquiry (Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, and the US) on June 4, 1959 to investigate the dispute. The OAS commission of inquiry, which was chaired by Julio Lacarte of Uruguay, issued a report on July 16, 1959 that indicated that the exile invasion was organized in Costa Rica, but without the knowledge of the Costa Rican government. Some 90 individuals were killed during the invasion attempt. The Government of Costa Rica made it clear that it had nothing to do with the Nicaraguan rebels and that it was not willing to change its policy of neutrality toward the Nicaraguan revolt. On August 4, 1959 another group of Nicaraguan rebels invaded from Costa Rica. In November 1959 Nicaragua proposed to Costa Rica to set up a mixed commission to study disputes arising over the border between the two countries. Managua also made a clear threat that asked Costa Rica to stop invasions by Nicaraguan rebels from its territory. In December 1959 and January 1960 more invasions by Nicaraguan rebels from Costa Rica. The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry made it clear to Costa Rica that it is not disposed to permit new attacks of this kind. On October 6, 1964, the Nicaraguan National Congress abrogated the Chamorro-Bryan Treaty of 1914. From 1974 to 1976 the old issue of contention over the San Juan River resurfaced due to Costa Rican governmental papers that presented the disputed areas as part of Costa Rica. Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in an agreement signed by their presidents in Managua, in 1977, decided to push ahead a program of economic integration with the aim of fully utilizing their resources. The program includes joint administration of 200-mile patrimonial sea, joint efforts to prevent and cure black rust disease of coffee, and linkage of the electric networks of the two countries. Some 90 individuals were killed during the invasion attempt. Nicaraguan military aircraft violated Costa Rican airspace and attacked three Costa Rican boats on the Frio River on October 14, 1977 (MID3013).

The last MID of RIV234, MID4147, ended according to the MID dataset sometime in August 1998 (no exact date provided). Considering that a major agreement was reached on July 31 1998, one could consider the end of the MID on August 1, 1998. The two countries reached an agreement on July 31, 1998 that allowed for illegal immigration patrols by the Costa Rican police with Nicaraguan escorts. Disputes with Nicaragua, in the form of angry diplomatic exchanges, have flared up periodically over illegal immigration and access to the San Juan River, which divides the two countries. But the possibility of a military engagement between the two sides is remote. In the late 1970s and the 1980s Costa Rica took in large numbers of refugees fleeing from civil war in neighboring Central American countries, particularly Nicaragua. Pacification of the region reduced the flow, although many Nicaraguans have stayed on, and more continue to emigrate to Costa Rica in search for jobs and a better life. Legal temporary workers from Nicaragua are estimated at 70,000, while up to 6,000 illegal immigrants are returned each month. In 1992 the official count of refugees was 114,000, but realistic estimates including undocumented refugees put the figure at over 200,000 and some observers estimate it to be as high as 400,000. The latest census, carried out in 2000, recorded 190,963 Nicaraguans officially resident in the country. At around 4.8% of the overall population, this represents by far the largest group of immigrants. However, the true number of Nicaraguan immigrants living in Costa Rica is likely to be much higher, given that only a minority have legal status. Border police turn back up to 150 would-be Nicaraguan migrants per day. In July 1999, Nicaragua objected to the deportation of 35 Nicaraguans who were detained along with 1,500 other people on June 30, when police chased squatters off land south of San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. Nicaraguan President Arnold Aleman responded by suspending a summit of Central American leaders scheduled to be held in Managua. His government claims Costa Rican authorities beat some of the people and denied them due process before they were deported. Costa Rica denies the allegation. Costa Rica, meanwhile, is losing patience with the flow of Nicaraguans into its territory. By the end of the 90s, between 500,000 and 700,000 Nicaraguans are believed to be in Costa Rica, a number that accounts for 15 percent of Costa Rica's population. Most are illegal immigrants who work for low pay on coffee and sugar farms, on construction sites, and as domestic servants. An amnesty expired at the end of July for illegal Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica, imposed after Hurricane Mitch devastated Nicaragua last October. Regarding the river dispute between the two countries, tempers seemed to be cooling a bit, with the countries signaling they may seek a peaceful solution to both disputes. But there is still no date for talks between the two governments, and more trouble looms on the horizon. In March 2000 the negotiations between the two countries over the right to use the San Juan River were reopened with the presence of a OAS facilitator. Aleman, the Nicaraguan President, fearing a wave of deportations, has asked for an extension. But under pressure from a strong opposition, Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez rejected it. In October 2001, President Arnoldo Aleman said that Costa Rican guards could travel on a disputed river-with Nicaraguan permission. His comments came a day after he snubbed Costa Rica's vow to carry the border dispute to the World Court, saying Nicaragua will not recognize any ruling. He also threatened to impose a 35% tax on Costa Rican goods if Costa Rica brings the case to the ICJ. Within the framework of a special Central American Summit meeting held on 26 September 2002, Costa Rica and Nicaragua agreed to abstain, for three years, from trying to resolve their differences by judicial means and instead to resort to dialogue. The trade between Costa Rica and Nicaragua increased 155% from 1993 to 2003. In July 2003, Costa Rica and Nicaragua announced the adoption of a series of joint border controls. During the same summit a Trust Management Contract was signed between the two countries. The contract, which was signed by both governments and the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE), will provide the necessary resources to manage a Special Development Fund, which `will underwrite the various cooperation initiatives arising from the Strategy for the Development of Nicaragua-Costa Rica Border Areas. "The Nicaraguan objection for getting the International Court of Justice to intervene in the territorial dispute between the two countries expired on 26 September 2005. According to a joint document of the Foreign Ministries, this strengthening can be achieved by "the two countries promoting the view that any dispute can be resolved by means of fraternal and direct dialogue and not through a judicial body". According to the agreement signed by Caldera and Tovar, "within this framework of thought, Nicaragua's reservation presented to the International Court of Justice will remain unaltered, that is to say frozen, for a period of three years." The Costa Rica-Nicaragua dispute regarding the San Juan River is based mainly on the fact that even though Costa Rica has the right to free use of the river, its policemen cannot bear arms as they travel on the river. This, plus the fact that Nicaragua set a 9-US-dollar fee for traveling on the river, generated friction between the two countries and led them to seek an international judicial solution. In October 2005 Costa Rica has filed a case against Nicaragua at the International Court of Justice over control of the San Juan River that runs between the countries. Nicaragua recalled its ambassador to Costa Rica a week before that and had already sent troops to the region. Costa Rica argued in its filing that Nicaragua has illegally limited its access to the river since 1998. It stated that Nicaragua "imposed a number of restrictions on the navigation of Costa Rican boats and their passengers on the San Juan River" violating a treaty signed between the countries in 1858. On September 28th, 2005, the army of Nicaragua was ordered to increase its patrols along the San Juan River and to halt by any means the entry of armed troops, the transport of weapons, munitions and supplies by foreign troops. Recently, in 2007, the Arias administration announced the start of talks with the Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, on various issues, including navigation along the San Juan River and immigration.
