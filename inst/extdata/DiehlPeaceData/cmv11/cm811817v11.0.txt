On December 4, 1970 Pope Paul VI appealed to North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and Cambodia to stop fighting and seek a just peace. Cambodia claimed that North and South Vietnam were cooperating in efforts to resettle ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodian territory on December 9, 1970. Pope Paul VI called for a negotiated settlement to the crisis in Indochina on March 29, 1971. On July 15, 1971 Cambodia demanded that South Vietnam withdraw all of its troops from Cambodia following reports of widespread looting by South Vietnamese troops in various Cambodian villages.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Cambodia and South Vietnam revolve around two issues, territorial disputes/lack of respect for Cambodian sovereignty and the Cambodian support for/complaisance towards North Vietnamese troops using Cambodian territory for attacks on S. Vietnamese/US troops.

MID1214 occurred in February of 1956. The Diem government in S. Vietnam attempted to suppress domestic elements, including the Hoa-Hoa religious sect, resistant to central government control. Some leaders of this sect were killed while others fled to Cambodia. From November of 1955 to March of 1956 small units of the S. Vietnamese Army occasionally attacked Cambodian territory in pursuit of Hoa-Hoa and other dissidents.

MID1215 occurred from May until July of 1958. The two countries had an old border disagreement that had not been resolved at the 1954 Geneva settlement of the first Indochina War. Contested islands in the Mekong River Delta provoked minor incidents during the mid 1950s. In late June of 1958 S. Vietnamese military forces occupied the village of Strung Treng withn northern Cambodia. Cambodia protested the incident to the International Control Commission. Vietnam withdrew from Strung Treng by July 1, 1958.

MID2732 occurred on June 20 1959. This MID is about territorial integrity and violation of sovereignty. Four clashes between Cambodian Army Units and South Vietnamese armed bands entering Cambodian territory in late June of 1959. The Cambodian Army killed 14 South Vietnamese and captured 13.

MID2731 occurred on March 19, 1960. South Vietnam claimed several islands that were also claimed by Cambodia and that were adjacent to Cambodian territory. Cambodian Prince Sihanouk warned S. Vietnam that Cambodia `would not give up one inch of her territory.' The Prince warned that Cambodia knew how to defend itself and had friends willing to lend support in defense of Cambodia.

MID2730 occurred on November 20, 1962. Cambodia accused South Vietnam of violating Cambodian territory and firing on peasants and destroying a rice field in Svayrieng Province. Cambodia argued that South Vietnamese troops penetrated about 2 miles with fighter aircraft cover.

MID2729 occurred from April 22 until October 22, 1963. Here the Cambodian Prince Sihanouk charged the South Vietnamese Navy of shelling a coastal village and stealing cattle. The Cambodians also charged the S. Vienamese of frequent border violations in pursuit of dissidents. Cambodia broke diplomatic relations with S. Vietnam also citing the discrimination of Buddhists in S. Vietnam.

MID1213 occurred from March 13 until April 28, 1964. Here S. Vietnamese and US troops pursued Communist insurgents into Cambodia. They raided a village and in the dispute lost one plan and 17 were killed.

MID1216 occurs from December of 1965 until August of 1965. This MID is a multilateral MID involving China and Cambodia on one side with Thailand, South Vietnam and the US on the other. Here the hostility centers on Cambodia. After cultivating close relations with the US in 1963, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk cancelled all military and economic aid from the US and broke of diplomatic relations with the US in 1965. He felt the Vietnamese Communists in South Vietnam were eventually going to win the struggle for power and entered into a compromise agreement with them. He allowed the NLF and North Vietnam to set up bases along the Cambodian border with South Vietnam and permitted the receipt of shipments at its main port from China and the USSR. Prince Sihanouk got in return the pledge that the Vietnamese would respect Cambodian independence. Additionally he received a pledge that the Vietnamese would not support the Khmer Rouge insurgency that was opposing the Prince. The US along with its allies Thailand and South Vietnam made several incursions into Cambodia in pursuit of Communist forces. In this MID Cambodia made threats to make reprisal attacks and implicitly called on China for assistance in threats to the US.

MID1217 occurred in February of 1967. The Cambodian government charged February 5 that 100 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops had crossed the border into Cambodia February 2 and had attacked the village of Svayngong. The statement claimed that 2 Cambodians were killed and 6 wounded. Here as in previous MIDs the US and S. Vietnamese pursued Communist insurgents and guerillas into Cambodia.

MID1806 occurs from January of 1968 until April of 1968. This is another multilateral MID with the USA and South Vietnam on one side and the PRC and Cambodia on the other. This MID is similar to MID1216. The US and South Vietnam pursue communist forces into Cambodia. Cambodian border guards clashed with the US and South Vietnam. China threatened to intervene on behalf of Cambodia.

The MIDs between Cambodia and S. Vietnam cease when the neutralist Prince Norodom Sihanouk was overthrown and pro US/S. Vietnam Prime Minister General Lon Nol took power in a coup. Lon Nol was a staunch anticommunist and a strong supporter of the US. Lon Nol was encouraged in his coup by the Americans and the S. Vietnamese as they were frustrated with Sihanouk's lack of effort to suppress the Communist use of Cambodian territory in raids on S. Vietnam. When the government of S. Vietnam falls in 1975 the rivalry between the two governments ends as S. Vietnam ceases to exist. The rivalry between a unified Vietnam and Cambodia continues however. The two fight border war from 1975 until 1979.

I could not find any specific information about the relations between Cambodia and S. Vietnam. Knowing that Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state wanted to maintain Cambodia's neutrality during the 1950s in the Indo-China conflicts, and that his left-leaning opinions started to develop into a closer relationship with N. Vietnam only in the early 1960s, it safe to assume that the relationship was a 0.5 for the 54-56 period.

The MIDs between Cambodia and S. Vietnam cease when the neutralist Prince Norodom Sihanouk was overthrown and pro US/S. Vietnam Prime Minister General Lon Nol took power in a coup on March 18, 1970. Lon Nol was a staunch anticommunist and a strong supporter of the US. Lon Nol was encouraged in his coup by the Americans and the S. Vietnamese as they were frustrated with Sihanouk's lack of effort to suppress the Communist use of Cambodian territory in raids on S. Vietnam. From April 29-July 22, 1970, US troops entered the new pro-US Cambodia and wiped out North Vietnam's troops active in eastern Cambodia. The relations between Cambodia and S. Vietnam improved significantly as a consequence. On May 28, 1970, the foreign ministers of S. Vietnam and Cambodia signed a pact that allowed Saigon's troops to enter Cambodia to fight N. Vietnam's troops stationed there. On February 28, 1972, S. Vietnam's troops entered a third time into Cambodia, with Cambodian authorities' approval, to deal with N. Vietnamese troops. On May 1, 1974, another similar event occurred. S. Vietnam ceased to exist on April 30, 1975.
