TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4101 from Gibler (2018), Croatian forces entered Serb Krajina, a self-proclaimed Serbian republic, and this worried Hungary. Hungary deployed troops to the border, increasing tensions. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute, Croatia's attempted annexation of Serb Krajina (outside this dyad).
