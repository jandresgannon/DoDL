MID1353

TERRMID: MID1353 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1353 is the extended Laotian Civil War. The communist and anti-communist factions in Laos each received direct military assistance from other countries. The communist faction in Laos, the Pathet Lao, fought alongside North Vietnamese troops against South Vietnamese troops, who were receiving assistance from the US and its allies helping South Vietnam in the Vietnam War and the associated conflicts during that time, most notably the Cambodian Civil War and Laotian Civil War. New Zealand committed combat troops (and other forms of assistance) to help the South Vietnamese war effort in Vietnam and engaged North Vietnamese troops in Laos as well (Doyle, Grey, and Pierce 2002; Capon 2009). Coded not territory because New Zealand was not claiming territory, but was linked to a territorial dispute of MID1353 which involved N Vietnam and Laos disputing their boundary.

TERRLINK: MID1353 1 -- third party linked to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1353 coded third party because New Zealand was a war participant on the side of US/S Vietnam, against N Vietnam and communist insurgents in Laos. N Vietnam and Laos disputed their boundary as part of their dispute, and New Zealand was a third party in this territorial MID.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1353 is the Laotian Civil War. Coded not civil war because the civil war aspect of this multilateral MID is not within this dyad. 

CIVWARLINK: MID1353 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1353 is the Laotian Civil War. New Zealand committed troops to the Vietnam War, and they eventually fought alongside S Vietnam and the US inside Laos, against N Vietnam and communist insurgents who were fighting to take control of Laos.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID611 is the Vietnam War. New Zealand committed direct combat troops and, later, training troops, to the South Vietnam/US war effort (Doyle, Grey, and Pierce 2002; Capon 2009). Coded not territorial dispute because New Zealand was a belligerent, but was not claiming any territory in Vietnam. New Zealand was a third party link to the territorial dispute of MID611.

TERRLINK: MID611 1 -- third party linked to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID611 coded third party link to territory because MID611 is a multilateral MID which involves a territorial dispute between N and S Vietnam. New Zealand participated in MID611 on the side of S Vietnam and the US against N Vietnam, but was not making a claim on territory.
