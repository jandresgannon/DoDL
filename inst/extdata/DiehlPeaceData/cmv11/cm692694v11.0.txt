PS-UPDATE2020:Although Bahrain was among four states (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and UAE) to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilizing the region with its support for Islamic groups, including the Muslim brotherhood, there was little threat of militarization by Bahrein and the main dispute was between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. There is not enough here to warrant a move to lesser rivalry.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Qatar and Bahrain disputed the sovereignty of the Hawar islands following Bahrain's independence from Britain on August 15, 1971. Bahrain had initially claimed the Hawar islands in 1938, but Qatar immediately rejected Bahrain's claim to islands, which were located 1.5 miles off the western coast of Qatar. The countries had sumitted the dispute for arbitration by the British government, which awarded the islands to Bahrain on July 11, 1939. Saudi Arabia attempted to mediate negotiations concerning the territorial dispute from September 1971 to 1978, when the parties agreed to a set of principles proposed by Saudi Arabia. Qatar's foreign minister had announced that the islands were an integral part of Qatar in March 1976, and Bahrain had conducted military exercises on the islands in March 1978. The *Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Ministerial Council requested that Saudi Arabia resume its mediation of the dispute on March 9, 1982. Bahraini troops and Qatari troops clashed near the coral reef of Fasht al-Dibal on April 26, 1986. Saudi Arabia attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries on April 28-May 1, 1986. The GCC secretary-general mediated negotiations between the countries beginning on May 3, 1986, and the countries agreed to withdraw troops from the coral reef of Fasht al-Dibal on May 25, 1986. Qatar agreed to release the 29 workers that it had arrested on the reef on April 26, 1986. The GCC deployed a military observation mission to monitor the withdrawal of troops. Qatari troops withdrew from the coral reef on June 15, 1986. Bahrain and Qatar agreed to GCC mediation on January 27, 1989, but GCC mediation failed to result in a resolution of the dispute. Bahraini troops and Qatari troops clashed near the disputed islands in June 1991. The GCC mediated an cessation of the crisis, and a GCC military observation team was send to the area. Qatar submitted the dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on July 8, 1991, but Bahrain rejected the referral on July 13, 1991. The ICJ began hearings on the dispute on March 1, 1994. On February 15, 1995, the ICJ ruled that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the territorial dispute. Bahrain continued to object to ICJ adjudication of the dispute, and called for bilateral negotiations or GCC mediation. Bahrain reportedly agreed to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ on January 22, 1996, but Bahraini foreign ministry denied the report on January 24, 1996.
