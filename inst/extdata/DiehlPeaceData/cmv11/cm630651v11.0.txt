PS-UPDATE2020: The two states have not resumed relations as of the end of 2020. The poor relations stem in large part between Egypt siding with the Saudis and the Gulf states against Iran, reflecting Sunni-Shiite splits and support of opposite sides in the Yemeni civil war.

Relations between both countries turned hostile during Nasser's tenure as president, but got better after his death. Therefore, the third period start date should be the day Muhammad Anwar el-Sadat came into power. Relations became cordial and improved until the end of the Iranian Revolution, which turned relations hostile once again.
