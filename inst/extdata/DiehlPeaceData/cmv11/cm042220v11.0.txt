MARITMID-NOTES: MID68 from cm002220v11.0 narrative, the Dominican Republic defaulted on payments to France, and France responded by deploying warships to Santo Domingo. The US, in its own interests of the Monroe Doctrine and its business dealings in Dominican Republic, deployed its own vessels in the area, deterring France from taking any further action. Coded not maritime because no maritime claims were present.
