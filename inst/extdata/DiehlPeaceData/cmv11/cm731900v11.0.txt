MID51 

TERRMID: MID51 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID51 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID51 from cm002710 and Gibler 2018 narrative, this MID is the Korean War. The US and UN forces fought along with the South Koreans, and China fought along with the North Koreans. North and South Korea were engaged in a territorial dispute in the Korean War, and China's and NATO's opposing support led them to fight directly, triggering this MID between them. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the territorial dispute in Korea led these countries to be involved in this multilateral MID. 

MARITMID: MID51 3 -- not maritime 
MARITMID-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID51 the Korean War involved the disputation of maritime boundaries between North and South Korea as well, since each side claimed the entirety of each other's territory. Coded not maritime because North Korea and Australia did not dispute a maritime boundary here, although they are linked to the maritime element of the dispute. 

ISLMID: MID51 3 -- not islands 
ISLMID-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID51 the Korean War involved the disputation of islands off the coast of the Korean Peninsula as well, since each side claimed the entirety of each other's territory. Coded not islands because Australia and North Korea were not disputing islands, but they were linked to the islands element of the Korean dispute here. 

CIVWARMID: MID51 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID51 coded civil war MID because the Korean War had a civil war element, and North Korea is within this dyad. 

CIVWARLINK: MID51 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID51 coded civil war link because the Korean War has a civil war element. Korea was divided along communist vs nationalist lines, and these two groups eventually fought the Korean War. That war is considered a civil war, since the primary disputants were Koreans, and the peninsula was not divided into two states until after WWII, when it also becomes a territorial dispute. North and South Korea claim the entirety of each other's territory and see the opposing regime essentially as a militarized group illegitimately controlling part of the peninsula. Coded civil war link because South Korea is outside of this dyad and involved in a civil war in this MID.

The US deployed weapons to South Korea, and North Korea protested. A clash across the disputed border occurred a week later, and more clashes followed. Several naval attacks also occurred. Australia was pulled into this MID when their Foreign Minister announced Australia's support for South Korea, including sanctions and shows of force against North Korea (Christian Science Monitor 6/22/1994). Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the North-South Korea dispute. 

MARITMID: MID4022 3 -- not maritime
MARITMID-CER: MID4022 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID4022 coded not maritime because, although this was connected to the North-South Korea dispute, in which each country claimed the entirety of the Korean Peninsula (including all of the other's maritime waters), Australia and North Korea did not dispute the waters off the Korean Peninsula.
