CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from Gibler 2018, Zaire was experiencing civil war, and the rebels were being supported by Angola and Cuba. Several countries offered Zaire assistance to defend against the rebels, pulling them into this MID against Cuba and Angola. Coded civil war link because this was connected to a civil war in Zaire, outside this dyad, and coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Congo Brazzaville to be a party to this dispute.
