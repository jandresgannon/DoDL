CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to fight with the rebels against the government, and Zaire suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba for doing so in April 1977. Angola wanted the rebels to succeed and warned other countries not to interfere in the civil war or Angola would respond militarily. Angola had been providing refuge to the rebels themselves. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to the civil war in DRC.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3011 from Gibler 2018, Angola expelled a Zairean attack on an Angolan village in 1978. The DRC was dealing with an ongoing insurgency, and Angola provided refuge to the rebels in its territory, leading to numerous MIDs between the countries. Zaire had invaded the border village likely in response to rebels in the area, and Angola expelled them soon after the invasion. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Angola, who were targeting Zaire.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4071 from Gibler 2018, in 1994 Angola mistakenly bombed a Zairean base but apologized afterward and explained that it was an accident caused by inclement weather interfering with navigation. However, Zaire fortified its borders. Coded civil war MID because although Angola did not intend to bomb Zaire, the action and the resulting border closing by Zaire was connected to militarized rebel activity in Angola. Per BBC 10/28/1994, Angola was attempting to bomb UNITA, a rebel group fighting against the Angolan government in Angola.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4377 from Gibler 2018, after reports from villagers in DRC that Angola was violating airspace over the village, DRC amassed troops on the border. Coded not civil war because, although it is unclear why Angola was violating DRC airspace, the civil war in Angola had ceased by this time. The former rebels in Angola were now a legal party, so they were no longer militarized rebels.

Angolan troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo border as part of an ongoing civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Angola supports rebel troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo and may have sent forces to the border to help cut supply lines to the capitol (Kinshasa).

NARRATIVE-CM:
Angola became independent on November 11, 1975. Some 2,000 Katangan rebels and Luga tribesmen invaded Shaba province in Zaire from Angolan territory on March 8, 1977. President Joseph Mobutu (Mobutu Sese Seko) of Zaire accused Angola of supporting the invasion, but Angola denied the accusation on March 11, 1977. Foreign Minister Joseph Garba attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries beginning on March 23, 1977. President Mobutu appealed to the president of the OAU for military assistance on April 2, 1977. France airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops to Zaire on April 10, 1977. Moroccan troops were withdrawn from Zaire on May 25, 1977, and the Katangan rebels were defeated by Zairean troops on May 26, 1977. Some 1,000 individuals were killed during the conflict, including 219 Zairean soldiers and 7 Moroccan soldiers. Some 220,000 individuals fled as refugees to Angola. Some 4,000 Katangan rebels led by General Mbumba invaded the Shaba province from Angolan territory on May 11, 1978. Zaire requested assistance from France, Belgium, the US, and China on May 14, 1978. France decided to deploy troops in support of Zaire on May 17, 1978. Some 1,200 French troops and 1,750 Belgium troops were airlifted by US military aircraft and 100 US personnel to Zaire on May 18-20, 1978. French troops and Belgium troops were replaced by the *African Intervention Force *(AIF) beginning on June 5, 1978, consisting of some 2,700 troops from Morocco (1,511 soldiers), Senegal (500 soldiers), Central African Empire (300 soldiers), Togo (159 soldiers), Ivory Coast (110 medical personnel), Egypt (60 soldiers), and Gabon (44 soldiers). US military aircraft transported the AIF to Zaire, as well as military trucks and jeeps from Togo on June 13, 1978. Four French soldiers were killed during the military hostilities. President Mobutu and President Neto of Angola signed the *Brazzaville Agreement* on July 28, 1978, which provided for the ending of subversive activities by the countries. The AIF was withdrawn on August 14, 1979.

The second rivalry between the two states revolves around the internal instability within Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) as well as within Angola. It began in late 1994. While the early disputes in this rivalry deal with President Mobutu's support of the Angolan rebel group called the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)-MID4071, the later ones had to do with Angolan involvement in the Congo's civil war. 

MID4071 Angolan aircraft accidentally bombed a Zairean military base on or around 10/18/94. Angola apologized immediately, citing bad weather as the cause. Zaire sent 200+ troops to the Angolan border in response to the incident. Reports indicate that Zairean troops harassed Angolan citizens, but no military fatalities were reported. MID4168 occurred on May 13, 1995, when an Angolan soldier was killed near the Angola-Congo border after he killed 2 villagers. In retaliation, Angolan soldiers crossed into Congo and engaged in battle with Congolese Army soldiers. The battle appears to have been short lived and did not escalate.

In May of 1997, rebel forces led by Laurent Kabila overthrew the regime of President Mobutu in Zaire after 32 years. Heavy fighting between the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), led by Kabila and the former rebel group from Angola, UNITA occurred throughout that month MID4244. The fighting ended after May, 1997, as Kabila took over the command of the government and changed the country's name on May 20, 1997. MID4246 Angola intervened in the Congolese civil war on behalf of rebel forces. Angola and the rebel forces took control of the capital on 05/20/97, effectively ending the civil war and this MID. The Angolan government had fought against Mobutu Sese Seko in the First Congo War because of his support for rebel UNITA in the Angolan Civil War. The Angolan government wanted to eliminate UNITA operations in southern Congo, which exchanged diamonds extracted from rebel-held Angola for foreign weapons. Angola had no confidence that a new president would be more effective than Kabila, and feared that continued fighting would lead to a power vacuum that could only help UNITA. The intervention of the experienced Angolan forces was essential to decide the outcomes of both wars. 

While Rwanda and Uganda had supported Kabila throughout his campaign to overthrow Mobutu, he soon distanced himself from these countries in an effort to gain more domestic support. In 1998, Kabila unilaterally announced an end to military cooperation with Uganda and Rwanda. These two countries orchestrated another attempted rebellion in that same year. By August, the rebels had captured a large area of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In response, Kabila formed alliances with Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Angola to fight against the insurgents. With the change of regime and Kabila's take-over of DR Congo, the relations between Angola and DR Congo got closer and closer. This continued even after Joseph Kabila's death and the take-over of his son, Laurent Kabila.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Angola became independent on November 11, 1975. The first rivalry between Angola and Zaire stemmed from the overarching Cold War environment of the period. Angola was ruled by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) shortly after its independence. This was a leftist regime. Mobutu of Zaire backed the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) against this regime from the beginning. Further, there was a territorial dispute over the Shaba Province, which lies inside Zaire but borders Angola. It is an area rich in copper (at the time providing Zaire with 2/3 of its foreign earnings). 

There were disputes in the Shaba Province throughout the first half of 1976-MID1441, although President Mobutu of Zaire and Dr. Neto of Angola normalized relations between the two countries on February 23 of that year.

In March of 1977, rebel groups in Zaire had taken control of the Shaba Province-MID2150. The rebels were believed to be communists, backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba. President Mobutu of Zaire accused Angola of backing the rebels as well, although Angola denied it. In early May, President Mobutu retook the area with the backing of Moroccan forces. There was substantial fighting in this effort throughout May, 1977, and several other countries became involved (including Uganda, Congo-Brazzaville, the Central African Republic, Egypt, and France). 220,000 refugees fled to Angola as a result of this conflict.

The Shaba Province was again invaded in May, 1978 by 4,000 rebels led by General Mbumba, and launched from Angola-MID3011. There were interventions by forces from France and Belgium, and then by an African Intervention Force. Hostilities ended when the leaders of Zaire and Angola signed the Brazzaville Agreement on July 28, 1978. Some 500,000 refugees were repatriated at the time to both countries. This ended the first of the two rivalries that Angola and Zaire are identified as being involved in. There were no more hostilities until 1994, indicating that the agreement of 1978 settled the existing cause of hostilities.

The second rivalry between the two states revolves around the internal instability within Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) as well as within Angola. It began in late 1994. While the early disputes in this rivalry deal with President Mobutu's support of the Angolan rebel group called the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)-MID4071, the later ones had to do with Angolan involvement in the Congo's civil war.

The intervention of the experienced Angolan forces was essential to decide the outcomes of both wars.

While Rwanda and Unganda had supported Kabila throughout his campaign to overthrow Mobutu, he soon distanced himself from these countries in an effort to gain more domestic support. In 1998, Kabila unilaterally announced an end to military cooperation with Uganda and Rwanda. These two countries orchestrated another attempted rebellion in that same year. By August, the rebels had captured a large area of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In response, Kabila formed alliances with Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Angola to fight against the insurgents. This war continued on through June 3, 2001, killing over 2 million people. Each of the countries has fought some political reasons, but mainly in an effort to plunder valuable resources from Congo such as gold, diamonds, and copper. The money from these resources has mainly gone to the personal accounts of the respective leaders of each of the countries. Much of the fighting has been rationalized along ethnic conflicts.

On August 26, 1978, Angola and Zaire announced an agreement following a three-day visit by the Angolan President Neto to the Zairian President Mobutu. The rulers of Angola and Zaire have solemnly agreed that they will not in future help rebellions against each other. Zaire's Mr Mobutu has been assisting two groups of rebels operating in the north of Angola and, to a lesser extent, the more important Unita guerrilla movement fighting in the southern half of the country. Angola's Mr Neto has provided asylum, and probably armed assistance from his resident Cubans, for the rebels who have invaded Zaire's southern province of Shaba twice in the past 16 months. All this will now cease, in theory; its cessation will be checked by a supervisory commission which, poor thing, will have 1,300 miles of border to supervise; and, in theory again, Zaire's copper (and Zambia's) can start moving down Angola's Benguela railway to the port of Lobito. There are two difficulties, apart from the fact that Mr Neto and Mr Mobutu made the same promise to each other back in 1976, and look what didn't happen. The first is that only one of the three rebel movements operating against Angola-the one run by Mr Holden Roberto, a relative of President Mobutu-is wholly dependent on Zairean help, and the others may try to soldier on with clandestine assistance from other friends. The anti-Zaire rebels based in Angola, on the other hand, are probably powerless without Angolan and Cuban help. But will Mr Neto and the Cubans really withhold that help if those other two insurrections in Angola sputter on? The other problem is that, whereas the end of the threat to Shaba (if it does end) will make it possible for Mr Mobutu to do without the small Moroccan force now guarding that province, Mr Neto refuses to dispense with the much larger Cuban force which enables him to stay in control of Angola. He has made it clear that this week's agreement with Zaire will not lead to its departure. This means that Angola's regime, unlike Zaire's, is still dependent on a foreign military garrison. It also means that the Cubans, who may have aims of their own in southern Africa, will still be in a position to pursue those aims.

On October 16, 1978, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire began a two-day visit to Luanda, Angola, aimed at improving relations with neighboring Zaire. Last May Mobutu accused the Angolan government of aiding rebel Lunda tribesmen who attacked Zaire's copper-mining province of Shaba. "We are going to use this occasion of consolidate our relations by all means possible," said Mobutu on Radio Luanda. On October 27, 1978, Zaire and Angola signed a series of treaties on cooperation in trade, transport, the harnessing of Zaire river, fishing and a mutual exchange of refugees who are willing to return home. The treaties were signed after the recent exchange of visits and negotiations between the heads of state and specialists of Zaire and Angola. An Angolan delegation, led by the third deputy prime minister of Angola Podro de Castro von Dunemm, visited Zaire from October 23 to 25, 1978, and signed these treaties with the Zairian government. The Zaire agency reported that in a statement on his return from a meeting in Angola of railway delegations from Zambia, Zaire and Angola, the operations manager of Zaire's national railway had said rail traffic between Zaire and Angola would be resumed on 1st September, 1979. 

On June 26, 1983, the presidents of Zaire, Zambia and Angola met at Lubumbashi in southern Zaire to discuss border security and ways of improving the communication links among the three countries. A communique issued after the summit said the three presidents, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, discussed the rehabilitation of the Transangolan Benguela railway line, which is one of the region's major economic life-lines linking the Zairean and Zambian copper belts to Lobito, the Angolan west coast port. The railway line has been subjected to attacks by guerrillas of the national union for the total independence of Angola that remains active since the 1975 Angolan war. The attacks have blocked mineral exports from Zaire and Zambia. The communique said the three leaders also discussed the border security of their countries. It said the presidents condemned the South African regime for its continued occupation of southern Angola. The presidents of Zaire and Zambia expressed their support to the Angolan government. This was the second tripartite summit on matters of common interest. The first summit was held in Zambia in 1982.

On 30th January, 1985, Zaire said that it would like ''an appropriate framework to be set up and strengthened for regular meetings'' with Angola to enable them to discuss border security, the head of the Zairean delegation announced at the fourth session of the bilateral joint commission which began in Kinshasa. Zaire is concerned with the maintenance of ''the policy of good-neighborliness'' and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states,'' Lengema Dulia, Secretary of State for International Cooperation, said in his opening speech. This meeting precedes an official visit to Kinshasa by the Angolan President, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, probably in early February 1985, according to reliable sources. ''Taking into account the initial difficulties, relations between Zaire and Angola may be cited as an example in Africa of the result of a determination on the part of both countries to improve their bilateral relations,'' according to Zairean official sources, in view of the Shaba wars of 1977 and 1978 and the accusations each country made against the other about the harboring of armed opponents to their respective regimes-UNITA, for Luanda, and the ''Katangans'' for Zaire. Mr Lengema also explored the insufficient amount of trade that is carried out between the two countries and hoped that an agreement on border trade would be reached during the meeting. Kinshasa would also like negotiations on fishing between the two countries to end conclusively, the Secretary of State said, in reference to the project for the creation of a joint fishing company. His Angolan counterpart, Carlos Antonio Fernandes, merely remarked that great development potential exists in both countries. 

From February 6th to 9th, 1985, Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos made an official visit to Zaire where he met with Zaire's President Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko. During a banquet hosted in honor of the Angolan President, the two Heads of State toasted each other and expressed their determination jointly to contribute towards strengthening the centuries' old and common blood ties existing between the two countries in conformity with the spirit and principles of the Angolan-Zairean communique of 28th February 1976. The two parties particularly stressed security along the border and the development of bilateral exchanges in the trade, fishing and transport sectors. On the bilateral plane, the two sides signed: (a) an accord on defense and security; (b) an accord on the movement of persons and goods; (c) an accord on border trade and customs cooperation; (d) an accord on the conservation of common natural resources; (e) an accord on health and medical cooperation; and (f) an education program for 1985-86 which is part of the cultural and scientific agreement signed in Kinshasa on 29th December 1981. The two parties agreed to exchange very quickly ratification instruments of the general economic, scientific, social and cultural agreement signed in Luanda on 17th October 1978 and the trade agreement signed in Kinshasa on 25th October 1978.During his stay in Zaire the President of the People's Republic of Angola toured the Hinga hydroelectric dam, the Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko bridge on the Zaire river and the agricultural and industrial complex of the historic town of Nsele. Bilateral relations between Angola and Zaire have reflected a greater cooperation in the field of transport since the last visit by the Angolan Head of State to the Republic of Zaire. Accordingly, the Angolan-Zairean joint commission for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the navigable stretch of the Zaire River ended its working session in Luanda on February 26, 1985. The participants assessed the proceedings of the previous session, which noted the positive results of the activities that have been carried out since the last session in 1979. The joint commission outlined new actions designed to strengthen existing cooperation between Angola and Zaire in maintaining the navigable stretch of the Zaire River. The proceedings deal with navigation, dredging and hydrographic studies. 

On 6th June, 1986, Miguel Gaspar Neto, Ambassador of the People's Republic of Angola to Zaire, has spoken about Zairean-Angolan relations, the critical situation created by UNITA in the southern part of his country and the possibilities of reopening the Benguela railroad. In this connection the Angolan ambassador reaffirmed that his country's relations with Zaire are good and that they have continued to be strengthened. On the importance of the Angolan community in Zaire, Miguel Gaspar Neto acknowledged that Zaire had for a long time now sheltered nearly 50,000 Angolans residing in the Bas-Zaire, Bandundu and Shaba regions as well as in Kinshasa. On their eventual return home, the Angolan ambassador to Zaire noted that every one of these Angolans was free to return home or to continue to live in Zaire, and that the same applied to Zaireans living in Angola. Speaking on the critical situation caused by UNITA in the southern part of the country, Miguel Gaspar Neto stated that UNITA would no longer exist but for the support of South Africa, which is determined to destabilize Angola. Gaspar Neto stressed that the bases claimed by UNITA, whose elements avoid confronting the FAPLA, do not exist at all. This rebel movement has no revolutionary aim, rather it is a group committed to doing evil. The Ambassador spoke at length on the need to reopen the Benguela rail-way. He confirmed his country's determination to reopen this railway in the near future, in the interest not only of Angola, but also of neighboring countries, in particular Zaire and Zambia. The Angolan Ambassador recalled that the inactivity of this important railway was due to the attacks of UNITA. UNITA's aim of attacking the rail-way was to penalize the countries that used it.

Angola hopes that the forthcoming summit between Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko will be a success, said the Angolan ambassador to Tanzania Eusebio Sebastiao junior on November 11, 1986. Sebastiao told reporters that the two presidents, scheduled to meet in Zaire on November 22, will discuss the security situation along the common border of the two countries. The meeting, which may be attended by other frontline states leaders, was planned during the four-nation summit of president K. Kaunda of Zambia, president Santos of Angola, the late president Samora Machel of Mozambique and president Mobutu of Zaire in Zambia on October 19,1986 . Angola and other frontline states are very much concerned over the activities of the anti-government "national union for total independence of Angola" (unita), and have complained about zaire's reported permission of a passage for American military supply to the South Africa-backed UNITA forces. Zaire has denied the charge.

On November 28, 1986, Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has warned that he might send troops into neighboring Zaire in pursuit of US-backed rebels trying to topple his Government. Such a move would expand the 11-year Angolan war beyond the country's boundaries and would further complicate efforts to end the fighting that now engulfs much of southern Angola. At his sprawling, heavily fortified presidential compound on the outskirts of Luanda, Mr Dos Santos expressed deepening frustration with Zaire's inability to control the rebel support bases. "We do not now cross the border in hot pursuit," he said. But, he said, if the "dimension" of the rebel incursions into Angola grew, he would not hesitate to do so. 

Angola's president Jose Eduardo dos Santos said on May 13, 1987, that his government is deeply concerned about a recent military infiltration from neighboring Zaire. The newspaper "Angola' quoted the president as saying in a speech in Angola's northern Uije province bordering Zaire that armed units from Zaire had disrupted life in the province. The Angolan government will continue to try to solve the problem through negotiations with Zaire's government, he added. In Addis Ababa on December 4, 1987, Angolan External Relations Minister Afonso Van Dunem gave a press conference in which he discussed the main issues in southern Africa's situation. Naturally, he emphasized the situation in southern Angola in the wake of the South African army's invasion of our territory. Van Dunem said the following: We have given some photographs to the press. This material reveals which forces have been destabilizing our country. Lately, forces of destabilization have received support from a number of countries. This is clearly shown in the photographs. Our country has noted that certain African countries are being used to ensure that the destabilisation of Angola continues. As we have seen, these photographs reveal that we have seized war material from UNITA and that this war material came in boxes with the inscription Matadi, Zaire. This proves UNITA has been using our country's northern border with Zaire to infiltrate war material and attack Angolan civilians. By bringing this evidence to the press, we are alerting the international community in general and Africa, to these activities, which must cease. We have diplomatic relations with the Republic of Zaire. We have signed defense and security accords with Zaire. However, the facts show that our northern border with Zaire is being used by the terrorists in the pay of South Africa. They take advantage of this situation to bring death and destabilisation to our country. The Angolan government does not intend to open yet another military front with Zaire, (our northern neighbor). Nonetheless, there is positive evidence that the UNITA puppet gang uses the northern border to sow death and grief and continue destabilizing our country from the north.

Angola and Zaire have agreed to hold high-level talks soon to further ease tension between the two neighbors caused by the presence of the bases of the anti-government national union for total independence of Angola (UNITA) in Zaire, Zambian "Daily Mail" reported on March 30, 1989. The paper quoted outgoing Angolan ambassador to Zambia Luis Neto Kiambata as saying that during the Angola-Zaire summit whose venue and date are yet to be announced, Angola would ask Zaire to dismantle UNITA bases which are being used by the rebels against Angola. "All we want is peace and I am confident relations between Angola and Zaire will be better" after the official talks, he added.

On June 21, 1990, Angola has accused Zaire of providing military assistance to the UNITA (national union for total independence of angola) rebel group and repositioning the military positions of its armed forces. The Angolan armed forces said that on June 15 a Zairean military plane intruded into the airspace of the city of Maquela do Zambo in Uije province and on the following day a hercules-c-130 from Zaire intruded into the airspace of Kundi-Dia-Base in Angola's Malanje province three times. The military planes intruded into Angola's airspace in an attempt to provide military assistance to UNITA forces and find out military positions of the Angolan armed forces, it said. Angola often accuses Zaire of violations of its airspace and assisting the UNITA in its 15-year-old war against the Luanda government. The Angolan government has rejected allegations that its forces are preparing for armed invasion of Zaire. In a statement issued on October 12, 1990, the Angolan department of information said that allegations made by the Zaire national press agency was "a conspiracy of countercharge", aimed at making people forget the role Zaire has played in supporting the anti-government national union for the total independence of Angola (UNITA). The statement also charged that Zaire intends to create favorable psychological conditions for the direct involvement of the Zairese armed forces in northern and northwestern Angola. It said that Zaire continues to allow the military equipment provided by US to UNITA to pass via Zaire, and permit UNITA to set up bases along the border line so that the UNITA rebels could easily infiltrate into Angola. "People have kept it in mind that the aircraft and helicopters taking off from the Zairese Kamina bases frequently invade the Angolan air space in support of UNITA," added the statement. A plane from Zaire violated Angola's air space on December 18, 1990, flying over the Angolan province of Zaire, the headquarters of the general staff of Angola people's liberation armed forces announced. The plane returned to the republic of Zaire later on the day, the announcement said.

On January 22, 1993, the Angolan government expressed concern at the involvement of Zairean soldiers in the Angolan war alongside UNITA soldiers. A government protest note was presented to Nkolo Nkoku, First Counsellor of the Zairean embassy in Angola, who represented his ambassador. Nkolo Nkoku denied Zaire's direct involvement in the matter, saying Zaire would not endanger the atmosphere of good neighborliness between the two countries. He admitted, however, that high-ranking Zairean officials have given assistance to UNITA. On February 1, 1993, Zaire has strongly rejected Angolan government allegations that its troops have been fighting alongside forces of the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in several Angolan provinces. Zaire's Ambassador to Angola, Mundini Didi Kilengo, accused the Angolan Government of using "Stalinist methods" in its attacks on Zaire, which he said had started when government forces had begun to lose ground to Unita. The ambassador stressed that no independent sources had confirmed Angola's allegations, and claimed that all witnesses provided to date "lacked credibility."

Trade volume between Zaire and Angola has doubled in the last few months despite the Angolan civil war, Zairean press agency reported on March 1, 1993. The report said that trade in more than a dozen of commodities has been going on between Luanda, capital of Angola, and two cities in West Zaire, Muanda and Boma. Since the Angolan civil war resumed in September 1991, trade between Zaire and Angola has been limited between Luanda and west Zaire.

Zaire has deployed six army battalions at the border with the oil-rich Angolan enclave of Cabinda in preparation for an offensive, the Angolan government daily Jornal de Angola reported on May 31, 1993. The newspaper stated that "some units" of the Angolan rebel UNITA movement were stationed with the Zairean troops, massed in the Muanda region of Zaire and ready for an attack. Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) planned "to fight for control of Cabinda and Zaire province" in the far north of Angola following the collapse of peace talks between the rebels and the Luanda government, the paper charged. UNITA seized control last week of the oil town of Soyo in Zaire province, Angola's second most important oil-producing zone after Cabinda. The Cabinda enclave lies north of Angola proper, between Congo and a strip of southern Zairean territory.

The press claim coincided with the second anniversary of a peace pact signed in Portugal on May 31, 1991, which had been intended to end the civil war that ravaged Angola following independence in 1975. In a statement to mark the occasion, the government declared that the country had been plunged back "into a state of general warfare" and announced that it would fight UNITA "at the cost of sacrifice to the threshold of the impossible." Renewed fighting broke out last year after UNITA refused to accept the result of a U.N.-supervised general election it lost to the ruling People's Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA).

Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos plans to meet his Zairian counterpart, Mobutu Sese Seko, to improve relations between the two neighboring African countries, government sources said in Luanda on June 28, 1994. Although no date or venue were given, Angolan radio indicated the historic bilateral summit would take place in "a Southern African country." Speaking on the state-run national radio, a spokesman for the Angolan presidency confirmed arrangements for the summit were in progress after Kinshasa backed the proposed meeting. Contacted by IPS, Zaire's ambassador in Luanda, Mundidid Didi Kilengo, would not confirm a meeting was planned, but emphasized Kinshasa welcomed such an initiative as part of "the framework we are working within to create better relations between our two countries." Didi Kilengo said despite persistent government allegations that Zaire was backing the rebel National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA), no concrete proof had ever been provided. "Rather than waiting for something which will never come, it is better to seek a reorientation," he said, adding that the meeting would contribute "a new dimension and a new dynamic" to the Angolan peace process. Luanda, which has been fighting the rebels since independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, has frequently accused Zaire of direct involvement in the Angolan civil war on the side of UNITA. It has claimed the Mobutu regime shelters UNITA guerrillas, flouts U.N. arms and fuel embargoes and facilitates the smuggling of rebel movement's diamonds, which bankrolls UNITA's war effort. The government also alleges that Zaire even sends troops to fight alongside UNITA, most recently in an offensive against the north-western Angolan town of Ndalatando. More than one million people have been killed, another million maimed and several million displaced within the Southern African country of 10 million, directly and indirectly, because of the 18-year war. Speaking at the recent Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, President dos Santos made clear Angola's antipathy towards Zaire as the biggest African supporter of UNITA and called for sanctions against the former Belgian colony. While the United States and other Western nations have confirmed that UNITA continues to receive support from Kinshasa, they admit the Zaire-Angola frontier is practically impossible to police and little leverage can be exercised against Mobutu, once a firm ally of Washington. 

In their first known meeting in five years, the presidents of Zaire and Angola agreed on July 7, 1994, to lay aside differences and work together to end Angola's 19-year-old civil war. South African President Nelson Mandela brought the two leaders together, at the request of the United Nations, to try to break a negotiations deadlock. Zaire, Angola's eastern neighbor, is a longtime ally of rightist UNITA rebels fighting the Angolan government. President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola agreed to hold talks on the Angolan conflict. Optimally, those talks will induce Mobutu to push his friend, Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, to meet dos Santos to discuss peace. Seven months of U.N.-mediated negotiations have stalled over how dos Santos' government and Savimbi's rebels would share power in a postwar administration. More than 500,000 people have been killed since the Angolan civil erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975. Also at the meeting was President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique which, like Angola, suffered a long civil war after independence from Portugal. A brief statement issued after the meeting said Angola and Zaire agreed to revive meetings of a joint commission of defense and security officials next week and set up a summit between dos Santos and Mobutu. Mobutu and dos Santos had not met since the Zairean leader launched an abortive Angolan peace initiative in 1989.

Helping to broker an end to one of Africa's longest and bloodiest conflicts would boost the international standing of Mobutu, who has been ostracized for blocking democratic reforms in Zaire. The war was briefly halted by a May 1991 peace accord. But when Savimbi lost elections in September 1992, he declared the vote a fraud and went back to war, capturing large chunks of the country.

The meeting of the Angola-Zaire technical defense and security commission ended in the city of Cabinda on July 19, 1994. The two delegations discussed issues relating to the alleged involvement of the Republic of Zaire in the Angolan war on the side of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola. The Angolan authorities and other sources have repeatedly condemned Zaire's involvement in the Angolan dispute. At the meeting, Gen Pedro Maria Tonha Pedale took the opportunity to once again condemn Zaire's involvement. 

The Angolan government has apologized to Zaire after its air force bombarded a Zairean army camp in which one person was killed, reports said on October 21, 1994. Zairean television quoted Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Mario Tonha Pedale as saying that the incident had occurred because of unfortunate circumstances. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported that the Angolan minister handed Zaire a formal apology during a visit to the Zairean capital Kinshasa. Pedale said Angolan pilots bombed the army base of Kitona near the coastal city of Muanda because of a mistake during bad weather conditions. There has been no major incident along the Angolan-Zairean border for some time although Angola has repeatedly accused Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko of supporting the Angolan rebel movement UNITA.

After years of bitter rivalry, Angola and the former Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), seem to have started a new era in their relationship though this is amid the widespread skepticism of local public opinion. After the take-over of Kinshasa on May 20, 1997, Angolan forces and the new regime of DRC, led by Kabila, forged a strong alliance. The Angolan authorities appear to believe that the ousting of former Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko, one of the most influential allies of the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, will help bring peace back to the country and pave the way for major political and economic stability in the whole southern Africa region. The most important reason for such optimism lies in CDR's Laurent-Desire Kabila's seemingly successful achievement in putting an end to the 30 years regime of what was Angola's most hostile neighbor. In fact, the fall of the Mobutu regime was welcomed by almost all leaders in southern Africa and in the so-called Great Lakes States, due to Zaire's foreign policy of "successive interference" with its neighbors' home affairs. This helped Kabila's rebellion find unprecedented strong support from the surrounding nations, including Angola, which earlier denied accusations that it was supplying the anti-Mobutu guerrillas with men and war material. Only on August 5 this year, and for the first time since the conflict broke out in Zaire in October 1996, did Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos publicly confirm the support his government extended to Kabila in his 8-month bid to topple Mobutu. Mobutu was widely blamed for fuelling the war in Angola by providing assistance to Savimbi's UNITA guerrillas. Even after the Organization of African Unity (OAU), recommended that the MPLA and the FNLA movement of Holden Roberto join a "Supreme Council" for Angola's liberation struggle, Mobutu banned MPLA fighters from using the borders of Zaire in their struggle against the Portuguese colonial rulers. Years later, after Angola's independence in 1975, Mobutu dropped the FNLA to back UNITA in their CIA masterminded campaign to fight the communist MPLA, then backed by Cuba and the former Soviet Union. As a result, the relationship between Angola and Zaire was of mutual hostility which prompted a climate of reciprocal xenophobia between the ordinary citizens of the two The MPLA-dominated government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos believes things with Kabila will be different. "Your presence here translates naturally into the mutual desire to begin a new era in the relations between the two countries and states," said Dos Santos, welcoming Kabila on his first official state visit to Angola on August 5, 1997. He said Angola and the Congo Democratic Republic "should hand in hand look to the future and together address the challenges of the next millennium". Dos Santos told his guest that his government stood by Kabila's side (during the Zaire war) because they were conscious that "you were representing a positive action towards peace, regional stability, freedom, equality and justice". For his part, the CDR head of State said he had come to thank the Angolan government for its support. "This visit is a great occasion to thank the people and the government of Angola for the moral, diplomatic, political and material support you extended to us during the struggle which led to the liberation of Congo," Kabila said. The visit produced a global cooperation agreement between the two states with emphasis on the issue of common border security. Under the agreement, Angola has offered to provide training for CDR police officers in Luanda so that they can then return to their own country and train others. The attitude of the new authorities in the former Zaire will no doubt influence the events in the southern Africa region in general and in Angola in particular. The future will tell to what extent.

On July 11, 1999, it has been decided at the inter-ministerial meeting between the governors of the provinces of Zaire and Lower Zaire that local authorities should increase cooperation to effectively control the border between Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Held in the oil town of Soyo, the meeting discussed security along the border area. Cabinda Province Governor Amaro Tatty and Mwete Joao Baptista, Angola's ambassador to DR Congo, attended the meeting as observers. Seraphin Banvuidi, governor of Lower Zaire Province, said that stern measures would be taken to control the border area. The immigration departments of the two provinces have a role to play in identifying extraneous persons.

The presidents of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe-key allies of the assassinated President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila-are holding urgent talks in the Angolan capital, Luanda on January 22, 2001. They have all pledged to continue supporting the former Zaire following the death of Kabila, who was shot by one of his bodyguards. The body of Laurent Kabila has meanwhile arrived back in Kinshasa from the south-eastern city of Lubumbashi, the capital of his home province of Katanga. Thousands of mourners lined the route from the airport, many wearing T-shirts bearing his image. Kabila's body is expected to lie in state in Kinshasa's People's Palace before being buried on Tuesday-a week after his assassination. The Zimbabwean leader, Robert Mugabe, left Harare to attend the Luanda meeting. He is expected to be joined by President Sam Nujoma of Namibia and the Angolan leader, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The three countries sent thousands of troops to help the late President in his fight against rebels in the east, who are supported by Rwanda and Uganda. But the three allies' support for Kabila's forces made little impact on the rebels' advance.

On May 8, 2001, Rwandan forces and Banyamulenge rebels from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which assisted UNITA National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in the invasion of Zaire Province in 1998, are trapped along the banks of the Cuango Cuo River in the Massau Communal Area of Uige Province. This is due to mopping operations currently being carried out by the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) in the area. According to Actual, special forces have been deployed on the border with the DRC, on the banks of the Cuango Cuo River. Special forces this week captured nine unarmed foreign soldiers fleeing from Angolan government forces in Casa Branca, Lusitano and Massau, in the Provinces of Malanje and Uige. The Angolan minister of defence, Kundi Paihama, stated on October 3, 2001 that his country's armed forces were already preparing to leave neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), although the Kinshasa government had requested an initial review of the situation on the two country's common border, Lusa reported. Paihama was speaking to journalists in Luanda, following a meeting with UN specialists who are examining the illegal exploitation of the DRC's natural resources, particularly diamonds. 

Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda will hold a quadripartite meeting in Luanda on 8 January 2002. The meeting will deal with the situation in the DRC. Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda disclosed this today as he received Andre Bumaya, his Rwandan counterpart, and Ugandan Defense Minister Amama Mbabazi. Speaking to correspondents, Minister Miranda said: "For some time now, we have been promising that there would be a meeting involving the three countries bordering the DRC, and the DRC government itself." He noted that in the past, Angola, Uganda and Rwanda backed the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire in its struggle against the Mobutu regime. Added Minister Miranda: The alliance bore fruit as seen in the toppling of the regime, "but subsequently there were differences and the alliance crumbled". According to Minister Miranda, the quadripartite meeting will also discuss relations among the four countries so as "to see if one can speed up the return to peace in the DRC, and the resumption of political relations among Angola, Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC". Minister Miranda noted that Angola, Rwanda, and Uganda were signatories to the Lusaka Accord and were directly involved in the peace process in the DRC. In view of this, he added, the three countries were concerned about finding lasting peace in the DRC. Joao Miranda said that common ground had been reached, and that it would be deepened so that the presidents of the four countries could meet and iron out an agreement for the restoration of peace in the DRC as soon as possible.

Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, which have supported the Kinshasa government during the past four years of war against rebel forces backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, said on 24 October, 2002, that the final withdrawal of their armed forces from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) would take place by 31 October, 2002. The announcement came at the end of a one-day summit hosted by DR Congolese President Joseph Kabila and attended by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Namibian President Sam Nujoma, and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. In a joint statement, the four allied nations also called for the strengthening of the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the DRC, known as MONUC, and the verification of the withdrawal of Rwandan armed forces. They also voiced their support for the holding of an international conference on peace and development in the Great Lakes region of Africa. The allied leaders urged Kabila to persevere in his efforts to reach national reconciliation through the resumption of negotiations leading to the formation of an all-inclusive, power-sharing transitional government and the eventual holding of national democratic elections. "We are convinced that President Kabila will continue to make every effort to move the inter-Congolese dialogue forward towards achieving a durable peace, which is key to stability," dos Santos said at the end of the summit. The inter-Congolese dialogue, which ended in April 2002 in Sun City, South Africa, with agreement reached among a majority of participants, was due to resume in Pretoria, South Africa. Representatives were expected from all Congolese parties to the conflict.

Angolan foreign minister Joao Bernardo Miranda begins a working visit to Kinshasa on October 10, 2003, the country's ambassador Joao Batista Mawete announced after an audience with DR Congo's foreign minister Antoine Ghonda. According to Mawete, the objective of the visit is to further enhance the already good relations between Angola and the DRC, adding that the Congolese and Angolan people are together under all circumstances. The two ministers will assess the relations between Luanda and Kinshasa and analyze all agreements signed by the two parties, which would strengthen the cooperation links between the two capitals. Angola deployed troops in the DRC for over four years during which they prevented the seizure of power in Kinshasa by Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda-backed rebel groups operating in the country's east. The training of Congolese police and army officers in Luanda has further cemented cooperation between the two neighboring countries. Meanwhile, the Angola oil company, Sonangol, operates several petrol stations with the DRC. Residents on both sides of the common border easily cross into each other's territory. The cross-border movement is expected to intensify further when the Benguela-Lobito railway is re-opened within one or two years. Half of the railway, closed during the 25-year old civil war in Angola, is currently operational. It is the safest and cheapest route to the sea for DRC's mineral rich Katanga and two Kasai provinces. 

On May 4, 2004, Angolan Head of State Jose Eduardo dos Santos granted a collective audience to government officials from Congo-Brazzaville, Congo-Kinshasa and Angola, which focused on matters linked to the implementation of the tripartite mechanism of political and security cooperation. The foreign ministers of Congo-Brazzaville and Angola respectively, Rodolfo Adada and Joao Miranda, as well as the home minister of Congo-Kinshasa, Theophile Mbemba, are on a tripartite meeting in relation to the referred mechanism, which was created in Luanda, in January 2003. Speaking to journalists at the end of the 30-minute audience, which he considered to be a "courtesy" one, Rodolfo Adada said that "we came to give to Mr President a brief report of the works in our meeting which aims at strengthening the mechanism of political and security cooperation." He informed that there were also discussed aspects connected with the situation in the Great Lakes region, having explained that the president "gave precise information regarding the participation of Angola in the foreseen international conference for this region". The unstable situation in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been a cause for concern. According to military sources in Luanda, an Angolan contingent has been deployed in the Bukavu area to assist DR Congo government forces. The source, who did not specify the number of soldiers sent to DR Congo, said the decision taken by the Luanda authorities was within the framework of the military cooperation accord between the two countries. The Angolan government has been following with concern the latest political and military developments in DR Congo. The complex peace process in that country has been experiencing difficulties. Meanwhile, Lino Bernardo Tito, a PRS opposition Social Renewal Party MP, has reported the presence of DR Congo soldiers in Lunda Norte Province. Tito, who recently made a working visit to that province, told correspondents in Luanda that DRC soldiers from the Katanga region, calling themselves the tigers, had been receiving military training from the Angolan army. The Luanda authorities have not as yet commented on Tito's claims and on the latest developments in the DRC. DRC President Joseph Kabila treats Angola as his main foreign ally. Angolan forces ensured the survival of the Kinshasa regime during the war with rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda. Meanwhile, sources with the Office of the President in Luanda told Radio France Internationale today that Angola had not been involved militarily in DR Congo.

The Congolese and Angolan foreign ministers have been holding talks at the AU center in Kinshasa on 19 May, 2004. Angolan Foreign Minister is Dr Joao Bernardo de Miranda] and Antoine Ghonda discussed security along the common border, migration and the fate of armed elements of Congolese origin who had fought in Angola. The meeting which was attended by the governor of the neighboring Angolan province of Cabinda and those of Bandundu and Bakongo in the DR Congo will enable a concerted solution to be found to the burning issue of expulsions which Congolese living in Angola were victims of.

Angola is unlikely to get involved in any military intervention in support of the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to an analyst with the Luanda-based think-tank, Centre for Strategic Studies on June 23, 2004. The analyst was responding to reports of rising tensions in the DRC and a trip to Kinshasa, capital of the DRC, by Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Joao Miranda this week. The Angolan Press Agency Angop quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson as describing the situation in the DRC as "worrying". Given the history of conflict in the region, when Rwandan and Ugandan forces backed rebels against the Kinshasa government, the think-tank's analyst noted that "the DRC will need all the allies it can get in the region". However, "The Angolan military will play no role in the DRC-we have not been involved there for a long time," he commented. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supported Kinshasa during several years of war against rebel forces backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Angola pulled its troops out of the DRC in 2002. The analyst added that any instability in the DRC "means the possibility of refugees coming into Angola, and arms trafficking at the border", which would burden Angola's limited resources to police its borders.

The Angolan government has said it would not send any troops to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) but Angola will help train Congolese troops, local media reported on June 28, 2004. Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda, who visited Kinshasa recently, was quoted as saying he has received a request for troops and police training from Congolese President Joseph Kabila. Angola's assistance to the DRC security forces would not be " isolated," Miranda said, as it is part of parallel training being prepared by France, Belgium and South Africa. Miranda said the unrest in eastern DRC has reached "alarming proportions" and has raised tension along the Congolese-Rwandan border.

Angola, together with Namibia and Zimbabwe, sent troops to the DRC in 1998 to back the Kinshasa government fighting the anti-government rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Early this month, renegade military commanders and their supporters seized the strategic town of Bukavu in eastern DRC for a week posing a threat to the fragile peace process in the vast central African country. Kabila's power-sharing transitional government, which includes former rebel factions and opposition party, remains deeply divided and has been unable to integrate former foes into a cohesive national army.
