In January 2002, Rwandan military units, backed by DRC rebels from Goma, attacked the town of Muyenyi in the Kindu province as a reprisal for fighting between Rwandan forces and Mayi Mayi rebels earlier in the year. This would begin a long string of attacks by Rwandan military forces on towns in the DRC, mostly in the Kivu region, for various reasons, but mostly under the umbrella of locating anti-government Rwandan rebels working from DRC. In March 2002, Rwandan military forces entered and attacked the village of Moliro in eastern DRC. DRC pulled out of peace talks with Rwanda because of the occupation. In early April 2002, Rwanda launched a military offensive, utilizing between 4,000 and 5,000 troops, in the South Kivu Province of DRC. In June 2002, Rwanda sends hundreds of troops to occupy and fight ethnic Tutsi RCD rebels in the Sud-Kivu region of the DRC. Beginning in September 2002, the periodic attacks on DRC territory became coupled with a lasting military occupation of much of the Kivu region by Rwandan military forces following the removal of Ugandan and Zimbabwean forces from the area as part of a regional truce. Although not stated clearly, this Rwandan occupation eventually ended. However, in October of 2002, DRC-backed militia units occupied the town of Bugarama near the Rwandan border. This prompted the Rwandan military to send thousands of troops and armored units back into DRC territory to reoccupy the town. The conflict seemingly lay dormant for the rest of 2002, but in March 2003 Rwandan accused Uganda of forming alliances with ñgenocidalî rebel groups in the DRC with the intent of attacking Rwanda. To that end, they threatened to send troops back into the DRC and occupy territory there with the intention of fighting such alliances, and amassed troops along the border with the DRC. This threat ultimately resulted in a new occupation of DRC territory, specifically the Kivu region, by Rwandan military units. Rwanda sent thousands of troops back to DRC and occupied much of eastern DRC, attacking and occupying the towns of Bingi, Butembo, Beni, Lubero, and Kanyabayonga. The DRC government protested the occupation of DRC territory by Rwandan military units. First day of dispute is listed on 1/25/2002 and last day of dispute is listed on 7/31/2002.

Following the incidents of MID4347, Rwanda engaged in a series of occupations of DRC territory in violation of the July 31, 2002 peace agreement. These occupations occurred due to what Rwanda claimed were the formation of alliances between Ugandan military forces and anti- Rwandan rebels based in DRC. It remains largely unclear for how long the occupations of DRC territory occurred. First day of dispute was on 9/4/2002 and last day of dispute was on 9/30/2003.

On April 24, 2004, Rwanda escalated action by invading the DRC Kivu region with the additional military forces and attacking the DRC towns of Masisi and Rutshuru while looking for Interahamwe rebels and occupying the territory. During the course of this occupation, Rwanda also continued to fortify its border with the DRC with thousands of additional troops. In August 2004, the fighting in DRC spilled over into neighboring Burundi, when Hutu extremist rebels, reportedly with the aid of Congolese military units, attacked a Tutsi refugee camp, killing 160 people. In response, both Rwanda and Burundi threatened to send troops into DRC territory to attack rebel bases in eastern Congo. At about the same time, the Burundian government accused soldiers from the DRC of firing their automatic weapons across the border at the Burundian military checkpoint at Gatumba. The dispute seemed mostly dormant until the end of November 2004, when Rwanda sent troops into DRC to attack and occupy the rebel-held villages of Goma, Beni, and Ikobo in eastern Congo. This prompted the DRC government to place its military forces on heightened alert for possible clashes with Rwandan military units. First day of dispute was on 4/24/2004 and last day of dispute was on 12/17/2004.

Violent cross-border artillery exchange between Rwandan and Zairean forces occurred in Sept. 1996 after shots were fired (possibly by Zairean rebels). Zaire has repeatedly accused Rwanda of supporting anti-government rebels in Zaire. By November, Rwanda was fully involved in the civil war in Zaire, fighting along side rebel forces. Rwanda remained in Zaire until May 1997. Rwandan officials fully admitted involvement in almost all of the key battles of the civil war. First day of dispute was on 9/22/1996 and last day of dispute was on 5/17/1997.

A peace agreement was reached on July 7, 1999 and signed by all six states (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe) on July 10, 1999. Two rebel groups signed later in August of 1999. However, the agreement was never fully implemented or adhered to and at some point denounced both by the rebel groups as well as Democratic Republic of Congo. The end date is set to June 3, 2001 as this is 6 months after the last codable incident. As for Chad it withdrew its troops following a peace agreement attempt on April 18, 1999. First day of dispute was on 8/00/1998 and last day of dispute was on 6/3/2001.


Tension as a result of the conflict in the DRC still continues to be an issue in the strained relationship between both contries. According to Uppsala Conflict Data Program, Rwanda is listed as backing M23 rebels in conflict against the Democratic Republic of Congo which started 9 May 2012 and lasted until 2013. Given the continued fighting in the DRC and accusations of aiding rebels, this period is coded as a lesser rivalry 0.25.
