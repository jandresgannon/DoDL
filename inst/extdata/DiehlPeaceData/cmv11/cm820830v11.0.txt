PS-UPDATE2020: Remains a lesser rivalry with unresolved and new maritime disputes and associated militarization. 	In June 2017, Malaysia filed an application for a revision to ICJ’s 2008 ruling in favor of Singapore over ownership of Pedra Branca (an island and the easternmost point of Singapore). That said, the ICJ did not change its decision: (https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/170) October 2018, maritime dispute when Malaysia unilaterally extended its territorial boundary at Jonor Bahru Port o	“The claim extends beyond the maritime border Malaysia unilaterally declared and reinstated in 1979 and 1999 respectively, marking the first time in almost 20 years that either side has attempted to shift the boundary. Malaysia has since deployed three maritime agency vessels to patrol the newly claimed area in an ‘occupation’ using non-military force” (https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/01/30/singapore-malaysia-relations-in-troubled-waters/

MARITMID-NOTES: MID3573 from Gibler 2018, in 1992 Malaysia detained two Singaporean vessels that crossed a disputed maritime border, and on another occasion Malaysian vessels entered the disputed waters.
