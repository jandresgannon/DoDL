In March of 2005, the Tajik military was placed on heightened alert along the Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan border to stop terrorist or criminal elements from crossing the border into the country. Later, in June of 2005, several Kyrgyz soldiers clashed with Tajik residents, with the ultimate outcome being that the soldiers were taken captive by the Tajik residents in their village. The fate of the soldiers is unknown. First day of dispute was on 3/23/2005 and last day of dispute was on 6/6/2005.
