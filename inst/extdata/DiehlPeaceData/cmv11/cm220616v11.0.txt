NARRATIVE-CR:

The rivalry between France and Tunisia took place form 1957 until the early 1960s. There were five mids between the two countries. All of the mids were bilateral. The issues were tension over continued French presence in Tunisa after independence and Tunisian support for and protection of Algerian troops in the French-Algerian War. 

After Tunisian independence in 1956, France retained substantial military installations within Tunisia. Rebels opposed to the French presence began attacks on the French military, and France alleged that the Tunisian government was complicit. Further, the French were engaged in a brutal war with Algerian nationalists from 1954 until 1962. The fighting often spilled over into Tunisia and Morocco. 

At the same time France was engaged in conflict with Algeria and Morocco in the North African War. French troops and Tunisian troops clashed along the Tunisian-Algerian border during French military pursuit of Algerian rebels from May 26 to June 7, 1957, resulting in the deaths of seven Tunisian soldiers. French troops and Tunisian troops clashed in the Gabes area on June 3-14, 1957, resulting in the deaths of eleven Tunisian soldiers and ten French soldiers. This constitutes MID1706. 

MID266 occurred from February 8, 1958 until June of 1958. Here a counterinsurgency operation was launched on Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef, a town on the Tunisian border. French bombers attacked the city. The Tunisian army responded by surrounding the Frenchy military installation and on February 13 lodged a complaint with the UN. There was also serious fighting in May of 1958 in Remada and Gabes causing several hundred casualties. In June the French agreed to withdraw all troops except the 12,000 stationed at Bizerte a northern coastal city. 

MID1796 occurred from February until August of 1959. On February 14, Tunisia alleged that French fighter aircraft had crossed the border on February 9, and attacked a group of Tunisians, causing three death and several casualties. Tunisa alleged that a similar incident occurred in April. France alleged a Tunisian incursion in May in which six French were killed. Further incidents occurred in July and August but the dispute eventually abated. Neither side attempted a mediated settlement. Further conflict occurred in 1960. 

MID1711 occurred from March through May of 1960. Here the French alleged that Tunisia permitted Algerian troops to encamp and conduct operations from Tunisian territory. This led to clashes between French and Tunisian troops and a small number of casualties. The French protested to the UN calling on the Tunisians to cease support to the Algerians. 

MID28 occurred from July through September of 1961 and is known as the Bizerte Crisis. There were protracted negotiations between the French and the Tunisians regarding complete withdrawal. During this period, France sought to extend the runway at Bizerte to accommodate more modern aircraft. This prompted Tunisia to intensify its efforts to gain an immediate withdrawal of all French units. On July 19, 1961 Tunisian naval vessels imposed a blockade on the base at Bizerte. Tunisia announced that it would fire on any French aircraft attempting to land at the base. Tunisia fired on several French aircraft and the French responded by strafing Tunisian troops. Demonstrators surrounded the base and the French responded by firing on them. A tense standoff ensued as the French attempted to take control of the city. The situation eased as a ceasefire was reached and the dispute eased over time as the French agreed to withdraw from Tunisia altogether. 

Several factors contributed to the termination of the rivalry between France and Tunisia. First, France was occupied with a number of other colonial issues during this period. France was engaged with a costly war of independence with neighboring Algeria. The conflict in Algeria lasted until 1962. Some of the fighting between France and Tunisia was a product of this conflict. Thus when it ended the motivation for French attacks against sympathetic Tunisian forces who harbored the FLN was eliminated. Another contributing factor to the end of the rivalry was the election of de Gaulle to power and the formation of the Fifth Republic in France. The constitution de Gaulle formed permitted him to weld significant power over policy direction which was a dramatic departure from the Fourth Republic who ruled more by consensus which led to difficulties in policy change. De Gaulle offered self determination to the Algerians a year after coming to power in 1959. De Gaulle began withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia in June of 1958. After the Bizerte crisis of 1961 normalization of relations took place slowly. Normalization of cultural and technical cooperation was announced in October of 1961. In April of 1963, extensive Tunisian French talks designed to extend cooperation opened in Paris. The talks resulted in new cultural and economic agreements between the two countries.

PS-NARRATIVE:

19610929-19631015 Transition 

The last MID of RIV572, MID1706, ended on June 17, 1958. In December 1961, French and Tunisian officials met to negotiate on several issues of contention: the Bizerte problem, the situation of French citizens in Tunisia, re-establishment of full diplomatic relations and the problem of the southern border of Tunisia. Throughout 1962 and 1963 the same issues were negotiated over and over again and while most issues were solved, the issue of Bizerte and the French military presence in Tunisia was the major problem. This was solved in 1963 with the departure of the last French soldiers. All throughout the transition periods the negotiations between the two parties were conducted in a manner of confidence and trust and the diplomatic relations were improved very fast. 

19631016-20069999 0.5

The last French soldiers left Tunisia on October 15, 1963. In the same year, the Tunisian government nationalized the properties of foreigners in Tunisia, thus taking over many of the French citizens' possessions there. However, there was no conflict created over this move and in 1965 the two countries started signing a number of cooperation agreements. 

In November 1975 took place the first visit by a French President to independent Tunisia. Valery Giscard D'Estaing signs a number of agreements in various fields and the statements made by the two presidents show two countries that coordinate their actions in the field of foreign policy. French Secretary of State for Defense, Jean-Jacques Beucler, paid an official visit to Tunisia from September 23 to 25, 1977. The two sides agreed to further strengthen the cooperation between the two countries in view of their common interests on security and peace in the Mediterranean. Secretary of State Beucler discussed questions of equipment and training of military personnel with Tunisian Secretary of State for National Defence Ahmed Bennour. On the question of training of military personnel, the two sides have agreed to increase the number of personnel of the French mission to Tunisia and the number of Tunisian military personnel to be trained in France. In June 1979 at the 7th French-Tunisian Mixed Commission For Cooperation, the Foreign Ministers of Tunisia and France took common positions regarding the Palestinian issue, apartheid and racial discrimination in Southern Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe, foreign intervention in Africa as well as expressing a desire to enhance the cooperation between the two countries. In October 1980, Raymond Barre, the French Prime Minister, said during his visit to Tunisia that France had agreed to the setting up of a Franco-Arab-Tunisian investment bank with 30% French, 30% Arab and 40% Tunisian capital. Tunisia had agreed to release 80% of the French assets frozen since 1954. In June 1989 French President Francois Mitterand made an official visit to Tunisia. During this visit he made it clear that all the `difficult' problems between the countries regarding the safety of Tunisian immigrant workers to France, were settled amicably, noting that such `difficult problems' between Tunisia and France are extremely rare. On the economic front, France is Tunisia's number one trading partner. In 1988, France supplied 27.6 percent of Tunisia's imports and absorbed 30.4 percent of its exports. In 1987, Tunisia's trade deficit with France amounted to around $277 million, while French financial aid for development programs and projects amounted to $140 million. In 1992, French President Francois Mitterrand flew to Tunisia for one day for a fence-mending trip that was his first to an Arab country since the Gulf war. Mr. Mitterrand, accompanied by three ministers, left Tunis after firming up close ties with Tunisia that were strained by Tunisia's support for Iraq.In 1995, France has set aside at least 1 billion francs ($203 million) for aid to Tunisia to demonstrate determination to remain the country's ''first economic partner,'' French President Jacques Chirac said. Chirac, who spoke to the Tunisian National Assembly as he wound up a two-day visit to North African nation, said the aid would help Tunisia modernize its economy as well as face market competition and the effects of two years of drought on rural areas. The French president lauded Tunisia for becoming the first Arab and first African country to enter an association with the European Union, saying the accord was ''a courageous and exemplary move.'' More than 350 French companies have economic interests in Tunisia. In 2003 with the occasion of a visit to Tunis by President Chirac, Le Quotidien de Tunis (Tunis Daily) agreed that relations between the two countries are "exemplary and privileged", adding that France and Tunisia share the same views on key international issues. "In the face of rising uncertainty and the tensions rocking the world, Tunisia and France both favour the wisdom of dialogue between peoples and militate in favour of international law, which is a rampart for preserving peace and stability in the world." French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy urged Tunisia to uphold press freedoms after a French journalist was attacked and a Belgian television crew was threatened in the capital Tunis. In 2006, French and Tunisian officials signed 90 million Euro (US$113 million) trade agreements during a visit by the Tunisian prime minister to France, as activists renewed criticism of the North African country's human rights record. President Jacques Chirac, after meeting with Tunisian Premier Mohamed Ghannouchi, confirmed French support for Tunisia's economic reforms and for progress "in the domain of human rights and the rule of law". Relations between Tunisia and France have been strained over a French law last year that cited the "positive role" of colonialism, and over a law introduced Tuesday that would make it much harder to obtain residency in France. Ghannouchi did not criticize the immigration law directly, but urged a "concerted policy taking into account the interests of all parties." There are yearly visits and meetings between officials of the two countries from the highest levels of presidents and ministers to lower levels of the governments. Cooperation is extended too all fields from military and economic to cultural and scientific. Accords and agreements are always signed and renewed between the two countries. They also align their foreign policy stances with each other and coordinate their actions in the international arena very closely. France is Tunisia's main ally, main trading partner (both for imports and exports) and a large number of Tunisians have relatives living in France.
