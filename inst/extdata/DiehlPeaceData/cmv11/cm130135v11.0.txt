TERRMID: MID1145 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1145 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1145 from MID-B data, this MID has date range 12/1901-1/29/1905. From Schultz MID data, this MID describes a series of Ecuadorian protests about Peruvian advances into their territory. They protested Peruvian presence in Aguarico in 1901 (and later tried to force them out with military force), in Curaray in 1903, and in Andoas and near the Napo in 1904. Meanwhile, the two armies clashed in Angoteros in 1903, and Torres Causana in 1904. Coded territorial MID because this was directly tied to the border dispute.

TERRMID-CER: MID1147 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1147 from Schultz MID data, in the first week of April 1910, news that the Spanish King would rule in favor of Peru led to demonstrations in Ecuador. There were assaults both on the Peruvian citizens at Guayaquil and on the Peruvian legation in Quito, while the police looked on. Large street demonstrations were held in both countries as war preparations began. Later that summer, Ecuador protested Peru’s concentration of armed forces in their frontier provinces as a threat to peaceful resolution of the border conflict. Coded territorial MID because this was directly tied to the disputed border.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1151 from Schultz data, on October 8 1932, Ecuadorian troops and revenue agents entered the disputed Pocitos zone to enforce tobacco laws.

TERRMID: MID2051 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID2051 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2051 Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016) dispute the validity of this MID, claiming that Ecuador never threatened Peru and this MID should therefore be deleted. From GLM, Ecuador told the US State Dept that it would go to war to protect its property in the Amazon, but this was not directed to any specific country. Coded not territory because this was not a threat to a specific country, and thus cannot be a threat specifically over the disputed territory with Peru. Coded uncertain because GLM recommend that this be dropped.

TERRMID: MID1152 1 -- territorial MID 
TERRMID-CER: MID1152 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1152 from Schultz data, in 1934, Ecuador protested military violations of the status quo by Peruvian trail-building and Air-force flights in the Lagartococha area. In April 1935, Ecuador also protested that a Peruvian customhouse at Pantoja would infringe upon Ecuadorian commerce on the upper Napo. Peru rejected the protests and in turn denounced Ecuadorian concessions to a French firm for colonization in the Napo-Pastaza zone. In October 1935, the Zarumilla frontier erupted once again, with charges and countercharges from both sides. Both Peru and Ecuador accused each other of police infringements in Pocitos and of obstructing road traffic. Coded territorial MID because this series of incidents was tied to the disputed border.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID2124 from Schultz data, after an agreement to resolve the border was signed in 1942, continued protests by Ecuador that Peru had not vacated the disputed region. Peru did not respond, and a short while later Ecuador renewed its protest. Coded territorial MID because although a border delimitation agreement had been signed, this was still tied to the disputed region, and per the cm narrative, the agreement failed to actually settle the region.

ISLMID-CER: MID2124 1 -- certain
ISLMID-NOTES: MID2124 the disputed region contained several small islands as well.

Peru also alleged that Ecuadorian bandits had killed two of their troops. Ecuador assured Peru, the US, and others concerned that the troops had been removed. Although a border treaty was signed in 1942 and guaranteed by the US, ARG, BRA, and CHL, border concerns still festered. Coded territorial MID because this MID was triggered by troops in the disputed border region.

In the 19th century when the Spanish Empire broke up, countries in the region inherited borders based on vague or contradictory Spanish colonial maps. Peru and Ecuador fought a 10-day engagement over one such border in 1941, leading to a decisive Peruvian victory. The agreement that followed (the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol) awarded Peru 70,000 square miles of Amazon jungle. In 1960, Ecuador renounced the treaty, focusing on a renewed claim to the Cordillera del Condor area -- a small area that is believed to be rich in oil and mineral reserves, and that would give Ecuador an access to Amazon basin. In early 1995 tensions rose on the border. On January 5, Ecuadorean Defense Minister Gallardo denied reports of clashes. Large-scale fighting soon broke out, though, following clashes between Peruvian and Ecuadorean patrols from January 9-11. These clashes soon escalated, and both sides mobilized and deployed large numbers of troops to the border area. Between January 26th and March 2nd, continual clashes involved Peruvian and Ecuadorean planes, helicopters and ground troops erupted. Several ceasefires in late January and February led to temporary reductions in the fighting, but each was soon followed by renewed combat, On February 24, the OAS warned both sides to stop hostilities. Another cease-fire, the Itamaraty Declaration, was signed in Uruguay on March 1st. The agreement called for the withdrawal of troops and the placement of observers from guarantor countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States). Guarantor countries asked for guarantees on ceasefire before placing their observers. On March 6, Peru started withdrawing its troops from the disputed area. Despite the ceasefire, additional incidents continued to occur throughout March. On April 26, Ecuador pulled out last 160 troops it had in the disputed area, and on July 25 the two sides agreed to demilitarize more than 200 square miles; only 50 lightly armed soldiers from each side would remain in the disputed area (although this agreement did not settle the border issue itself). First day of dispute was on 1/9/1995 and last day of dispute was on 5/9/1995.

After fighting over a 45-mile stretch of their border in January and February of 1995, Peru and Ecuador experienced rising tensions in the same area later that year. Following the ceasefire both sides withdrew from the disputed area and created a demilitarized zone. Ecuador subsequently claimed that Peru and Ecuador had engaged in isolated incidents at the disputed region on September 20 and 21. Peru initially denied that the incidents took place, but later confirmed the incidents and claimed Peruvian troops "took initiatives not approved by their superiors." Both sides agreed in October to hold talks in January, but new incidents broke out before the talks could begin. On December 27, Peru claimed that Ecuadorean forces opened fire on its soldiers and violated its airspace. Peru placed its troops on immediate alert, cancelled New Year's leave for troops along the border, and airlifted troops and supplies to the border zone. In early January, Peru claimed that an Ecuadorean aircraft violated its airspace and that Ecuadorean soldiers opened fire on a Peruvian post in the demilitarized zone. It was also then reported that Peru was massing troops along the border and Ecuador was erecting barricades. Talks began on January 16, 1996. On March 1 and March 4, both countries signed a memorandum of understanding to promote "mutual confidence." Occasional incidents continued, though. On March 12, 1996, Peru claimed that an Ecuadorean airplane violated Peruvian airspace. On July 19, Ecuador began military exercises codenamed "Soberania" (sovereignty) in provinces neighboring Peru; Peru protested these exercises as a violation of the peace accord. By October 29, 1996, a procedural agreement for border talks was reached, although by the end of the year both sides had purchased advanced warplanes and tensions remained high. First day of dispute was on 9/20/1995 and last day of dispute was on 7/00/1996.

Two years after their near-war in the Cordillera del Condor region, tensions rose again between Peru and Ecuador before any permanent agreement was reached. On May 13, 1997, Peruvian soldiers captured seven Ecuadorean soldiers. Peru claimed the soldiers had been planting mines four miles inside Peruvian territory. Ecuador, on the other hand, claimed that the soldiers had been deactivating mines on their side of the border when Peruvian soldiers entered Ecuador and kidnapped them. The seven soldiers were returned to Ecuador through the MOMEP international peacekeeping monitors on May 15. A month later, Ecuador claimed that a Peruvian helicopter violated Ecuadorean airspace on June 9, 1997. The border violation was photographed by Ecuadorean soldiers near Vega military base. Peru denied the accusations and claimed that its airspace had been violated by Ecuadorian aircraft 35 times, although there was no proof supporting these accusations. Between September 1-6 Peru held large-scale air, land, and naval exercises near the disputed border area. These exercises were described as "routine." On October 19, according to Peruvian officials, two mortar grenades were launched from Ecuador against Peru's Vencedores Guard Post; the first grenade was an illumination shell to help aim the second. Ecuadorian officials denied the incident took place. In order to avoid a major crisis, Peru and Ecuador sped up their negotiations to reach a permanent solution. Officials met in Brasilia from November 24-28. By January 19, 1998, a working timetable was agreed on. However, the May 30 deadline for signing a final agreement was delayed. First day of dispute was on 5/13/1997 and last day of dispute was on 10/19/1997.

After their short but bloody 1995 conflict in the Cordillera del Condor region, tensions continued to rise periodically between Ecuador and Peru. In late July, Peru charged, Ecuadorean troops had occupied a disputed portion of territory 11 kilometers long and 22.8 kilometers deep. Ecuador denied the allegations, but Peru refused to negotiate until the Ecuadorean troops pulled out. There were no clashes reported. Fujimori called off his trip to Colombia following Ecuador's infiltration. On July 28, 1998, two Peruvian soldiers were injured after stepping on land mines near the disputed border. While Peru accused Ecuador for planting them, Ecuador claimed Peru was building up troops in the region. On August 1, 1998, Peru deployed heavily armed army contingents from Chachapoyas to El Milagro Base. In July, they had deployed troops from San Ignacio Base and Chachapoyas to El Milagro. Peru also prevented fishing boats in Tumbes from sailing off. Ecuador did not mobilize in response, but "strengthened its mechanisms" and asked MOMEP (the Ecuador-Peru Military Observers' Mission) to expand its area of vigilance. Peru claimed that the movements were parts of "strictly preventive actions and military maneuvers" and rejected the protest by Ecuador Defense Minister on August 4. According to the media Peru was dissatisfied by the Ecuador's lack of determination to sign a definitive peace treaty. As a result of an August 13 agreement MOMEP expanded its surveillance over the entire region. 16 Ecuadorian and 27 Peruvian bases erected during the 1995 fighting started being dismantled. Early in September, both militaries started to withdraw from the disputed region. After another Ecuadorian mine killed a Peruvian officer and injured another, Ecuador submitted a map of mined border areas to MOMEP. By the end of September 1998, two countries approved a draft trade and navigation treaty. The peace treaty was signed on October 26, in Brasilia. It gave a one square-kilometer of Peruvian territory, Tiwinza, in the middle of the jungle and another 34 kilometers on the border to Ecuador. In return, Peru received a 75 kilometer stretch of the border region. The border marking ceremony took place on January 19, 1999. First day of dispute was on 7/00/1998 and last day of dispute was on 8/13/1998.


RIVNOTES: The disputes in all three of these rivalries involve similar issues, but the rivalries are kept separate because there are significant dispute free time periods following agreements between the two states. Thus, the situation is better understood as rivalries that ended, but were reignited rather than one continuing rivalry.


NARRATIVE-CM:
Ecuador and Peru disputed the Cordillera del Condor border region (Maynas, Tumbes, and Jaen provinces) following Ecuador's independence from Spain in 1830. Ecuador and Peru signed the Espinosa-Bonifaz Treaty in Quito on August 1, 1887, providing for the submission of the border dispute to the King of Spain for arbitration. Queen Regent Maria Cristina of Spain accepted the arbitration request on behalf of King Alfonso XIII on December 12, 1887. Ecuadoran troops attacked the Peruvian garrison near Torres Causano on July 28, 1904, but the Ecuadoran troops were defeated. Some 20 Ecuadoran soldiers were killed in the attack. The countries agreed on January 29, 1905 to withdraw their troops from the disputed region. Following attacks against Peruvian properties in Quito and a mobilization of some 20,000 Ecuadoran troops on April 11, 1910, the United States, Argentina, and Brazil offered to mediate a cessation of the crisis on May 22, 1910. Peru accepted the mediation offer on May 23, 1910, and Ecuador accepted mediation offer on May 24, 1910. The US appealed for a troops withdrawal on June 1, 1910, and the countries withdrew their troops from the border region on June 4, 1910. Spain decided to discontinue the arbitration process on November 24, 1910 after Ecuador had indicated that it would not accept an arbitration award which favored Peru. Argentina, Brazil, and the US proposed that the dispute be submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). Peru accepted the proposal on January 2, 1911, but Ecuador rejected the proposal on January 16, 1911. Argentina, Brazil, and the US continued mediation through August 10, 1913 when negotiations concluded unsuccessfully. Ecuador and Peru signed a protocol in Quito on June 21, 1924, which provided for the submission of the border dispute to arbitration. Ecuadoran and Peruvian border patrols clashed near Huaquillas on October 10, 1932. Ecuadoran troops entered Tumbes province in Peru on November 1, 1935, and Peru protested the incursion on November 2, 1935. Peru deployed additional troops in the province on November 14, 1935.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The border dispute between Ecuador and Peru defines the rivalry between them and has been in existence since the early 1800s. Both countries claim an area of 125,000 square miles surrounding the Amazon and Maranon rivers called the Cordillera del Condor. The first militarized dispute in 1858, MID1593, resulted from a Peruvian blockade of Ecuador after Ecuador sold part of the disputed territory to Great Britain in order to pay off debts. The signature of the Mapasingue Convention annuled the sale of the property, temporarily calming the dispute.

From 1891 to 1955, the countries were parties to 21 militarized disputes involving the territory along their border, despite the signing of the Rio Protocol in 1942 that officially established the border between the two countries. In 1960, Ecuador renounced the Rio Protocol, causing a return to border skirmishes and incursions beginning in 1977. These border skirmishes and incursions have continued through to the current day with the last one taking place in 1998, MID4189.

Despite the numerous militarized disputes, the two countries have made efforts to peacefully resolve their differences. On March 1, 1995 the two sides signed a cease-fire agreement with the assistance of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States. This cease-fire led to a demobilization of the disputed region. In February 1998, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the US mediated peace negotiations between Ecuador and Peru, leading to the signature of a proposal by both countries on October 26, 1998, despite the last border incursion by Ecuador in August 1998, MID4189. In January 1999, Ecuador and Peru began demarcating their disputed border. 

Since the border incursion in 1998, there have been no further incidents involving militarized conflict between Ecuador and Peru. It has been reported, however, that the Peruvian public has not been particularly supportive of the treaty. Efforts to diffuse the discontent have focused on plans to develop forested areas of the country around the border by offereing tax benefits to agribusiness, commerce, telecommunication, construction, fishing and tourist industries. 

It should also be noted that in addition to the demilitarization of the border, both countries have been involved in significant domestic turmoil. Ecuador underwent a change to dollarization of its economy after suffering from severe economic problems in addition to a change in government brought about by a military coup. Peru has also been challenged with a change of governments resulting from a coup of the Fujimori regime. 

In conclusion, it does appear as if the 1998 treaty has laid the foundation for the end of the rivalry between the two countries. With continuing domestic turmoil on both sides and lack of support by Peruvians for the treaty, there does seem to be a possibility that the rivalry could continue with either side renouncing the treaty. Certainly this rivalry must be categorized as a long, censored one.

Jose Chiriboga of Ecuador accused Peru of intending to renew military hostilities during a meeting of the OAS Council on November 3, 1955, but Juan Bautista de Lavalle of Peru denied the accusation. In 1957 Peru conditioned the renewal of the discussions with Ecuador to the acceptance by Ecuador to reactivate the Mixed Commission for the Border Demarcation. President Jose Velasco Ibarra of Ecuador formally declared the 1942 Rio Protocol null and void on September 1, 1960. The four guarantor countries declared Ecuador's repudiation of the protocol invalid on December 8, 1960. The 1960s was a decade of diplomatic incidents between the two countries. From 1961 to 1967 the relations between the two countries remained tense. In August 1967, President Ibarra of Ecuador changed his opinion about the border dispute and asked Peru for a port on the Amazon River. In 1971 the Permanent Peruvian-Ecuadorian Economic Commission was set up. A number of working groups on trade were developed. A number of treaties were signed such as a treaty on the transit of people on vehicles in the border areas (1971), treaty on custom taxes (1972), treaty on telecommunications (1973), treaty on energetic and mining cooperation (1973). In 1977, the Permanent Peruvian-Ecuadorian Economic Commission held its fourth conference. At this conference the two countries discussed ways to develop closer economic and technical ties between them, especially the program for economic development and trade and technical cooperation in the border regions of Peru's Piura and Tumbes provinces and Ecuador's El Oro and Loja provinces. Overall however, the period continued to be tense due to Ecuador's rejection of the 1942 Rio Protocol and thus rejection of the border settlement.

President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and President Alberto Fujimori of Peru signed a peace agreement in Brasilia, Brazil on October 26, 1998. The ruling announced in mid-October by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the president of Brazil, demarcated a clear and fixed border, which places the Cordillera del Condor (the scene of the 1995 clashes) in Peruvian territory, while according Ecuador perpetual (but not sovereign) ownership of Tiwintza-a sensitive area covering 1 sq km on the Peruvian side of the border. The agreement also granted Ecuador unlimited and perpetual (but not sovereign) navigation rights on the Amazon River. Some additional minor components of the peace treaty (on subjects such as trade and commercial integration) have still to be ratified by both the Ecuadorian and the Peruvian legislatures. Although in Ecuador this process may be subject to delay as marginal political groups play the nationalist card for electoral advantage, there is no threat to the permanence of the overall agreement. Although the guarantors' ruling is seen by most Ecuadorians to be generally in favor of Peru, Mr Mahuad's diplomacy has enjoyed the full support of the electorate. With memories of the economic hardship that followed the 1995 clashes still fresh, there is a general desire among the population to be rid of the threat of war. Most importantly, the military has pledged its support for the commitments entered into by the government. As well as affording the population greater security and allowing for a reduction of defense expenditure, the peace treaty between Ecuador and Peru will encourage greater economic integration between the two countries. In anticipation of this, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Corporacion Andina de Fomento have each pledged $500m for the improvement of infrastructure, environmental protection and investment incentives in the border area. The funds will be channeled through the newly established Binational Commission on Border Integration. Total investment in the border area is estimated to reach $3bn. The accord also lowers military funding in both nations to aid in funding development projects. And it promotes trade between the two nations by getting rid of their geopolitical strife. The peace treaty includes bilateral customs and duties lowering which will hasten and deepen the steps toward integration which the Andean Community set up. The gradual elimination of all customs and duties by 2005 is predicted. 

In May 1999 the setting of boundary points along the 50-mile border strip ended a dispute that for more than 50 years sparked periodic skirmishes between the two countries. With this occasion, President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador said that "if we analyze the history of Ecuador and Peru, we can see that we never had problems in places where the border was defined, which means that now...we are sure that we will never again have conflicts." Peruvian and Ecuadorian voters initially approved the peace deal, however, there were several violent street demonstrations against the treaty and rumblings of discontent from within the two countries' militaries. Opposition parties in Peru warned that they would attempt to revoke the peace agreement after Fujimori's term ended in 2000. The Peruvian opposition as well as the population of the border region with Ecuador do not accept the Accord on Free Trade and Navigation, which grants Ecuadorian vessels the right to navigate the Amazon River running through Peru, and entails the construction of two duty-free Ecuadorian trading centers in the Peruvian river ports of Sarimiriza and Pebas. Those opposed to the peace treaty argue that Ecuador will take advantage of the creation of the trading centers and the right to navigation in its efforts to gain economic dominance over Peru's Amazon region. But the business sectors in both countries have noted their support of the integration process. MOMEP military observers were withdrawn from the region on June 18, 1999. In August 1999, the Presidents of Ecuador and Peru announced an assortment of joint projects, including the extension of parks, construction of river port installations, bridges, roads, forestry projects, schools and clinics that will total up to $3 billion over several years. They also signed a free-trade agreement that will remove tariffs from 585 agricultural, consumer and industrial goods. The first shipment of oil from Ecuador's Amazon jungle to the Pacific coast in Peru in August 2001, marked the beginning of energy integration between the two countries, a process that will ultimately include Colombia and Brazil. Peru is suffering a serious petroleum deficit, but produces enough electricity to meet internal demand and to develop interconnections with Ecuador, Colombia, and possibly Brazil. 

In 2001, Ecuadorean officials estimate that bilateral trade has doubled, to more than US$200m since signing a peace treaty with Peru in October 1998. Four and a half years after the countries signed a long-standing border dispute, the presidents of Peru and Ecuador inaugurated a bridge connecting the two nations. "It is a sign that the war, the conflict is a page that has been turned," Peru's President Alejandro Toledo said of the bridge. 

In March 2004, the Ecuadorian foreign minister explained that there are no border tensions between Ecuador and Peru, because such problems were "resolved" following the signing of the Peace Agreement in 1998. Technical studies for highway projects for the Ecuador-Peru binational frontier development plan will be completed in fall 2004. The plan covers five important highways that will be completed in 2005-6. Completion of the highway projects will allow trade and tourism development with Peru and Brazil and the development of the livestock sector, while the routes known as axes 4 and 5 will facilitate further investment in Ecuador's mining sector. 

In September 2005, Ecuadorian Minister for Energy, Ivan Rodriguez, signed an agreement with a Peruvian company based in Houston, BPZ Energy, to allow Ecuadorian electricity companies to purchase natural gas from Peru once the construction of a 150-mile gas pipeline and infrastructure is finished. The project is estimated to cost close to US$250m and will include a pipeline that will go from Peru to the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil, the perforation of 20 wells and the construction of an electricity generating plant with capacity of 100 mw in the north of Peru. 

On December 10th, 2006, Ecuador's President-elect Rafael Correa, speaking to reporters at the presidential palace where he met with Peruvian President Garcia, said his country's relations with Peru were at their best ever. The 1995 border war between the Ecuador and Peru over their Amazon boundary appeared a fading memory. Ecuadorian-Peruvian relations were at their best moment in history, but we still have a lot to do. Correa, who won Ecuador's presidency in a runoff Nov. 26, said Peru and Ecuador must work to mend wounds caused by the long-running border dispute, which was ended with an October 1998 treaty.
