CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1804 from NYT 12/3/1965, UK sent war planes to Zambia in response to an impending threat of force between Zambia and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Rhodesia had recently declared independence from UK, which the UK contested. A civil war was underway in Rhodesia at the time, and per the NYT 11/12/1965 and 12/3/1965, Zambia had declared emergency rule to prepare to fight rebels spilling over the border from Rhodesia. The UK planes in Zambia preparing to strike Rhodesian rebel forces trigger this MID. Coded civil war MID because the civil war in Rhodesia contributed to the events of this MID.
