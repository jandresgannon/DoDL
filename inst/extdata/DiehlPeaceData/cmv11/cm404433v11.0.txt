NARRATIVE-CM:
Guinea-Bissau and Senegal disputed their maritime border following the independence of Guinea-Bissau on September 10, 1974. On March 12, 1985, the countries agreed to submit the dispute to a three-member arbitration tribunal (Algeria, Argentina, France) headed by the representative from Argentina in Geneva, Switzerland. The arbitration tribunal issued an award in favor of Senegal on July 31, 1989. Guinea-Bissau rejected the decision on August 3, 1989, and referred the dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on August 23, 1989. On November 12, 1991, the ICJ ruled that the 1989 arbitration decision was valid and binding. The countries signed an agreement on October 14, 1993 in Dakar, Senegal that formally ended the maritime border dispute. Senegalese military aircraft bombed *Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance* (MFDC) rebel targets in Guinea-Bissau on February 10, 1995.
