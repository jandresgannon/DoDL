NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Spain and Iran takes place within the context of the Iran-Iraq War. The three mids that occur between the two countries are all bilateral disputes that are relatively minor. They are all one day disputes and were intended to put pressure on Iraq. Iraq was being funded for the conflict with Iran by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and several of the Gulf States. To put pressure on this funding and thus indirectly on Iraq, Iran targeted oil assets of the funding countries and Iraq itself. Spain got caught up in this conflict as it shipped oil out of the Persian Gulf from a number of these countries. Thus, the rivalry does not have the direct flavor of the rivalry between Iran and Iraq of course, however, Iran does target and damage or destroy three Spanish ships in a four year period. 

MID3034 occurred in December of 1984. Iranian warplanes attacked Spanish oil tankers , the Aragon on 12/26/1984. The attack set the vessel afire. This attack occurred within the tanker war in which Iran attacked Persian Gulf shipping. MID2822 and MID2765 were also Iranian attacks on Spanish oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. MID2822 occurred on 9/1/1987 and MID2765 occurred on 3/21/1988. 

The end of the rivalry coincides with and is a direct result of the end of the Iran-Iraq War. With the end of the war the incentives for both countries to strike oil assets of the opponent or supports of the opponent ended. Thus the tanker warfare against all countries transiting oil in an out of the Persian Gulf ended.
