TERRMID: MID109 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID109 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID109 from Gibler (2018), Austria-Hungary and Italy's relations were tense over the issue of Albania; each wanted Albania as a possession, especially for its valuable ports. Austrian troops were deployed to the border when tensions over Albania rose, triggering this MID, but conflict never escalated. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the parties' dispute over Albania.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID109 from Gibler (2018), the dispute over Albania included a dispute over its ports to the Adriatic Sea, but there is no indication that Italy and Austria-Hungary disputed socvereignty over the sea. Each wanted access and dominance in the Adriatic but did not apparently claim a maritime border there.

TERRLINK-CER: MID314 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID314 from Gibler (2018), this dispute between Austria-Hungary and Italy is connected to the Italo-Turkish War, a territorial war between Italy and Turkey. Austria gave Italy a stern warning about allowing that conflict to expand into the Balkans. Later, Italian warships attempted to coerce Austria into releasing Turkish warships in its harbors who were being protected. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Turkey and Italy.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Despite the *Triple Alliance* with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy declared its neutrality in the *First World War *on August 3, 1914. On November 3, 1914, Italy demanded territorial concessions (Trentino region) from Austria-Hungary in order to maintain its neutrality in the war. Baron Leopold von Berchtold, the foreign minister of Austrai-Hungary, refused the Italian demands. Germany mediated negotiations between the countries between December 20, 1914 and May 10, 1915. Austria-Hungary agreed to the cession of the Trentino region to Italy on March 9, 1915, but Italy then demanded the cession of the South Tyrol, Gorizia district, Gradisca district, and the Trieste region. Italy denounced the Triple Alliance on May 3, 1915, and declared war against Austria-Hungary on May 23, 1915. Some 200,000 Italian troops commanded by General Luigi Cadorna launched five successive military offensives against Austrian-Hungarian troops in the Isonzo region in northeastern Italy on June 23-July 7, 1915, July 18-August 3, 1915, October 18-November 4, 1915, November 10-December 2, 1915, and March 9-17, 1916. Austrian-Hungarian troops defeated the five Italian military offensives, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 176,000 Italian soldiers and 130,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers. Some 350,000 Austrian-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshall Conrad von Hotzendorf launched a military offensive against Italian troops in the Trentino region on May 15-June 17, 1916, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 107,000 Italian soldiers and 55,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers. Italian troops commanded by General Cardona launched four military offensives against Austrian-Hungarian troops in the Isonzo region between August 6 and November 4, 1916, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 127,000 Italian soldiers and 85,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers. Italian troops launched military offensives against Austrian-Hungarian troops in the Isonzo region on May 12-June 8, 1917 and August 18-September 15, 1917, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 164,000 Italian soldiers and 108,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers. *Central Powers* troops, including Austrian-Hungarian troops, defeated Italian troops in the battle of Caporetto in the Isonzo region on October 24-November 12, 1917, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 40,000 Italian soldiers and 20,000 Central Powers soldiers. Britain and France deployed troops in support of Italy in the Isonzo region in November 1917, and *Allied Powers* troops defeated Central Powers troops near the Piave River on December 11-15, 1917. Central Powers troops launched a military offensive against Allied Powers troops near the Piave River on June 15-23, 1918, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 106,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers and 40,000 Italian soldiers. The United States deploy troops in support of Italy in July 1918. Allied Powers troops launched a military offensive against Central Powers troops near Vittorio-Veneto on October 24-November 4, 1918, resulting in the deaths or wounding of some 30,000 Italian soldiers and 3,000 Allied soldiers. Italian troops captured Trieste on November 3, 1918 and Fiume on November 5, 1918. Austria-Hungaria and the Allied Powers agreed to a cessation of military hostilities on November 3, 1918. Austrian and Italian representatives signed the *Treaty of St. Germain* on September 10, 1919, which provided for the Austrian cession of South Tyrol (Bolzano province), Trentino region, Trieste region, and Istria to Italy. Some 420,000 Italian soldiers died as a result of combat and disease on the Austrian-Hungarian front during the war.

NARRATIVE-CR:
In the revolutions that occurred in Naples in 1820 and in Piedmont in 1821 (MID167), the demand was primarily for constitutional government. A liberal group called the Carbonari which arose during the Napoleonic wars was struggling for a constitution. In both cases, Austria stepped in to restore order by force, setting the stage for the Italian uprisings that would follow 30 and 40 years later (Clodfelter 1992). The revolutions of 1848 were a replay of the uprisings in the 1820's. In the cities of Milan and Venice, the native Italians rose up against the Austrian rules and on March 26th of 1848 (MID19) the Venetians declared themselves a separate republic (Clodfelter 1992). By May of 1849 the Austrian's had begun to respond in force and by late July the independent republics which had sprung up in Italy were destroyed. The Austrians had regained control over Italy for another decade, however not without repeated revolts. one such revolt occurred in 1853 in Milan, where another attempt at independence occurred (MID3326). It would not be until the War of Italian Unification (MID115) that Austria-Hungary would be ousted from control of Italy. In the summer of 1859 a second revolt occurred with the aid of the French Forces under Napoleon III. French support enabled the Italian forces to overrun the Austrian rulers by 1861. With the defeat of the Austrian-Hungarian (backed by Germany) forces Emmanuel II was declared King of a unified Italy on May 17th of 1861 (Clodfelter 1992). 

Hostilities resumed with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 (MID261). Bismark, having defeated Denmark in 1864, was again pushing for German unification. He turned his Prussian army against Austria in 1866. Italy committed forces to aid Bismark agaist their long-time enemies. Two major battles were fought by Italy against Austria-Hungary on June 24th and July 20th of 1866 (Clodfelter 1992). Austria was soundly defeated and was forced to sign an armistice on July 26th (Clodfelter 1992). Austria was forced to give up any and all claims to Germany or Central Europe. The next dispute (MID1635) seems related to the previous issues and may have had to do with the German alliance with Russia and Austria against France that was formed in June of 1877. 

There is no record of a dispute occurring between Italy and Austria in September of 1904 (MID109), and therefore it could not have been largely significant nor strongly related to the important rivalry issues. The First World War (MID257) provided the venue for the dispute between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war alongside the allies (MID320) in October of 1914. With the defeat of Germany in 1918 came a negotiated Armistice on November 11th. Germany had to clear Belgium, France and Alsace-Loraine of all forces, surrender its military hardware, evacuate the Rhine region, surrender much of its rail system, endure Allied occupation troops and surrender its navy (Grenville 1980). Following the Armistice the Treaty of Versailles was negotiated which specified German reparations to the Allied Powers mostly France. Versailles (June 18th, 1919) upheld the conditions of the Armistice as well as specifying the conditions under which the Austrian-Hungarian Empire would be dismantled. Versailles effectively ended the Empire and therefore all rivalry issues were also settled.

SB-CR:
Austria-Hungary (Austria) / Italy Years: 1843-1919. Issues at stake: Austrian/Italian border, especially in areas of South Tyrol, the Brenner pass, and Fiume; Austro-Hungarian opposition to growing Italian influence in the balkans as the Ottoman Empire declines. End coding: The Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, signed on September 10, 1919, settled the border between Italy and Austria. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 10. Last militarized dispute: 1918 (WWI). Wars: 1848, 1859, 1866, 1915-1918. Summary: The roots of the Austro-Italian rivalry develop with the growing nationalism on the part of Italians for the unification of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (the southern half of what is now Italy) with the Papal states and the various northern- Italian kingdoms and duchies. Austria did not want a unified Italy on its southern flank, which would fundamentally alter the balance of power in Europe (Albrecht-Carrie 1958:96). Early disputes were over Austrian intervention in Sardinia and Lombardy which spread to war in 1848. After Italian unification after war between Austria-Hungary on one side and Italy and France on the other in 1859, disputes shifted to issues of control over strategic border areas such as the Brenner pass, along with Great Power politics that allied Italy with Prussia. WWI settled issues of influence in the Balkans, eliminating the Austro-Hungarian "empire," and the WWI peace settlement with Austria set borders between Italy and Austria that have not been militarily challenged since. Notes: After the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Austria inherited the disagreement with Italy over territory. Hungary was cut off from those areas by the creation of Yugoslavia. The COW dispute data set includes 2 later disputes (1926 and 1929) between Italy and Austria. Both of these involve no militarized response by the target. I have been able to find no reference to these minor disputes in the diplomatic histories (Albrecht-Carrie 1958, Mowat 1927), but they apparently do not represent new claims on the border settlement.
