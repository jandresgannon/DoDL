TERRMID-NOTES: MID1163 from cm narrative, In 1902, Brazil invaded the area of Acre, a piece of territory that was already being disputed by Bolivia and Peru, beginning a Brazilian claim to the territory.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Peru and Brazil experienced three isolated disputes in the 20th century. All three disputes involved separate issues and do not constitute a rivalry. A brief description of the disputes follows below.

On October 27, 1902 Brazil invaded the territory of Acre, claimed by both Boliva and Peru, MID1163. In December 1902, Brazil began negotiations with Bolivia over the disputed territory of Acre. Peru also claimed this territory and protested against any bilateral negotiations between Brazil and Bolivia. In 1903 Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of Petropolis which ceded the territory to Brazil despite protests from Peru. In 1904, Brazil and Peru signed a treaty to end the conflict. Continued negotiations over the territory led to a treaty defining the boundaries on September 8, 1909 with the principle of uti possidetis determining Brazilian ownership of Acre.

In August 1918, Peruvian troops mutinied, causing a small rebellion. Members of the rebellion crossed into Brazilian territory, MID1164. 

From September 1932 to May 1933, Peruvian troops passed through Brazilian territory in order to fight Colombia in the dispute over the port of Leticia, MID2050.
