TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler 2018, Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente (Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia), but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because Yugoslavia and Romania were not disputing territory here (the earlier issue over Carinthia was resolved at this point). Coded uncertain because it is unclear why Romania and Yugoslavia are on opposite sides of this MID, as both are members of the Little Entente.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, this is a multilateral MID pitting US and Yugoslavia against USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the first few years of the Cold War. The tensions that led to this MID began when Yugoslavia and the USSR began to drift apart in terms of the ruling Yugoslavia Communist Party's willingness to acquiesce to Stalin's directives. The US observed the drift and tried to create an anti-Soviet state in the region by providing economic, food, and military assistance to Yugoslavia, and even attempted to bring Yugoslavia into NATO. Soviet troop mobilizations and border clashes occurred between Yugoslavia and Soviet-bloc states Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. Coded not territory because Yugoslavia and Romania did not dispute any territory between them. This was connected to Cold War tensions.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, Stalin attempted to create domestic unrest that would result in an overthrow of the communist government in Yugoslavia and the replacement by a more USSR-friendly communist government. However, the domestic unrest did not result in violence or a militarized rebel group during this MID. Coded not civil war because no militarized anti-government group was present.

TERRMID-CER: MID1703 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1703 from Gibler 2018, this is a Cold War MID that began when Yugoslavia began to pull away from Stalinist Communism in Europe. The Yugoslavian leader, Marshall Tito, began enacting and arguing for policies in the interest of Yugoslavia rather than the Socialist Union as a whole. In 1952, Yugoslavia fortified its border with Hungary fearing an attack, protested that Soviet airplanes violated its airspace, and accused Bulgaria of espionage. Romania accused Yugoslavia of violating their airspace, while Hungary protested that Yugoslavia destroyed two bridges linking their territories. Tensions eventually died down. Coded not territory because this was connected to Cold War tensions, and Yugoslavia and Romania were not disputing territory here.

TERRLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Yugoslavia thought the Yugoslavian states should not have their own boundaries independent of a Yugoslavian state. They therefore refused to recognize the independence of states that declared independence from Yugoslavia, still claiming their territory as part of Yugoslavia. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Romania (as part of UN/NATO) became involved in this MID, which is territorial, civil war, and civil war link. See CIVWARMID and CIVWARLINK.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/independence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerrillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia, armed the villagers, and the newly armed villagers violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, Romania, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4186 from cm narrative, this is one of two MIDs connected to Yugoslavia's withdrawal from Kosovo and the lingering hostilities between Yugoslavia and UN/NATO forces. Clashes occurred as Milosevic was attempting to hold onto power in Serbia. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo was partially territorial in nature, as Yugoslavia did not recognize its independence and claimed its territory as its own due to ethnic Serbs. UN/NATO countries' military intervention in Kosovo pulls them into this MID.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4186 the Yugoslavian War involved extensive fighting between insurgent groups organized along ethnic lines, and these groups sometimes fought against states as well. Here, ethnic Albanians fought inside Serbia/Yugoslavia over Serbia's aggression toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved insurgents fighting inside Serbia/Yugoslavia against Serbian guerrillas.

In response to Yugoslav involvement in Bosnian civil war, Western countries first showed force and then began a blockade against Yugoslavia. On 7/16/1992 there was a show of force by USA, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Italy. The blockaded against Yugoslavia commences on 11/22/1992 with Belgium joining the states mentioned above. Netherlands joins the MIDdue to its assistance to the US and France by enforcing a No-Fly zone over Yugoslavia on 4/12/1339. End date is the end date of the Blockade. First day of dispute was on 1/30/1993 and last day of dispute was on 2/8/1993.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. First day of dispute was on 2/21/2000 and last day of dispute was on 4/3/2000.

RIVNOTES: 

RIV902: MID3.1 no longer considers Romania a part of MID4343. It is removed from rivalry. From mid31changes.txt:
"MID4186 NATO versus YUG (2000): discrepancies among end dates recorded for the MID and MID participation: MID A file (28- Nov-2000), MID B file (28-Nov-2000), MID I file (3-Apr-2000), MID IP file (3-Apr-2000). The inconsistency is due to the split up of MID4186 into two MIDs (MID4186 and MID4343). MID4186 consists of two MID incidents. While MID I and MID IP files were updated accordingly, adjustments regarding start and end dates were not made in MID A and MID B files. End dates changed in MID A and B files: The MID starts on 21-Feb-2000 and ends on 3-Apr-2000. RUM and TUR were not involved in MID and, thus, deleted as participants. NYT, LT Dispute Changed 3.1 Jul-06"

RIV902: MID4186, this MID has been broken up into two MID4186 & MID4343 because the incidents were more than 6 months apart in mid3.02

RIV900: MID3.02 has recoded MID1251 as Bulgaria against everyone else in the Second Balkan War (1913).

NARRATIVE-CR:
The Second Balkan War (MID1251) began between Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria (backed by Turkey) over the division of the lands won in the First Balkan War. Romanian forces in the war were small (1500) and Romania made no gains in terms or territory at the close of the war (www.onwar.com 2003). With the defeat of Bulgaria a peace treaty was signed in August of 1913. Serbia gained the Kosovo region and gained several other territories in Macedonia, Greece also gained a few new territories and the island of Crete (www.onwar.com 2003). The second dispute (MID1263) between Yugoslavia and Romania is a single day dispute for which there is no record. In September and October of 1922 conflict arose over the Romanian adoption of a new constitution (MID3181) which prohibited the ownership of land by foreigners and allowed citizenship of Jews (Clodfelter 1992). These reforms ended the ownership of land by Hungarian citizens (An ally of Yugoslavia) and resolved the source of tension following WWI. 

A new issue arose in August of 1949 with the rise of the Communist party in Yugoslavia and the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform countries, of which Romania was a member (Stavrianos 2000). Yugoslavia had a disagreement with the Cominform countries regarding the return of German property from WWII. A first agreement was signed in 1951 (MID1286), ending the first disagreement over reparations. A second dispute came about between Romania and Yugoslavia in 1953 with the drafting of a new communist constitution and the appointment of Tito in Yugoslavia (MID1703). 

The last series of disputes began in 1992 with the onset of the Bosnian civil war (MID3551). In spring of 1992 Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia all began fighting with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Serbian leaders began shelling Croats and Muslims in Sarajevo which brought on sanctions by the UN and specifically involvement of NATO. Romania, along with many in the international community placed sanctions on Serbia and condemned the human rights violations. Romania was entangled in the ethnic question raging on in the former republics of Yugoslavia and would be until the peace accord reached in December 14th of 1995 (www.onwar.com 2003). NATO troops (60,000) entered Bosnia to enforce the Dayton peace accords. The final dispute (MID4186) between the two states is related to the Yugoslavian elections in 2000. Socialist Party head, Slobodan Milosevic (the man responsible for many human rights violations in the previous war) called for early elections in an attempt to win reelection. After being defeated Milosevic claimed the election invalid. Finally, in November he admitted defeat (www.cnn.com).
