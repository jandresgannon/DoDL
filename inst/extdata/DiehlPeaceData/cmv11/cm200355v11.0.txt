Allied and Bulgarian representatives conducted peace negotiations in Istanbul and Cairo between June 20 and September 1, 1944.

NARRATIVE-CR:

Tensions rose between the United Kingdom and Bulgaria after the signing the Tripartite Pact in Vienna on March 1, 1941 (Miller 1975). Churchill commanded British foreign interest and Prime Minister Filov was in control of Bulgaria. Following Bulgaria's official alignment with Germany the number of incidents with British and Allied citizens increased. As early as February the Bulgarian police force had begun harassing the British. Specifically a consular officer suspiciously disappeared and about 50 people were arrested and charged as spies for the UK. Also, several journalists and reporters associated with the London Times and the Chicago Tribune were arrested (Miller 1975). The last MID258, which corresponds to "World War II" and the ending date is listed as September 8th, 1944. This date precedes a coup that dispelled the wartime government and repealed all laws consistent with the German fascist regime (Miller 1975). 

Germany did not expect much from the addition of Bulgaria to the Axis powers and according to the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, they did not expect to do much either (Miller 1975). The Bulgarians did not expect to actually be involved in conflict and viewed their entry into the war against the Allies as a way to please the probable future ruler of Central and Eastern Europe. However, Prime Minister Churchill did view the alignment as an act of aggression and closed the British embassy on March 1st. The Bulgarian police reportedly found a British planted bomb on the same day and broke relations with the UK and all British controlled governments in exile as well (Miller 1975).

Bulgaria had remained fairly unaffected by the war until the British led Allied bombings in the summer of 1943 (Miller 1975). Three attacks on the city of Sofia were moderately effective in the physical damage they inflicted but highly effective in creating panic and forcing the citizenry to evacuate. The air attack of January 10, 1944 was more effective and fundamentally shut down the city of Sofia. The apparent weakness and inability of Bulgaria worried the Germans and forced them to remove support and redraw their defensive lines (Miller 1975.)

By March the Allied powers had effectively destroyed Sofia and began the massive waves of starvation that Bulgaria could not ebb. Rumors grew that the Soviet forces were planning and invasion and almost any belief that Germany would defend Bulgaria had disappeared. Bulgaria expressed a desire for an armistice but it insisted that any such treaty would also require the stationing of Allied troops to prevent German reprisal (Miller 1975). However, the stationing of troops in the Balkans did not play into the Allied battle strategy. No such armistice was reached because Bulgaria feared Germany more than continued Allied attacks. 

Government change came by September 9th of 1944 once the defeat of Germany seemed imminent. On the 6th Bulgaria issued a statement to Germany that insisted the removal of all troops by the 7th. Bulgaria severed relations with Germany on the 7th and formally declared war on Germany on the 8th (Miller 1975). Filov resigned following the declaration of war rather then give his consent and Kimon Georgiev (who organized the coup) became the new Prime Minister. 

Following the coup in September an armistice with the allies was signed in October 28, 1944 (Leiss and Dennett 1954). The armistice required that Bulgaria restore all property of the UN and their nationals, including Greek and Yugoslav property and that it would pay for any damages that would be determined later (Leiss and Dennett 1954). The UK recommended that Bulgaria pay a total of $70 million in total reparations. The UK recommendation was eventually adopted and Bulgaria was ordered to repay $45 million to Greece and $25 million to Yugoslavia (Leiss and Dennett 1954). All German possessions in Bulgaria were transferred to the USSR in compliance with the Potsdam conference.

Following the reparation decisions Bulgaria was left to deal with its war criminals in its own courts. On February 2nd of 1945 Filov, General Mihov and Prince Kiril were all put to death for conspiracy with the Germans (Miller 1975). The new PM Georgiev along with his party shifted the decision making power in Bulgaria to the communist party and away from the previous nationalist faction.
