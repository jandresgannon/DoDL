TERRMID: MID1360 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1360 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1360 from the CR narrative, "Cambodian troops and troops of N. Vietnam and communist guerillas of S. Vietnam clashed in open warfare." However, Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk believed that North Vietnam was trying to draw Cambodia into the Vietnam War on the side of South Vietnam and the US, giving North Vietnam an excuse to invade Cambodia. MID1360 was a violation of Cambodian sovereignty but was not connected to a claim on territory. North Vietnam was attempting to draw Cambodia into an internationalized civil war (Vietnam War).

TERRLINK: MID1360 1 -- third party linked to territorial dispute 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1360 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1360 from CR narrative, N Vietnam provoked clashes with Cambodia with the intention of drawing Cambodia into the Vietnam War, a territorial dispute between North and South Vietnam. The Vietnam War was a territorial dispute, and per the COW War data, it was an interstate war at this time. Coded third party link to territorial dispute because N Vietnam's aggression toward Cambodia was an attmept to draw Cambodia into the Vietnam War, a territorial dispute involving a party outside of this dyad.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1360 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1360 From CR narrative, N Vietnam and Cambodian troops clashed in open warfare after N Vietnam violated the territorial sovereignty of Cambodia. N Vietnam was attempting to draw Cambodia into an internationalized civil war, the Vietnam War. N Vietnam is in this dyad.

CIVWARLINK: MID1360 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1360 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1360 coded civil war link because from Gibler 2018, this MID involved Vietnamese communists in Cambodia (prompting Cambodia to condemn them). The communist guerillas built bases in Cambodian territory and used it to fight against the South. This was therefore connected to the Vietnam civil war, and South Vietnam is outside this dyad. 

COUPMID: MID1360 1 -- coup MID 
COUPMID-CER: MID1360 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: MID1360 from Gibler 2018, this MID involves a coup occurring in Cambodia in 1970. Prince Sihanouk was deposed and fled into exile to form an opposition group that would later fight the new government. Coded coup MID because this was connected to a coup in Cambodia, within this dyad.

MID611

TERRMID: MID611 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID611 is the Vietnam War. From CR narrative, at the time of this MID and over its entire duration, there was not a territorial dispute between Cambodia and N Vietnam. Cambodia's involvement in this multilateral MID begins when General Nol takes power in Cambodia and, at the US and S Vietnam's urging, begins to fight against N Vietnamese communist forces in Cambodia. Coded not territory because although N Vietnamese forces were in Cambodia, the force was not being used in a territorial claim. 

TERRLINK: MID611 1 -- third party linked to territorial dispute
TERRLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID611 from CR narrative, Cambodia entered the Vietnam War against N Vietnam and on the side of S Vietnam. Coded third party link to territory because Cambodia became a party to a territorial dispute between N Vietnam and another state outside of this dyad (S Vietnam).

CIVWARMID-CER: MID611 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID611 from CR narrative, Cambodia's entry into the Vietnam War (MID611) followed and was a direct result of the coup in 1970, which was a part of the Cambodian Civil War. MID611 also contains the Vietnam war, an internationalized civil war that Cambodia joined in MID611 by fighting N Vietnamese forces and allying with US/S Vietnam.

CIVWARLINK: MID611 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID611 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID611 coded civil war link for two reasons. First, MID611 is coded as a civil war MID in other dyads. Second, MID611 involves Cambodia's entrance into the Vietnam War, which is partly an internationalized civil war. The civil war aspect of this war involves Civil War in S Vietnam, which is outside of this dyad.

TERRMID: MID1617 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1617 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1617 is Cambodia's participation in the Vietnam war. From CR narrative, North Vietnamese troops were actively violating Cambodia's territorial sovereignty, but this was not connected to a territorial claim. Cambodia had joined the Vietnam War, an internationalized civil war, on the side of the US/S Vietnam. Coded not territory because no territorial dispute was present at that time. 

TERRLINK: MID1617 1 -- third party linked to territorial dispute 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1617 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1617 from CR narrative, Cambodia participated in the Vietnam War against N Vietnam and on the side of S Vietnam. Coded third party link to territory because Cambodia became a party to a territorial dispute between N Vietnam and another state outside of this dyad (S Vietnam).

MID1435

TERRMID: MID1435 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1435 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1435 from Thompson data, a territorial rivalry between N Vietnam and Cambodia began in 1976 (MID1435 occurs from 1975-1979). After the Vietnam War ended, the boundary between Cambodia and N Vietnam was disputed. From CR narrative, border clashes occurred and this escalated into a war in 1977. Coded territorial MID because border became disputed, border clashes and escalation to war followed. Also, Pol Pot publicly accused N Vietnam of trying to incorporate Cambodia into its territory. 

TERRLINK: MID1435 3 -- not third party linked to territorial dispute 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1435 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1435 at the time of this MID, S Vietnam, the external party to the territorial dispute (Vietnam War), no longer existed, so there was no longer an external territorial dispute for Cambodia to be involved with. This MID is associated with an unsettled border with N Vietnam. 

MARITMID: MID1435 3 -- not maritime 
MARITMID-CER: MID1435 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID1435 from Schultz data, clashes occurred on land, sea, and offshore islands, but only the land border was disputed. Coded not maritime because maritime boundary was not disputed and these clashes were a result of tensions over the land boundary. 

ISLMID: MID1435 3 -- not islands
ISLMID-CER: MID1435 1 -- certain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID1435 from Schultz data, clashes occurred on land, sea, and offshore islands, but only the land border was disputed. Coded not islands because islands were not disputed and these clashes were a result of tensions over the land boundary. 

CIVWARMID: MID1435 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1435 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1435 from CR narrative, Vietnam directly assisted in a domestic overthrow of the Cambodian government, which fell in 1979. It appears in this case that the border clashes (1975) preceded N Vietnam funding an assassination attempt against Pol Pot (1977 accusation).

TERRMID-CER: MID4004 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4004 from CR narrative, this MID is part of an ongoing rivalry fueled by a territorial dispute. (Consistent with Thompson data that codes a territorial/spatial rivalry from 1976-1983). In MID4004, Vietnamese troops invaded several Cambodian villages and turned them into defensive fortifications. Cambodia deployed several hundred troops to halt the advance. Both states claim the occupied territory.

Vietnamese troops move into six villages four to five km inside Cambodian territory, forcing the evacuation of the local population and digging fortifications. The area is the Suay Rieng province, Duong sub-district in Cambodia. Cambodia dispatches approximately 300 troops to block any further advance of Vietnamese forces. The occupied territory is claimed by both states. First day of dispute was on 1/24/1996 and last day of dispute was on 1/30/1996.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The MIDs that constitute the rivalry between Cambodia and North Vietnam revolve around different issues raising the question as to whether this is one unified rivalry. The first MID, MID1360 is about territorial sovereignty, that is N. Vietnamese violation of Cambodian sovereignty. However, the issue was complicated by the charged intent of the N. Vietnamese. Cambodia, under Prince Sihanouk, took a neutral stance in the conflicts in Indochina. He wanted to preserve the independence of Cambodia. By invading Cambodian territory, the Prince charged the N. Vietnamese of attempting to force Cambodia into the American camp. The second pair of MIDs, MID611 and MID1617 are the entry and participation of Cambodia in the Vietnam War. Here the government in Cambodia has changed. There is a coup and a staunch anti communist takes control of Cambodia. The pro US/S. Vietnam government of Cambodian General Nol staunchly supports the US in its war against N. Vietnam. In the third MID, MID1435, Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge government rules Cambodia. The united, communist Vietnam wants to influence activities in Cambodia but Pol Pot resists Vietnamese influence. Increasing border tension then escalates into full-scale war as Vietnam eventually invades and installs a puppet government. In sum the three issues have a different character and do not seem to be unified around one or two core issues. 

Territorial sovereignty/forcing the hand of Cambodia

MID1360 occurs from 3/28 to 10/16/1969. During this period, Cambodian troops and troops of N. Vietnam and communist guerillas of S. Vietnam clashed in open warfare. Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia charged the N. Vietnamese of attempting to force him into the American camp. This would then provide the pretext for full scale N. Vietnamese intervention into Cambodia to `liberate' the country. 

Support to S. Vietnam vs. N. Vietnam

MID611 and MID1617 are about the Vietnam War. In March of 1970, Cambodian General Lon Nol successfully took control of Cambodia in a coup. He changed the direction of Cambodian foreign policy towards the war in Vietnam. For years Cambodian Prince Sihanouk took a neutral stance and did not take action to forcibly remove the communist N. Vietnamese troops operating in Cambodian territory against S. Vietnam and the US. The US and S. Vietnam encouraged General Nol to take control of the country as they grew frustrated with the Prince. When the General took control he then formally joins the US and S. Vietnam in the war against N. Vietnam. His army is poorly trained and equipped as it loses most of its engagements with N. Vietnamese troops in Cambodian territory. 

Vietnamese interference in Cambodia. 

MID1435 occurs from 1975 until 1979. From May of 1975, increasing border clashes occurred between Cambodia and Vietnam. This escalated into full scale war at the end of 1977. In April of 1977, there was an attempted coup against Pol Pot with the backing of Vietnam. Pol Pot then publicly accused Vietnam of trying to incorporate Cambodia into a Vietnam dominated federation. He then broke off diplomatic relations with Vietnam. In May of 1978, an uprising against Pol Pot took place with the support of Vietnam. In December of 1978 regular Vietnamese forces assisted Cambodian rebels in a determined bid to overthrow the Pol Pot government. Phnom Penh fell to the Vietnamese on January 7, 1979. Vietnam then installed its own hand picked government. 

Should this series of disputes be deemed a rivalry, one event causes the cessation of MIDs between the countries from 1979 until 1996. In January of 1979 after the conclusion of the war between Vietnam and Cambodia, the Vietnamese installed a puppet regime. The Vietnamese maintained a military presence and the puppet regime in Cambodia until late in 1989. 

In the fall of 1989, the Bush administration of the US initiated consultations with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in an effort to establish a Cambodia settlement. This effort was designed to follow up on a decade long diplomatic effort by the UN and ASEAN to reach an agreement that all sides in the Cambodian internal conflicts would agree on. Vietnam was under increasing pressure by the collapse of its patron state, the USSR. It became increasingly isolated and pressured by the PRC to give up its ambitions to establish a hegemonic position in Indochina. Thus, Vietnam came to terms with the PRC. In the fall of 1991, a U.S. brokered UN Security Council framework agreement for a Cambodia peace process was accepted by all parties to include, the US, the PRC, Vietnam, other regional parties, and all factions of the internal Cambodian conflict. It was formally adopted in the fall of 1991. In early 1992, the first contingents of the UNTAC arrived in Phnom Penh to implement the peace plan. In a series of secret bilateral meetings between the leaders in Hanoi and Beijing that began in the fall of 1990, the Chinese induced the Vietnamese to accept the US sponsored UN peace plan for Cambodia. The UN verified the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the UNTAC restored a sense of civil government in 1992. In the spring of 1993, the UN administered a successful popular election in Cambodia. 

As this process proceeded, the US and Vietnam resumed efforts to normalize relations after the war years and Hanoi's 1978 invasion of Cambodia. The US pressed Vietnam to back the Cambodia peace plan and to account for US MIAs in Vietnam and Laos. These objectives were established in the `roadmap' to normalization with Vietnam. This roadmap was substantially fulfilled with the culmination of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995. 

In January of 1996, renewed hostilities occurred as MID4004 took place. Several minor incidents occurred between Vietnamese frontier guards and security forces from Cambodia. Reports on the incidents vary. It was reported that Cambodian border guards violated Vietnamese territory. There were also reports that 200 members of the Cambodian security forces had crossed the frontier into Vietnamese territory. Cambodians often lease land to Vietnamese from across the border, resulting in disputes over ownership. It was also reported that a number of Vietnamese police and civilians built houses and tilled lands in the areas inside Cambodia's eastern provinces. It was also claimed that the Vietnamese had occupied six villages along the border. There were reports of unprovoked firing across the border, the killing of a Cambodian policeman and several injuries in Vietnam, with the two sides trading accusations. Subsequent to the dispute, Cambodia and Vietnam agreed to seek a peaceful solution to their border dispute. Though Cambodia and Vietnam agreed to resolve their border dispute peacefully, they have not finalized a border agreement demarcating the border and resolving their dispute. They have however developed closer bilateral ties since the last MID.

19540721-19690327 0.5

Cambodia became a member of the international system on November 9, 1953. North Vietnam was established on July 21, 1954. Cambodia has always leaned closer to North Vietnam than South Vietnam during the 1950s and 1960s, harboring North Vietnamese guerillas that conducted operations from its territory against South Vietnam's regime. On March 16, 1964, Prince Sihanouk said that Cambodia will not get involved in the South Vietnam conflict, even though it will establish closer ties with North Vietnam. On June 13, 1967, Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, the Cambodian chief of state, said that Cambodia was establishing diplomatic relations with North Vietnam and exchanging ambassadors. He said that North Vietnam has recognized the current borders of Cambodia. On January 9, 1968, the Foreign Minister of Cambodia completed a visit to North Vietnam during which he met with Ho Chi Minh, the North Vietnamese leader and discussed the improvement of bilateral relations.

19790108-19920529 0.75

In January of 1979 after the conclusion of the war between Vietnam and Cambodia, the Vietnamese installed a puppet regime. The Vietnamese maintained a military presence and the puppet regime in Cambodia until late in 1989.

Vietnam sent more troops into guerrilla strongholds near the Thai-Cambodian border on June 29, 1980, the Thai military command said, in what could be the start of a major drive to crush the remnants of toppled Cambodian Premier Pol Pot's supporters. In Malaysia, U.S. Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie pledged to accelerate military aid to non-communist Thailand, whose troops traded artillery fire with Vietnamese forces in Cambodia in the sixth day of border fighting. An estimated 200,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia, where they helped topple Pol Pot in 1979 and replaced him with Heng Samrin, the current leader. Since then, the Vietnamese have supported Phnom Penh's battle against Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge and reported resistance from Free Khmer anti-communist guerrillas.

Vietnam pledged on July 7, 1982, to withdraw a ''significant number'' of troops from Cambodia as exiled Prince Norodom Sihanouk triumphantly returned to his occupied homeland to drive the Vietnamese out. ''I cannot disclose the number involved but it will be a significant withdrawal,'' Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said. ''It is a token of our good will.''

Vietnam plans to withdraw one-third of its troops from Cambodia by the end of 1985, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach has revealed on April 15, 1985. In a recent interview giving the first detailed outline of Hanoi's military plans in Cambodia, Mr. Nguyen said Vietnam's troop strength there will be halved from the present level by 1987 if no negotiated settlement is reached. In 1990, two-thirds of the troops will be back in Vietnam and by 1995 Cambodia's armed forces will defend the country alone with all Vietnamese troops withdrawn, he said. Vietnam has not announced how many troops at present are in Cambodia but Western diplomats estimate there are up to 180,000 soldiers fighting guerrilla groups, active mainly along the Cambodian-Thai border. Diplomats have dismissed Vietnam's announcements over the past years of small-scale pullouts-including the withdrawal of 10,000 troops earlier this month-as nothing more than troop rotations and propaganda ploys. Vietnamese troops moved into Cambodia in December, 1978, ousting the Khmer Rouge in January, 1979, and installing the Heng Samrin Government in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge are now linked with the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and supporters of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in a guerrilla coalition recognized by the United Nations as Cambodia's legitimate government.

On May 26, 1988, Vietnam announces it will withdraw 50,000 troops, half its forces in Cambodia, by the end of 1988. On June 30, 1988, Vietnam's military high command leaves Cambodia, officials said.

A senior military officer said on September 27, 1989, that the last Vietnamese soldiers were hauled out of Cambodia atop broken-down trucks to end Vietnam's nearly 11-year-long war in Cambodia. "Now there are absolutely no Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia," said Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry of Defense. Thai also disclosed that Vietnam will spend $$5 million to move to Vietnam the graves of Vietnamese soldiers who were buried in Cambodia. And he said two soldiers died during the six-day pullout, making them the last casualties in the conflict that has cost 55,300 Vietnamese lives.

In the fall of 1989, the Bush administration of the US initiated consultations with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in an effort to establish a Cambodia settlement. This effort was designed to follow up on a decade long diplomatic effort by the UN and ASEAN to reach an agreement that all sides in the Cambodian internal conflicts would agree on. Vietnam was under increasing pressure by the collapse of its patron state, the USSR. It became increasingly isolated and pressured by the PRC to give up its ambitions to establish a hegemonic position in Indochina. Thus, Vietnam came to terms with the PRC. In the fall of 1991, a U.S. brokered UN Security Council framework agreement for a Cambodia peace process was accepted by all parties to include, the US, the PRC, Vietnam, other regional parties, and all factions of the internal Cambodian conflict. It was formally adopted in the fall of 1991. In early 1992, the first contingents of the UNTAC arrived in Phnom Penh to implement the peace plan. In a series of secret bilateral meetings between the leaders in Hanoi and Beijing that began in the fall of 1990, the Chinese induced the Vietnamese to accept the US sponsored UN peace plan for Cambodia. The UN verified the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the UNTAC restored a sense of civil government in 1992. In the spring of 1993, the UN administered a successful popular election in Cambodia.

Vietnam, which occupied Cambodia for more than a decade, welcomed a peace accord signed by all four warring Cambodian factions, a government statement said on October 24, 1991. ''Vietnam welcomes the efforts made by all Cambodian factions,'' the statement broadcast on Hanoi Radio said. ''The signing of the accord will restore peace in Cambodia and offer an opportunity for the Cambodian people to rebuild and develop their country and build an independent, peaceful, free, democratic, neutral and socially progressive Cambodia,'' the statement said. All four Cambodian factions along with 19 other nations signed the peace agreement in Paris, in a move to end 13 years of civil war. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the brutal Khmer Rouge government and installed the government in Phnom Penh. Thousands of Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia until Hanoi announced in September 1989 it was withdrawing of all its troops. ''Vietnam hopes that in the spirit of national reconciliation and concord, the Cambodian people will overcome all difficulties and ordeals to make their country prosperous and powerful and achieve a peaceful, abundant and happy life,'' the radio said.

19920530-19981208 Transition 

On 30 May 1992, Vietnam confirmed in writing to UNTAC that its forces, volunteers and all equipment had been completely withdrawn from Cambodia by 26 September 1989 and that they had not been reintroduced. By July 1992, UN's peacekeepers under UNTAC were fully deployed in Cambodia and there were no Vietnamese troops left there. 

As this process proceeded, the US and Vietnam resumed efforts to normalize relations after the war years and Hanoi's 1978 invasion of Cambodia. The US pressed Vietnam to back the Cambodia peace plan and to account for US MIAs in Vietnam and Laos. These objectives were established in the `roadmap' to normalization with Vietnam. This roadmap was substantially fulfilled with the culmination of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.

Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh arrived in Hanoi on January 15, 1995, for talks with Vietnamese leaders on a host of sensitive topics, including the legal status of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. During a a three-day visit to Vietnam, Ranariddh is also expected to broach other important issues such as navigation rights along the Mekong River and defining the limits of the two countries' disputed land and sea borders. Ranariddh last visited Vietnam in August 1993 as head of Cambodia's then provisional government, at which time he was accompanied by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. Ranariddh is due to hold talks with Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet, who visited Phnom Penh in April 1994. Meetings with Communist Party head Do Muoi and President Le Duc Anh are also on the official agenda. Vietnam has registered strong concern over Cambodia's controversial immigration law, passed last August by the National Assembly, saying it could be used to expel en masse the ethnic Vietnamese community in Cambodia. Vietnam claims that ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia number only some 150,000, while Cambodia insists the figure is considerably higher, as many as one million by some counts, with most of them being illegal economic migrants. Meanwhile, Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk has accused Vietnam of annexing large parts of Cambodian territory during its occupation in the 1980s by 'unlawfully' moving border markers far inside Cambodia. Ranariddh has similarly called on the Vietnamese to restore the borders to those existing before his father, King Sihanouk, was ousted from power in 1970. A Cambodian diplomatic source said the two sides have agreed to abide by accords signed in the 1960s between Sihanouk and then North Vietnam, in which the two sides pledged to respect a 1954 map left by the French colonial rulers. But he said the two sides still differ when it comes to 'delimitation on the ground.' Former Cambodia Finance Minister Sam Rainsy recently estimated that Cambodia has lost at least 6,000 square kilometers to Vietnam since 1979, with border markers having been moved inside Cambodia 10 km on average. One hurdle is how to deal with subsequent border agreements, including one on the sea border signed in the 1980s between Hanoi and the Vietnamese-installed Heng Samrin regime. During Kiet's brief visit to Phnom Penh the previous April, the two sides agreed to set up 'expert working groups' on the demarcation of boundaries and the issue of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia. The groups will be formally established during the current visit. Partially in response to passage of Cambodia's controversial immigration law, Vietnam has tightened up enforcement of a previous agreement on maritime commerce on the Mekong River, hindering traffic to and from Phnom Penh. The two countries are also wrangling over the dimensions of a bridge to be built with Australian assistance over a portion of the Mekong River at My Thuan, 125 km southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam wants to lower the bridge's air clearance as a cost-cutting measure, which would effectively restrict navigation of big ships to Phnom Penh. Hanoi says all maritime traffic should be shifted to the Bassac River by dredging the waterway's entrance.

Cambodian First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said on January 19, 1996, that if an "invasion" by Vietnam on Cambodian territory in three southeastern provinces is not resolved through dialogues with the Vietnamese embassy in Phnom Penh, he will travel to Vietnam to speak directly to the country's premier. "If the (Vietnamese embassy) does not comply, I will go to Hanoi and talk directly to (Prime Minister) Vo Van Kiet," said Prince Ranariddh, adding that the encroachment of Vietnam earlier this month, which he called "an invasion," violates provisions of a joint declaration set up between the two countries to settle questions of demarcation of disputed border areas. Hanoi pledged to uphold Cambodia's territorial sovereignty in a statement which appeared in the official language Vietnam News. Ranaridhh said that recent skirmishes in Svay Rieng province had left one Cambodian policeman dead and two Vietnamese injured. Border markers near land in Svay Rieng province had been shifted between 300-400 meters into Cambodia and Vietnamese had displaced Cambodian farmers who had been cultivating rice there last year, he said. "If there is a violation of the joint committee provisions, then we have to react," said Prince Ranariddh. He said that if a resolution cannot be agreed between the country's co-prime ministers, he will bring the issue to the attention of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Cambodia enjoys observers status at ASEAN and Vietnam is a full member. A statement released by the Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom Penh underlined Vietnam's respect for Cambodia's sovereignty and territorial integrity and said a "Vietnamese Expert Working Group" was prepared to meet with the Cambodian counterparts to discuss and settle all the remaining issues of the border problem." Foreign Minister Ung Huot said that he had met with Vietnam's Ambassador to Cambodia Tran Huy Chuong, and he expressed confidence that careful diplomacy could solve the affair. A spokesman at the Vietnamese Embassy said "Cambodians often cross into Vietnam and Vietnamese people into Cambodia," and such traffic did not constitute "an invasion".

On January 24, 1996, renewed hostilities occurred as MID4004 took place. MID4004 ended on January 30, 1996. Several minor incidents occurred between Vietnamese frontier guards and security forces from Cambodia. Reports on the incidents vary. It was reported that Cambodian border guards violated Vietnamese territory. There were also reports that 200 members of the Cambodian security forces had crossed the frontier into Vietnamese territory. Cambodians often lease land to Vietnamese from across the border, resulting in disputes over ownership. It was also reported that a number of Vietnamese police and civilians built houses and tilled lands in the areas inside Cambodia's eastern provinces. It was also claimed that the Vietnamese had occupied six villages along the border. There were reports of unprovoked firing across the border, the killing of a Cambodian policeman and several injuries in Vietnam, with the two sides trading accusations. Subsequent to the dispute, Cambodia and Vietnam agreed to seek a peaceful solution to their border dispute. Though Cambodia and Vietnam agreed to resolve their border dispute peacefully, they have not finalized a border agreement demarcating the border and resolving their dispute. They have however developed closer bilateral ties since the last MID.

Vietnam has strongly denied an allegation by Cambodia's ousted first premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, that Vietnam was involved in the situation in Cambodia. 'Ranariddh's allegation is irresponsible and totally groundless,' a spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said on August 21, 1997. He was answering a question by the Vietnam News Agency on the prince's recent statement on Radio France International that there was evidence of a link between Vietnam and the recent developments of the situation in Cambodia. 'Vietnam's consistent stance is to respect Cambodia's independence and sovereignty, and not to interfere in its internal affairs,' the spokesman said. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in early 1979, overthrowing the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge regime and installing a pro-Vietnamese government headed by Hun Sen, who is now Cambodia's second prime minister. Prince Ranariddh, head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, and Hun Sen became first and second prime ministers, respectively, in a coalition government in Cambodia after a general election held in 1993 under the supervision of the United Nations. Hun Sen ousted Prince Ranaridh in early July, which led the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to a decision to indefinitely postpone the admission of the country into the regional grouping. Cambodia's National Assembly early this month elected Foreign Minister Ung Huot as first prime minister to replace Prince Ranariddh. Troops loyal to Hun Sen are storming the last stronghold of the prince's forces in the northwest of the country, and tens of thousands of civilian refugees have crossed the border into Thailand. Prince Ranariddh is traveling to many countries to drum up international support for his efforts against his ouster.

The last MID of RIV1335, MID4004, ended on January 29, 1996. Two decades after sending troops into Cambodia to oust the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam was again extending its neighbor a helping hand, not with guns this time but by supporting its bid to join ASEAN on the eve of the group's summit in Hanoi, on December 9, 1998.

Cambodia's foreign minister arrived in the Vietnamese capital on April 29, 1999, a day ahead of a ceremony in which his country was to be admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). "This is a happy day for Cambodia," Hor Nam Hong told reporters as he entered the Hanoi hotel, where he and the nine other ASEAN foreign ministers were to gather for a special signing and flag-raising ceremony. The admission of the poor and strife-torn nation to ASEAN will round out the regional grouping, which had prepared to welcome Cambodia into the fold as its tenth member nearly two years ago. A bloody coup in July 1997, which saw forces loyal to strongman Hun Sen battle and eventually defeat the troops of his political rival and co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, put the scheduled entry on ice. The two adversaries eventually reconciled and formed a coalition government led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, and the country is now seeing unprecedented peace and stability. Hor Nam Hong said his country's admission would create "a big, open market of 500 million people for Cambodia's goods". "We have prepared everything to be a member of ASEAN already," he added when asked how Phnom Penh will come up with the roughly 5 million dollars in joining expenses. Phnom Penh has been actively preparing for its admission since the last ASEAN Summit, in Hanoi last December, when Vietnam announced that Cambodia's ascension had been secured despite objections from Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. The remaining members-Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar (Burma)-effectively threw their weight behind the admission. Hanoi has been criticized for its blunt tactics to secure entry for Cambodia and a place at the table for Vietnam's close political ally, Hun Sen. "It looks like Vietnam is calling all the shots," an Asian defence attache said, adding that growing fragmentation is threatening to crack ASEAN's veneer of unity. "There was a danger of ASEAN being dismissed" by foreign investors, said a diplomat from a member country in Hanoi. "But we are very relevant. ASEAN is still alive and kicking." The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also dismissed any significance in the date of the ceremony. Friday, April 30, marks the 24th anniversary of the fall of Saigon to the communist forces of North Vietnam. "I appreciate the connection, but it was not deliberate," the diplomat said. "That's what we call a good old-fashioned coincidence."

Vietnam and its neighbor Cambodia aim to resolve long-standing border disputes by 2000 and boost trade ties, official media reported on May 26, 1999. Hanoi also hopes Phnom Penh will ease tense living conditions for Vietnam's large expatriate community in Cambodia, the communist party daily Nhan Dan (The People) reported. The two governments agreed on the border deadline during a visit to Vietnam by Cambodia's parliament president Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the report said. Ranariddh met Vietnam's troika of leaders, including Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, who suggested Cambodia and Vietnam "actively solve the (border) issue," the report said. Vietnam and Cambodia are historical enemies and there have been many border disputes. Hanoi invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime and stayed in Phnom Penh for over a decade. Strongman Hun Sen, now Prime Minister of Cambodia, was installed as a young foreign minister in Phnom Penh by Vietnamese forces and has been a loyal ally of Hanoi ever since. But ethnic Khmers have a deep-seated mistrust of Vietnam and many openly accuse Hanoi of harboring expansionist plans and meddling in Cambodia's internal affairs. Phan Van Khai told Ranariddh, who briefly fought against Hanoi-backed troops in Cambodia in the 1980s, that he hoped Phnom Penh would create more favorable conditions for Vietnamese expatriates living in Cambodia, Nhan Dan reported. Opposition leaders regularly stirred up anti-Vietnamese sentiments at rallies ahead of last year's national elections, and demonstrators stoned and beat to death at least a dozen Vietnamese nationals. Ranariddh told reporters in Hanoi Tuesday that Hun Sen's government had no plans to provide any special treatment for Vietnamese expatriates.

The Vietnam-Cambodia Border Joint Committee held a special meeting session in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, between 14 and 18 June, 2002. At the meeting the Vietnamese and Cambodian sides reached an agreement on the upgrade and establishment of more border posts along the borderline between the two countries. Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Le Cong Phung, who is also head of the Vietnamese delegation to the conference, and head of the Cambodian delegation Va Kimhong, adviser to the government on border issues, signed in the morning the minutes of the meeting. Vietnamese Ambassador to Cambodia Nguyen Duy Hung was present at the signing ceremony. The two officials issued a joint press release, which said that acting on recommendations made by provinces concerned from both countries, the two sides agreed to submit proposals to their respective governments for upgrading and opening more border points of entry-exit to facilitate the activities of economic and cultural exchange from both sides. Under the proposal, the Tinh Bien Border Post in Vietnam's An Giang Province and the Phnom Den in Cambodia's Takev Province will be made international border posts.

The construction of Dinh Ba bridge, spanning the So Ha river between Vietnam and Cambodia, began at the Dinh Ba border gate in Dong Thap province on Septemher 9, 2005. The Vietnamese Ambassador to Cambodia, the Cambodia Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City, representatives of the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Cambodian Secretary of State attended the ground-breaking ceremony. The bridge, 123.5-m long, 7-m wide, linking Dinh Ba border gate in Vietnam's southern Dong Thap province with Bontiachacray border gate in Cambodia's Prayveng province, will be built at a cost of 5.413 billion dong (US$340.7 million).

An agreement on post and telecom cooperation between Vietnam and Cambodia was signed in Phnom Penh during the 8-12 June, 2003 visit by a delegation of Vietnam's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications MPT, led by MPT Minister Do Trung Ta. Under the agreement, the two sides will continue strengthening cooperation by setting up joint working groups to exchange experiences, coordinating control of TV waves, and use of the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh City optical cable line. Vietnam will also help Cambodia train technicians and managers while Cambodia will offer Vietnamese investors favorable and fair treatment in the market. On 9 June, 2003, the Vietnamese delegation met Prime Minister Hun Sen, who outlined Cambodia's negotiations for WTO World Trade Organization accession and expressed his hope that Cambodia would be admitted to the organization by the end of the year. Minister Do Trung Ta expressed his wish to boost bilateral cooperation and develop a market for Vietnamese products and services in Cambodia.

Senior officials from Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security and Cambodia's Ministry of the Interior met in Phnom Penh on December 19, 2003, to discuss ways to boost cooperation on border security. Addressing the meeting, the second of its kind, Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Sar Kheng stressed the need to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in safeguarding border security in a bid to prevent hostile forces from entering either country for sabotage, thereby ensuring security, stability and peace for both countries. Reports delivered at the meeting acknowledged that security cooperation between the two countries has been efficient and recognized the need to enhance closer collaboration between local border security forces in combating drug and human trafficking, terrorism and transnational crimes.

On 10 October, 2004, the Vietnamese Party General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, President Tran Duc Luong and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai all congratulated Prime Minister Hun Sen on Cambodia's admission to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) at separate receptions in Hanoi on 9 October, 2004. Speaking to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, General Secretary Manh said he believed that Cambodia will make positive contributions to ASEM as well as regional and international cooperation. He appreciated Cambodia's great achievements, especially the recent establishment of a new government and National Assembly in the country. The party leader thanked the Cambodian people for their valuable support and assistance to Vietnam. He reiterated Vietnam's policy to attach importance to the traditional friendship and cooperation with Cambodia for peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region and the world at large. General Secretary Manh asked PM Hun Sen to convey his best regards to King Norodom Sihanouk, his wife and other Cambodian leaders. PM Hun Sen thanked Vietnam, host of ASEM 5, for its active support for Cambodia's admission to ASEM together with Laos, Myanmar Burma and ten European countries. He said he hoped for further development of the traditional friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Cambodia and Vietnam in the interest of the two peoples and for peace, cooperation and development in the region and the world.

The Vietnam-Cambodia bilateral ties, set up in June 1967, have developed in line with the principles mentioned by the Vietnam-Cambodia joint communiques issued on 25 January, 1992 and in 1995. Vietnam and Cambodia defined orientations for bilateral cooperation in the 21st century as "good neighbourliness, traditional solidarity and friendship and long-term stability" during the visit to Cambodia in June 1999 by General Secretary Le Kha Phieu of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Both countries have increased the exchange of high-level visits, including the visits to Vietnam by Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath Sihanouk, Senate President Samdech Chea Sim, Prime Minister Hun Sen and King Norodom Sihamoni and the visits to Cambodia by Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Nong Duc Manh, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, and National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Van An. The two sides have signed a number of cooperation documents. They include the supplementary treaty to the Vietnam-Cambodia Border Delimitation Treaty signed in 1985, a cultural cooperation plan, a protocol on the implementation of the Vietnam-Cambodia road traffic agreement, an agreement of granting credits to upgrade a section of Highway 78 from Ban Lung to O Yadav in Cambodian province of Rattanakiri, a cooperation agreement on the trafficking of women and children and supporting those victims, and a memorandum of understanding on an agreement to facilitate cross-border goods transportation along the Moc Bai and Ba Vet border gates. On 26 May, 2006, Vietnam and Cambodia signed the minutes on a document approving the Vietnam-Cambodia consular agreement. This is the second one that Vietnam has signed with other member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). In the field of security and national defense, Vietnam and Cambodia signed an Agreement on Historical Common Territorial Waters in July 1982. One year later, the two countries inked a Treaty on Principles to Resolve Border Issues and an Agreement on Border Statute. In December 1985, the two sides signed an Agreement on National Border Demarcation. Trade relations between Vietnam and Cambodia have steadily been on the upturn, with an average 30 per cent growth of the two-way trade turnover per year. Vietnam is now Cambodia's third largest partner, after Thailand and Singapore, exporting mainly farm products, food, plastic and aluminum wares to Cambodia. Meanwhile, Cambodia exports rubber and forest products to Vietnam. In terms of investment, Vietnamese enterprises have so far poured 25m US dollars into projects in Cambodia, mostly in the fields of garments and textiles, and construction materials production. By the end of December 2005, Cambodian investors had invested in four projects in Vietnam with a combined operational capital of 4m US dollars. Substantial achievements can also be seen in tourism cooperation between the two countries. In 2005, Vietnam received around 245,000 Cambodian tourists, doubling the figure of 2004. Vietnam and Cambodia have also agreed to boost their cooperation in education, healthcare, and social welfare sectors. The two sides have signed a 2006-2010 Protocol on Education and Training Cooperation. In 2004, Ho Chi Minh City funded the construction of a 20m US dollar hospital in Cambodia's capital city of Phnom Penh. At present, around 100,000 Vietnamese people are living in Cambodia. Since its establishment in 2003, the Vietnamese community in Cambodia has made appreciable contributions to their native country. On 5 June, Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia raised 1,800 US dollars as relief for Typhoon Chanchu victims in central Vietnam. In the first five months of 2006, they collected 8,400 US dollars to help build houses for poor people in An Giang and Dong Thap provinces, which share a common border with Cambodia.
