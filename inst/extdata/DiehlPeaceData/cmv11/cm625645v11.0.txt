TERRMID-CER: MID122 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID122 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID122 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID122 from Gibler 2018, Iraq claimed all of Kuwait as Iraqi territory in 1961 and threatened to annex it. In response, the Arab League admitted Kuwait as a member and formed a coalition to defend it from Iraqi invasion. As part of the Arab League, Sudan issued a threat to Iraq, warning them not to use force against Kuwait. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to Iraq's claim on all of Kuwait's territory. 

MARITMID: MID122 3 -- not maritime 
MARITMID-CER: MID122 1 -- certain
MARITMID-NOTES: MID122 Because Iraq claimed all of Kuwait, this included a claim on Kuwait's maritime waters. Coded not maritime because the maritime dispute is not between Sudan and Iraq, but Sudan is linked to the maritime dispute between Iraq and Kuwait here.
