NARRATIVE-CR:
British influence increased in the south and eastern portion of Yemen after the British captured the port of Aden in 1839. It was ruled as part of British India until 1937, when Aden was made a crown colony with the remaining land designated as east Aden and west Aden protectorates. By 1965, most of the tribal states within the protectorates and the Aden colony proper had joined to form the British-sponsored federation of south Arabia.

The issue between Yemen and the UK stems from the British possession of Aden, a protectorate within the British Empire until 1967 and Yemeni interest in British withdrawal from Yemen. British military aircraft attacked targets in North Yemen in March 1949, resulting in the death of one British military personnel (MID604). The British attacked a border post that was established within British controlled area. 

MID259 occurred from June of 1956 until September of 1958. British and North Yemeni representatives signed an agreement on January 20, 1951, which provided for the establishment of a joint commission to demarcate the border between the Aden protectorate and North Yemen. On January 2, 1957, North Yemen protested the bombing of its territory by British military aircraft, but Britain rejected the protest on January 8, 1957. North Yemeni troops occupied territory in the Aden Protectorate on January 12, 1957, and British troops attacked Yemeni territory on January 14-15, 1957. The United States appealed for a ceasefire on January 17, 1957. British troops and North Yemeni troops clashed near the border on January 27, 1957, resulting in the deaths of 30 North Yemeni soldiers. Yemen claimed sovereignty over the Aden protectorate on January 30, 1957. British military aircraft attacked North Yemeni troops in the border region on February 1-2, 1957. British troops and military aircraft clashed with North Yemeni troops near the border on January 30, 1958. North Yemen accused Britain of aggression, and referred the matter to the United Nations (UN) Security Council on February 27, 1958. Britain rejected the accusations on March 6, 1958. North Yemeni troops shot down a British military aircraft on July 8, 1958. 

British troops and North Yemeni tribesmen clashed near the border on June 22-23, 1963, resulting in the deaths of four British soldiers and three tribesmen. North Yemen referred the matter to the UN Security Council on June 24, 1963. North Yemen military aircraft attacked targets in the South Arabian Federation on March 27, 1964. British military aircraft retaliated by attacking Harib fort in North Yemen on March 28, 1964, resulting in the deaths of 25 individuals. North Yemen referred the matter to the UN Security Council on April 1, 1964, and the UN Security Council condemned Britain for the attack against Harib on April 9, 1964. These incidents constitute MID610 and MID2157. 

MID2155 occurred in December of 1966 until April of 1967. This mid is the last days of the dispute between N. Yemen and the UK as Britain made its final withdrawals from the protectorate of Aden in South Yemen. There were various low level incidents during this period between the British and the N. Yemenis. 

By the late 1950s, an earlier proposal to federate some of the smaller states had grown into a much broader scheme to include all of the principalities and sheikhdoms into a larger political entity that would eventually achieve independence from the British. 

Britain's insistence that Aden be a part of the new entity created the anomaly that eventually killed the plan. The sophisticated business community, the activist trade unions, and other similarly modern political and social organizations in Aden feared for their future at the hands of what they perceived to be a group of largely illiterate and parochial tribal leaders from the rural areas of the protectorates. The tribal leaders, on the other hand, feared at worst their overthrow, or at best a degree of political and economic participation severely limited by an Adeni population that included many non-Muslims and non-Arabs.

An acceleration of violence in Aden and the surrounding areas occurred in the early 1960s. Several groups worked together and independently to oust the British. They used a number of tactics including bombings of civilian British and strikes. In October of 1964, a Labor government was elected in Britain. They favored talks with one of the primary opposition groups the AUTC. The violence continued. More and more soldiers were required to ensure the security of Aden which at the time was seen as a vital link to the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Aden was seen as ensuring the security of British passage to the Indian Ocean. At some point in the early 1960s, after the Labor government came to power it was decided that the security provided by the basing at Aden was not worth the naval security it produced. Thus in February of 1966, London announced that the British would leave by 1968 and no defense agreement would be established to protect the post independence government. This announcement unleashed the violent political conflict that prevailed in Aden and the protectorates for the next two years as assorted organizations fought for control of the destiny of South Yemen. 

The establishment of a republic in North Yemen provided a tremendous incentive to the elements in the south that sought to eliminate the British presence there. Furthermore, the Egyptians agreed to provide support for some of the organizations campaigning for southern independence-e.g., the Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (FLOSY). However, not all elements in either of the two Yemens were sympathetic to Egyptian policies, much less to the dominant role that Egypt had begun to play in southwestern Arabia. An emergent alternative movement, the National Liberation Front (NLF), drew its support primarily from indigenous sources. As the time for independence drew near, the conflict between the various groups, and especially the NLF and FLOSY, escalated into open warfare for the right to govern the state after British withdrawal. By late 1967, the NLF clearly had the upper hand; the British finally accepted the inevitable and arranged the transfer of sovereignty to the NLF on Nov. 30, 1967 and evacuated the country.
