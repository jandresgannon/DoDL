TERRMID: MID1672 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1672 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1672 from Gibler 2018, this is connected to the issue of Tangier, a disputed city in Morocco to which several countries had claims. In 1923, UK, France, and Spain signed an agreement to create distinct administrative zones in Tangier, which Italy opposed because of its claims. In 1927, Italy deployed warships to Tangier, making a show of force directed toward France, UK, and Spain. Coded territorial MID because France and Italy were both making a claim on Tangier here, and a show of force occurred that was connected to the disputed territory of Tangier.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Tangier is a city in Morocco that was made an international zone under the control of France, Spain and Britain in 1923. Mussolini's policy of Italian expansion into Africa led to conflict with Spain in several occasions (MID1672). The conflict was over Italian expansion into Morocco. Italy wanted control over the international zone. The events were settled in 1928 with the addition of Italy as a protectorate over Tangier (Killinger 2002). MID210 was over Italian involvement in the Spanish Civil War. For Italy and Germany the Spanish Civil war was a chance to test out their new methods of Tank and Air warfare. France and Britain were concerned about the shifting balance of power into the Fascist state's favor. The conflict was resolved with the rise of the fascist state in Spain and the defeat of the Republican government in November of 1936 (www.onwar.com). MID258 and MID3837 were both exclusively over the Second World War. MID3837 involved Axis invasion of one of the Canary Islands controlled by Spain in 1940. Resolution of the conflict between Spain and Italy in WWII came about in November of 1944 the Protocols of Rome were drafted and signed which promised that after victory over fascism in Italy was achieved in totality with the return of control to the Italian Badoglio government as well as return territory held by Allied troops in Northern Italy (Willis 1971). Finally after the signing of the peace treaty of 1947 foreign and domestic holdings were returned and complete control over policy was returned to Italy (Willis 1971).
