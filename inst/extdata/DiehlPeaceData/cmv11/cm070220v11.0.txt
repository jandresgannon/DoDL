RIVNOTES: 
RIV10194 is a combination of two rivalries that did not meet the time density criteria. Yet MID160 and MID135 (Franco-Mexican War) both involve French military actions to assert claims and demand debt repayment from Mexico through the use of military force. Similarities in issues and actions led to combining these disputes into one rivalry. Because there are only two disputes, however, it remains in the isolated rivalry category.
