MARITMID-NOTES: MID239 from cm narrative, occurred in September of 1864. Naval forces of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands compelled Japan and the Prince of Nagato in particular to permit the Straits of Shimonoseki to be used by foreign shipping in accordance with treaties already signed. Coded not maritime because no maritime boundary disputes were present here; this was an issue of commerce and treaty enforcement.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID1767 from cm narrative, occurred in October(10-25) of 1908. The United States deployed the US Battleship fleet to the Pacific in response to a war scare with Japan. However, New York Times articles from that time indicate that the US fleet in Japan was coordinated between the two countries and Japan welcomed the US fleet as a sign of solidifying their friendship with the US (NYT 10/18/1908). Coded not maritime because US and Japan not disputing maritime boundary, and it is not clear that this is actually a MID. Uncertainty raised because itâ€™s not clear this is actually a MID.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID248 occurred from January 31-February 13, 1932. Here the US Navy landed in China to protect American interests during Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Japan had attacked Shanghai in order to repress protesters there. Japan was occupying Manchuria at the time and installed a puppet state. Coded third party link to territory because while Japan was not attempting to annex the territory of Manchuria, Japan was asserting its right to exert absolute administration over the area due to its lease of the Manchurian Railway. This amounts to Japan claiming sovereignty over the territory, making that a territorial claim and this a third party link to that claim.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1825 (1937) involved a clash in China due to Japanese invasion in China. Japan was intending to extract resources, not claim Chinese territory as its own. However, Japan was effectively asserting sovereignty over the Chinese territory by occupying it, monopolizing the use of force within that territory, and extracting its resources. This MID is therefore coded third party link to territorial MID.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1825 from cm narrative, occurred December 1937. The Chinese Civil War was ongoing and the Japanese had invaded China in order to extract resources for Japan's domestic and international trade. The US deployed gunboats in the Yangtze River to evacuate US personnel from the embassy, and Japan attacked the US vessels, killing several people. Coded civil war MID because the Japanese presence in China was connected to the ongoing Chinese Civil War, which is outside of this dyad, and the US gunboats were attacked by Japan in this context.

NARRATIVE-CR:
During the early part of the 17th century, Japan's shogunate suspected that traders and missionaries were actually forerunners of a military conquest by European powers. This caused the shogunate to place foreigners under progressively tighter restrictions. Ultimately, Japan forced all foreigners to leave and barred all relations with the outside world except for severely restricted commercial contacts with Dutch and Chinese merchants at Nagasaki. This isolation lasted for 200 years, until Commodore Matthew Perry of the U.S. Navy forced the opening of Japan to the West with the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. 

Within several years, renewed contact with the West profoundly altered Japanese society. The shogunate was forced to resign, and the emperor was restored to power. The 'Meiji restoration' of 1868 initiated many reforms. The feudal system was abolished, and numerous Western institutions were adopted, including a Western legal system and constitutional government along quasi-parliamentary lines. 

It is during this period (1863-4) that the US and Japan engaged in their first militarized conflict: MID13 and MID239. On July 16, 1863 the USS Wyoming retaliated against a firing on the American vessel Pembroke at Shimonosek (MID13). From July 14 through August 3, 1864 naval forces protected the United States Minister to Japan when he visited Yedo to negotiate concerning some American claims against Japan, and to make his negotiations easier by impressing the Japanese with American power. MID239 occurred in September of 1864 (4-14). Naval forces of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands compelled Japan and the Prince of Nagato in particular to permit the Straits of Shimonoseki to be used by foreign shipping in accordance with treaties already signed.

In 1898, the last of the 'unequal treaties' with Western powers was removed, signaling Japan's new status among the nations of the world. In a few decades, by creating modern social, educational, economic, military, and industrial systems, the Emperor Meiji's 'controlled revolution' had transformed a feudal and isolated state into a world power. 

MID1488 `Korean Invasion Rumor' is coded as occurring from October through November of 1885. Korea requested American officers to train its troops, but states that this request was never granted. Although there was naval action by the British and Russians in April 1885, the U.S. did not have forces in the area. 

MID1767 occurred in October(10-25) of 1908. The United States deployed the US Battleship fleet to the Pacific in response to a war scare with Japan.

Shallow draft gunboats of the U.S. Navy sailed China's largest river for over 50 years before being officially organized as the Yangtze Patrol Force in August, 1921. These ships protected U.S. citizens against the bandits and warlord forces in a turbulent China. In the mid-1920's, the internal struggle for power was accompanied by many acts of violence against foreigners. Units of the Yangtze Patrol, reinforced by destroyers and light cruisers from the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, steamed upriver to protect Americans and national interests. Numerous confrontations occurred. When the situation stabilized an uneasy peace returned to the Yangtze valley, and the gunboats resumed anti-bandit activities. In the early 1930s severe floods along the entire river valley brought the gunboats and additional ships of the Asiatic Fleet into action again, this time in the humanitarian cause of aiding the millions of Chinese left homeless by the catastrophe. 

MID248 occurred from January 31-February 13, 1932. Here the US Navy landed in China to protect American interests during Japanese occupation of Shanghai. 

MID1825 `U.S.S. Panay' occurred on December 12, 1937. The USS Panay, was a U.S. gunboat on patrol in China. It was one of several vessels built for the Yangtze River patrol to protect U.S. interests during the Chinese civil war. Japanese forces invaded China in July 1937, and on December 11, the last officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nanking were evacuated aboard Panay. The Panay and the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company tankers Mei Ping, Mei Hsia, and Mei An sailed upriver, notifying the local Japanese commander of their intention to do so. The next day, the Japanese ordered the destruction of all shipping on the Yangtze above Nanking. Japanese dive-bombers attacked the clearly marked American flotilla about 27 miles from Nanking. Panay was abandoned after an hour and sank with the loss of 2 killed and 48 wounded. Mei An was sunk with the loss of her skipper, Captain Carl H. Carlson, and several dozen of her crew. The United States lodged a formal protest. The Roosevelt administration considered economic sanctions against Japan, but decided to do nothing after the Japanese apologized and offered compensation. 

MID258 is World War II. On December 8, 1941, the United States declared war with Japan, on December 11 with Germany and Italy, and on June 5, 1942, with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. The United States declared war against Japan after the surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor, and against Germany and Italy after those nations, under the dictators Hitler and Mussolini, declared war against the United States.

MID339 is the increasing tension between Japan and the US prior to and including the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This MID is coded as joining an ongoing war. 

The Japanese formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. The Allied forces occupied the Japanese islands, imposed a new constitution, and relegated the Emperor of Japan to the status of a figurehead. The imposed constitution mandated that future Japanese military forces be used only for self-defense. The US and 46 other non-communist states signed a peace treaty with Japan on September 8, 1951 in San Francisco. This treaty returned Japan to its pre-1895 borders. The Philippines and other American Pacific territories that had been seized by the Japanese were returned. This treaty ceded the Ryukyu and Bonin islands to the United States, along with a number of other Pacific island groups. The island of Formosa was ceded to China. Korea was to become an independent state. Japanese Premier Yoshida protested that the treaty stripped Japan of 45% of its territory (all of its holdings in Asia and the Pacific) and left Japan unable to pay reparations claims on the part of the Allies. The treaty also permitted the seizure of Japanese assets in allied countries to provide compensation for damages inflicted by the Japanese during the war. A treaty providing for the continuing presence of US forces in Japan was signed on September 8, 1951. This provided for the indefinite presence of major US forces in Japan and an American veto over any Japanese offers of basing rights to third powers. The defense treaty stipulated that American forces had the right to use bases in Japan to combat outside powers to protect "international peace and security" as well as the right to deploy troops within Japan to combat "internal riots and disturbances". The Treaty of San Francisco was formally ratified by the required number of allied powers on April 15, 1952 and took effect on April 28, 1952. A mutual defense treaty between the US and Japan was signed on January 19, 1960. A provision of this treaty provided for basing rights for American troops in Japan.

Despite the changes in the post-Cold War strategic landscape, the U.S.-Japan alliance continues to be based on shared vital interests. These include stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the preservation and promotion of political and economic freedoms, support for human rights and democratic institutions. 

Japan continues to provide bases and financial and material support to U.S. forward-deployed forces, which are essential for maintaining stability in the region. Under the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, Japan hosts a carrier battle group, the III Marine Expeditionary Force, the 5th Air Force, and the Army's 9th Theater Support Command. The United States currently maintains approximately 53,000 troops in Japan, approximately half of whom are stationed in Okinawa. 

Over the past several years the alliance has been strengthened through revised Defense Guidelines, which expand Japans non-combat role in a regional contingency, the Special Action Committee on Okinawa (SACO) program to consolidate U.S. military presence in Okinawa, the 2001 5-year agreement on Host Nation Support of U.S. forces stationed in Japan, and technical cooperation on ballistic missile defense. After the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Japan has participated significantly with the Global War on Terrorism by providing major logistical support for U.S. and coalition forces in the Indian Ocean. Japan also has played a leading role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as in the political and economic rehabilitation of Iraq. Their efforts include the passage of historic legislation allowing Japans Self-Defense Forces to participate in reconstruction and humanitarian missions to Iraq; by April 2004 nearly 1000 SDF troops were operating in the southern Iraqi city of Al Samawah.
