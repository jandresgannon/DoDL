PS-UPDATE2020: Much of the lesser rivalry between these two states involved FARC rebels with bases in Ecuador and cross-border raid by Colombia. The peace accord between FARC and Colombia in 2016 removes that issue from the relationship, and therefore the end of the lesser rivalry. Some disagrements between the two sides remain, but not at the level of a rivalry. In addition, violence thereafter involving the border and the two countries did not involve the two governments, but drug wars, kidnappings, and other actors by non-government actors.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2051 from cm narrative, Colombia and Peru were threatening each other with war over a territorial dispute they had in the Amazon. Ecuador threatened to go to war if its boundary was violated during that war, triggering this MID. This was essentially a threat issued by Ecuador to deter the spillover of conflict. Coded third party link to territory because this was connected to a Colombia-Peru territorial dispute.

On 8/12/2009, Ecuador again deployed troops to its border with Colombia and demanded that Colombia permanently patrol its side of the border as a condition of resuming diplomatic relations with Colombia, which Ecuador terminated after Colombia attacked FARC rebels inside Ecuador in 3/2008. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to rebel group activity in Colombia.

The dispute commenced with a border violation on 3/1/2008 or 3/2/2008 in which Colombia killed a number of FARC rebels inside Ecuador, including senior FARC member Raul Reyes. In response, Ecuador and Venezuela deployed troops to fortify their respective borders with Colombia. Venezuelan border fortifications continued as of 3/4/2008. On 5/17/2008, Venezuela charged that Colombian troops had crossed the border into Venezuela. Venezuela announced that it had stopped the Colombian troops on the Venezuelan side of the border, and issued a protest to Colombia. On 5/19/2008, Venezuela announced that a separate group of Colombian troops that had crossed into its territory left at the request of Venezuelan troops. There were no other disputes between Colombia and Ecuador, or between Colombia and Venezuela, in the remainder of 2008. First day of dispute is listed on 3/2/2008 and last day of dispute is listed on 3/3/2008.

Similar to previous MIDs involving Ecuador and Colombia, the underlying issue between the two countries remains to be military tensions over actions against rebels operating in the two countries. On 3/7/2009 and 3/18/2009, Ecuador deployed troops to fortify its border with Colombia, officially in response to the infiltration of Colombian paramilitaries, particularly the right- wing AUC, into Ecuador. On 8/12/2009, Ecuador again deployed troops to its border with Colombia and demanded that Colombia permanently patrol its side of the border as a condition of resuming diplomatic relations with Colombia, which Ecuador terminated after Colombia attacked FARC rebels inside Ecuador in 3/2008.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Colombia and Ecuador disputed the Oriente-Aguarico border region beginning on August 16, 1832. Colombian troops and Ecuadorian troops engaged in military hostilities between August 17 and October 9, 1832. Colombian and Ecuadorian representatives signed a peace agreement in Pasto on December 8, 1832. Ecuador issued several decrees in 1901, which created four departments in the disputed region and established custom houses in Aguarcio and La Coca. Colombia formally protested the Ecuadorian decrees on February 20, 1902. The countries signed an arbitration agreement in Bogota on November 5, 1904, which provided for the submission of the border dispute to the emperor of Germany. The arbitration agreement was never put into effect. The countries held bilateral negotiations from November 4, 1915 to July 13, 1916, resulting in the signing of a border treaty in Bogota on July 15, 1916. The treaty established a six-person mixed boundary commission to demarcate the border. The commission completed its work on July 9, 1919. Ecuador severed diplomatic relations with Colombia following the Colombian ratification of a border treaty which was signed on March 24, 1922 by Colombia and Peru. Ecuador alleged that Colombia had an agreement with Ecuador to not cede formerly Ecuadorian territory to another country without the approval of Ecuador. The countries resumed diplomatic relations on August 18, 1931.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The first mid occurs in 1857, (MID1521 on 11/15) and seems to involve threats from Venezuela, Great Britain, Spain, Peru and Colombia against Ecuador regarding the property of ex-president Juan Flores, although the evidence on this is very limited. The two countries also were in dispute over the Oriente-Aguarico territory from 1854-1919 although there appears to have been no militarized disputes over this issue. The final two disputes during this period involved Colombian threats to the integrity of Ecuadorian borders and are described in futher detail below.

In June 1862, Colombian and Ecuadorian forces clashed over border incursions by Conservative Colombian forces in the midst of a civil war (MID1520 on 6/19/1862). During one of the border incursions, an Ecuadorian officer was shot. President Garcia Moreno immediately sent forces to attack Colombia but was quickly defeated by Colombian forces led by Julio Arboleda on July 31, 1862. President Moreno who had led the attack was captured and then released.

In August of 1863, Ecuador and Colombia again went to war over Colombian attempts to bring Ecuador into a restored Gran Colombia. Liberal President Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera of Colombia on August 15, 1863 called for Ecuadorian resistance to President Moreno in order to achieve the goal of reviving Gran Colombia. Ecuador immediately decided to wage war against Colombia. The Ecuadorian army was commanded by General Flores who invaded Colombia with the hopes that Conservatives there would join in the conflict to depose the Liberal Mosquera. The Conservatives did not join in the war and Colombian forces easily defeated General Flores at Cuaspud on December 6, 1863. The two countries signed a treaty at Pinzaqui on December 30, 1863. 

One of the reasons that conflict between the two countries ended during this period was probably due to the post-war settlement. The peace treaty did not require an Ecuadorian indemnity, lessening the humilation of the defeat, nor did it lead to the incorporation of Ecuador into a revived Gran Colombia. Preseident Mosquera, furthermore, called for liberal forces in Ecuador to cease plans for revolt and to work within the legal context of the law to promote Ecuador's national welfare. In terms of security, this seems to have reduced severely the threat of further Colombian intervention in Ecuador's internal politics. 

This of course was possible because of Mosquera's victory in the previous Colombian civil war that temporarily brought stability to Colombian politics. This period of stability allowed Colombia to focus on trying to consolidate the national government's power. This consolidation was necessary because of the great power of regional leaders prior to this point that created the ripe conditions for civil war in 1860. This consolidation and stability ended in 1876 when Colombia suffered a civil war. By this time, however, the potential rivalry between the two countries had certainly ended. With the domestic situation in Ecuador that existed since the last war between the two, there seems to be little doubt that this was true. 

In Ecuador, Garcia Moreno had reached a rather high level of unpopularity. This is reasonable considering that during the president's tenure Ecuador had been led into two unnecessary wars that both ended in defeat. In terms of costs, the conflicts cost close to $2 million pesos, which covered most of the money spent on the military over the prior three years. Despite the unpopularity, Garcia Moreno remained as president and began focusing on domestic concerns, increasing public works projects and improving relations with the church. Internal opposition continued to grow, however, leading to various plots and revolts during the president's term. In May 1863 and August 1864 two revolts were suppressed.

Additionally, tensions began to increase over disputes with Peru and by 1864 war between the two countries seemed inevitable. President Ramon Castilla and his administration in Peru had been supporting revolution attempts by Ecuadorian exiles that Ecuador began to strongly protest against. While tensions subsided after Castilla left office in July 1864, the Spanish seizure of Peru's Chincha islands and Ecuador's support of Spain (via the use of ports for supply and refueling) in 1864 provided another reason for potential conflict, limiting the possibility of restarting a dispute with Colombia. 

In 1865, Garcia Moreno was defeated by Jeronimo Carrion in the presidential elections. Carrion's presidency only lasted two years, when due to domestic pressure from a Liberal Congress, he resigned from office. In 1868, Dr. Javier Espinosa won the presidential elections. Espinosa's administration was preoccupied by a massive earthquake that hit the region in 1868, destroying the cities of Ibarra and Otavala and killing more than 20,000 people. In monetary costs, the earthquake caused over $40 million pesos in property damage. 

In 1869, Garcia Moreno returned to the presidency where he stayed until 1875. By this time there was certainly no longer any conflict or rivalry with Colombia. With Garcia Moreno's return, there certainly would not be as he was originally responsible for the disasters that occurred when the potential rivalry was initiated. 

The last mid (MID2051 on 11/14/1932) is not a part of the earlier conflict between Colombia and Ecuador. In an impending war between Colombia and Peru over Amazonian boundaries, Ecuador threatened to go to war to defend its posessions in the region if its boundaries were violated. 

PS-Narrative

20050701-20159999 .25

 Yearly MIDs between the two countries occur in the 2005-2009 period, with a particularly serious crisis in 2008 (current MID data end in 2010). Although the two sides restored diplomatic ties in 2010, significant hostility remained and the main issue of dispute, FARC rebel operations along the border with Ecuador remained.
