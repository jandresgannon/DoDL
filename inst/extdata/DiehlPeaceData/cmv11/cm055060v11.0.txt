DYAD: Grenada - St. Kitts and Nevis

PS: 19830919-19831022 0.75 19831023-19831101 0.25 19831102-20209999 0.75

PS-UPDATE2020: earlier period recoded to reflect that St. Kitts contributed troops to the Grenada invasion and thus there is a brief period of lesser rivalry, consistent with other CARICOM states involved in that invasion.

 Relationship is 0.75 due to mutual membership in CARICOM. Was not sure if this relationship should be temporarily downgraded as a result of the role St. Kitts and Nevis played in assisting the US in invading Grenada in October 1983.

“According to information available here, the assault was staged by at least 500 United States marines and army rangers and 300 soldiers from Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Vincent's, St. Lucia, Dominica and St. Kitts- Nevis, with about 1,500 Americans in a backup force offshore.”

Contiguous by less than 400 miles of water, but St. Kitts and Nevis has been Caribbean Common Market member since independence.
