CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID145 from cm002710v11.0 narrative, this is a naval incident involving US and allies (including Portugal here) vs. China that occurred February and March 1927. China had been divided along Communist and KMT (led by Chiang Kai-Shek, an anti-communist) fighting for years and would continue until 1949 as the Chinese Civil War. This MID occurred when fighting in Shanghai and Nanking caused US, Portugal and UK naval and ground forces to be increased at those locations, and some shelling of Chinese territory occurred to protect western interests. (Portugal was pulled into this MID by contributing some warships to the deployment.) Coded civil war MID because militarized factions in China broke out into fighting, threatening western interests and causing those countries to threaten and use force against China, with the assistance of Portugal, triggering this MID.
