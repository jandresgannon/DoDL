TERRLINK: MID3211 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID3211 3 -- uncertain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3211 from Gibler 2018, in 1954 Taiwan seized a Pakistani ship trading with China, and Pakistan protested. Coded third party link to territory because this was connected to the China-Taiwan dispute, as Taiwan was attempting to disrupt trade to China. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider China to be a party to this dispute, and it appears COW mistakenly has it coded as China instead of Taiwan opposing China.
