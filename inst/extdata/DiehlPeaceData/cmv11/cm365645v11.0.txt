CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3552 from cm200365 narrative, this is a multilateral MID involving Iraq vs. the US, UK, Turkey, France, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Iraq denied UN weapons inspectors entrance to various sites in Iraq. Other states protested in response, contributing to this MID. Also, Iraq threatened the safety of planes enforcing the no fly zone. In January 1993, the US, UK, and France raided several anti-aircraft missile sites. In June 1993, Iraq again refused UN access to a weapons plant. In June 1993, the US launched a cruise missile at an Iraqi intelligence headquarters building in response to an assassination attempt on Bush Sr as he was visiting Kuwait. Coded civil war MID because some of the events of this MID are connected to the no fly zone over Iraq, which was being enforced due to Saddam Hussein's attempts to conduct politicide against militarized rebel groups and civilians in parts of Iraq.
