TERRMID: MID134 1 -- territorial MID

TERRMID-NOTES: MID134 from Gibler 2018, this MID occurred in the lead-up to WWII. Lithuania was granted the territory of Memel after WWI, taken from Germany, and was still claiming it as part of its territory here in 1939. On 3/20/1939, Germany issued an ultimatum for Lithuania to surrender the territory or face invasion. Lithuania complied. Coded territorial MID because this was a threat of force that resulted in the exchange of territory.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Lithuania incorporated the Memel region (formerly part of East Prussia) in 1923. Lithuania granted some autonomy to Memel on May 7, 1924. Lithuania dismissed the Memel directorate headed by Herbert Boettcher on February 6, 1932. German protested to the *League of Nations* (LON) Council on February 8, 1932. The LON Council referred the matter to the guarantors of the *Memel Convention* (Britain, France, Italy, Japan) on February 20, 1932. The guarantor countries requested an advisory opinion on the dismissal of Herbert Boettcher from the *Permanent Court of International Justice* (PCIJ) on April 11, 1932. The PCIJ decided on August 11, 1932 that the dismissal of Herbert Boettcher was not in violation of the Statute of Memel. Lithuania dismissed the Memel directorate headed by Dr. Schreiber on June 28, 1934, and appointed a new directorate consisting of Lithuanians. Germany referred the matter to the guarantor countries on July 4-5, 1934. Germany and Lithuania agreed to resume diplomatic relations on August 5, 1936. Germany demanded the cession of Memel on March 20, 1939, and Lithuania accepted the ultimatum on March 22, 1939. Germany annexed Memel from Lithuania on March 23, 1939.
