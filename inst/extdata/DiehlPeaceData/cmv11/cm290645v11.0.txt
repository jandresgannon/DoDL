It was instead connected to the US/coalition invasion of Iraq, as Kuwait was friendly with western forces. MARITMID: MID4273 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID4273 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID4273 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4273 from Gibler (2018), this is the leadup and beginning of the US/coalition invasion and occupation of Iraq. The US, UK, France, and other coalition forces (including Poland here) were attempting to coerce Iraq into complying with weapons inspections. Iraq also threatened the planes enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq, who were keeping Iraq from attacking rebel groups within its borders. Coded civil war MID because this involved threats by Iraq to US and UK war planes involved in preventing civil war activity between the regime and rebel groups in Iraq, and Poland is involved because of its role in the coalition forces. CIVWARLINK: MID4273 3 -- not civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID4273 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID4273 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID4273 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID4 2002-2010:MID4273rivalry=290645 nationa=POLAND nationb=IRAQ MID4273 20030319-20030502  revtype1a=POLICY revtype2a=REGIME/GOVERNMENT fatala=. fatalpa=. lhosta=WAR  revtype1b=POLICY revtype2b=NOT APPLICABLE fatalb=> 999 DEATHS fatalpb=. lhostb=WAR Over the course of 2002, US and UK planes bombed various Iraqi defense systems placed either in or near the US-imposed no-fly zones. During this time Iraq deployed ground forces to its border towns in a preemptive move against future US aggression. Beginning in March 2003, the US began deploying additional land, naval, and air forces to the the Middle East in a clear show of force and build-up to a future invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, just prior to the US-led invasion, several Middle Eastern countries deployed small numbers of troops to Kuwait in a symbolic show of defense for the neighbor of Iraq, which had been the historical target of Iraqi aggression. Later in March 2003, a US-led coalition, seeking to oust the regime of Saddam Hussein and dismantle alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, invaded Iraq and engaged in major combat operations, ultimately resulting in war, against the country that lasted until May 1, 2003. First day of dispute was on 3/19/2003 and last day of dispute was on 5/2/2003.NOTE THAT POLAND IS INVOLVED ONLY FOR SHORT TIME, EVEN AS THE DISPUTE BEGAN IN 1997SOURCES: Gibler, D.M. 2018.
