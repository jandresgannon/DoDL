RIVNOTES: 
RIV11117 was originally two separate rivalries (RIV1117 and RIV1118) but these were combined because of the temporal proximity of the disputes in each rivalry (about 15 years) and because the issues in each rivalry (cross-border incursions, support of rebels, etc) were similar across the two rivalries.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1382 from Gibler 2018, domestic unrest in Uganda led to Amin accusing Tanzania, Sudan, and Zambia of preparing to invade Uganda in 1974. Tanzania and Uganda then amassed troops on the border, and Uganda threatened the aforementioned countries with military force should they invade. From New York Times 11/11/1974, part of this unrest was a small group of Ugandan troops that rebelled against the rest of the military and the regime due to a lack of pay and food. The rebellion was quickly put down. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved troops in the military rebelling against the regime; these are organized, militarized rebels in Uganda.

This dispute involves border insecurity on both sides due to the presence of rebel forces operating in the area. On September 28, 1998 Sudan called for a general mobilization against Uganda. Then on October 3, a Sudanese Antonov bomber dropped 9 bombs on two towns in northwestern Uganda, and on the 3rd of November, Sudan fortified its border with Uganda. As a result of the Sudanese buildup on the border Uganda put its troops on alert. Then in April of 1999, Uganda fortified its border with Sudan. First day of dispute was on 9/28/1998 and last day of dispute was on 4/00/1999.

NARRATIVE-CM:
There were ongoing disputes between Uganda and Sudan regarding refugee populations in each country. In May, 1968, Sudanese soldiers entered Uganda and opened fire on a Special Forces' camp. The Sudanese government agreed to pay for compensation for Ugandan losses in the attack. On April 26, 1971, President Amin of Uganda asked the Organization of African Unity to consider action to end the civil war in Sudan. Sudanese troops cross the border into Uganda during a pursuit of rebels on May 15-16, 1971. There was fighting along the border on December 15, 1971 between Sudanese forces and Sudanese rebels based in Uganda. There were a number of attacks of Sudan by Uganda in March, 1975 while the Sudanese president was away on a state visit because President Amin believed that Sudan had entered an alliance against Uganda with Tanzania and Britain. Sudan denied this accusation. Sudan and Uganda agreed to resumed diplomatic relations on December 30, 1979. Sudanese jets were suspected in the bombing of Uganda on November 15, 1989. Uganda and Sudan signed a non-aggression treaty in April, 1990 after each had accused each other of supporting rebel groups in the other's territory. Sudanese and Ugandan representatives signed an agreement in Tripoli, Libya on April 5, 1995, which called for the end of military assistance to rebel groups in both countries. Ugandan rebels attacked targets in Uganda from Sudanese territory on April 20, 1995, resulting in the deaths of some 155 individuals. Uganda severed diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 23, 1995, and expelled eleven Sudanese diplomats from the country on April 24, 1995. Sudanese troops and Ugandan troops clashed near the border on October 29, 1995. Iran attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries beginning in Spetember 1996. Sudanese and Ugandan representatives signed a draft peace agreement in Tehran in November 1996. Jimmy Carter, representing the Carter Center (CC), mediated negotiations between President Omar Bashir of Sudan and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in Nairobi, Kenya. The leaders of Sudan and Uganda signed an eleven-point agreement in Nairobi on December 8, 1999, which provided for the resumption of diplomatic relations and the end to military assistance to rebel groups. Representatives of Sudan and Uganda held Carter Center (CC) facilitated-negotiations in Nairobi on January 19-21, 2001.

NARRATIVE-CR:
There were ongoing disputes between Uganda and Sudan regarding refugee populations in each country in the late 1960s. In May, 1968, Sudanese soldiers entered Uganda and opened fire on a Special Forces' camp. The Sudanese government agreed to pay for compensation for Ugandan losses in the attack. This is designated MID1403.

Sudanese troops cross the border into Uganda during a pursuit of rebels on May 15-16, 1971. This is MID2622.

There was fighting along the border on December 15, 1971 between Sudanese forces and Sudanese rebels based in Uganda. This is MID1404.

There were a number of attacks of Sudan by Uganda in March, 1975 while the Sudanese president was away on a state visit because President Amin believed that Sudan had entered an alliance against Uganda with Tanzania and Britain. Sudan denied this accusation. Sudan and Uganda agreed to resume diplomatic relations on December 30, 1979. 

The second rivalry between Sudan and Uganda deals with each state's support for rebel groups in the other's country. Uganda was supporting the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, or the SPLA, in Sudan. Sudan was supporting rebel groups in Uganda as well, such as the Allied Democratic Forces, or the ADF.

Sudanese jets were suspected in the bombing of Uganda on November 15, 1989. Uganda and Sudan signed a non-aggression treaty in April, 1990 after each had accused each other of supporting rebel groups in the other's territory. This ended MID3912.

MID4078 was a long, three year series of disputes between the two countries that revolved around each state's support of rebel groups. Sudanese forces built up in Southern Sudan in January of 1994 to begin a campaign against SPLA forces and to cut their supply line from Kenya and Uganda. Fighting continued through 1994. Sudanese forces bombed a Ugandan village in February of 1995. Sudanese and Ugandan representatives signed an agreement in Tripoli, Libya on April 5, 1995, which called for the end of military assistance to rebel groups in both countries. Ugandan rebels attacked targets in Uganda from Sudanese territory on April 20, 1995, resulting in the deaths of some 155 individuals. Uganda severed diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 23, 1995, and expelled eleven Sudanese diplomats from the country on April 24, 1995. Sudanese troops and Ugandan troops clashed near the border on October 29, 1995. Sudan accused Ugandan soldiers of fighting along with the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, SPLA, to overthrow the government in November, 1995. Sudanese and Ugandan representatives signed a draft peace agreement in Tehran in November 1996. On January 26, 1997, Sudanese forces attacked a rebel base near the Ugandan border. Ugandan troops attacked the Sudanese towns of Kaya and Bazi on March 10, 1997. Talks between the two countries began on March 14 of that year, but broke down.

In December of 1997, Sudanese-backed rebels in Uganda fought with Ugandan forces. This is MID4304. This coincided with US Secretary of State, Albright's visit to Uganda in which she met with SPLA representatives.

The leaders of Sudan and Uganda signed an eleven-point agreement in Nairobi on December 8, 1999, which provided for the resumption of diplomatic relations and the end to military assistance to rebel groups. 

There were more attacks against the Ugandan government by the Sudanese-backed Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) throughout the early part of 1999. This is MID4248.

Violence has occurred as recently as 2001, MID4305, between these two countries. MID4305 Uganda placed its troops on alert because of rebel activity along the border in Sudan (this all the information COW gives).

Sudan became independent on January 1, 1956. Uganda became independent on October 9, 1962. Given the deterioration of the common market with Kenya and Tanzania, in 1965 Uganda started looking for other markets for trade and Sudan was one of the obvious choices, as its northern neighbor. However, throughout the 1960s the relations between the two countries were heavily strained as Sudan accused Uganda of provide political asylum to rebel groups who wanted the break-up of the Sudanese state, especially of its southern part. Secondly, Sudan accused Uganda of helping the rebel groups with weapons to fight the regime in Khartoum. On July 14, 1965, the government of Sudan charged that foreigners specifically Uganda was helping southern Sudan rebels with weapons. However, no MIDs are reported for this period. The first MID of RIV11117, MID1403 lasted from May 14 to 18, 1968. 

20011030-20030106 Transition

The last MID of RIV11117, MID4305 ended on October 30, 2001. Sudan has permitted Uganda to make limited attacks on the bases of the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) rebels on its territory, local media reported on March 14, 2002. This was a significant turning point in the relationship as Sudan did not allow Uganda to conduct such incursions in its own territory until then. A joint statement issued by Ugandan Foreign Minister James Wapakhabulo and visiting Sudanese Minister of Information and Communications Mahdi Ibrahim Mohammed said the military offensive is a step towards normalizing relations between the two countries. "By virtue of the ongoing arrangements and subsequent contacts and understanding, the government of the Sudan provided access for the friendly Ugandan forces, to execute a limited military operation within the boarders of the Sudan in order to deal with the LRA problems," said the statement. The statement said that it also demonstrates the willingness of both Uganda and the Sudan to fight global terrorism as well as to curb security threats facing the two countries. "In the process of coordinating and implementing the agreed arrangements, both Uganda and the Sudan will spare no efforts in order to safe guard and maintain the safety of innocent civilians, as well," the statement added. Uganda broke diplomatic relations with the Sudan in April 1995, accusing the neighbor of backing the LRA and allowing it to use the Sudan as a springboard for raids into Uganda while the Sudan alleged that Uganda was supporting the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in its effort to set up a greater autonomic Christian southern Sudan. Following a peace accord in Kenya's capital of Nairobi in 1999, both Uganda and the Sudan pledged to stop supporting each other's rebels and exchanged envoys in 2001, restoring diplomatic relations after a six-year break.

The Sudanese Minister of External Relations Dr Mustafa Uthman has condemned Uganda's abnormal stance against the unanimous vote of African countries in support of Sudan at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on April 22, 2002. Undersecretary at the Ministry of External Relations Dr Mutrif Siddiq affirmed that Sudan will take a firm stand on this, especially on issues concerning cooperation with Uganda. Abd-al-Salam al-Mudathir has more on this: Mudathir Sudanese-Ugandan relations have again entered a new dark tunnel following Uganda's vote against Sudan on human rights at the UN. This has made the UN human rights committee adopt EU resolutions against Sudan.

A senior Sudanese presidential aide left for Uganda on November 20, 2002 to discuss the Kampala government's request to renew a security agreement allowing Ugandan troops to pursue rebels from the neighboring country into southern Sudan. Sudan seems likely to grant the request since Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail earlier in November 2002, condemned the Ugandan rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army, as a terrorist organization. A statement carried by the official Sudan News Agency said presidential aide as Mubarak el-Fadel el-Mahdi would discuss "security questions" with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. El-Mahdi, who is of Cabinet rank, is a cousin of the last democratically elected prime minister of Sudan, Sadiq el-Mahdi. He defected from the opposition Umma party and joined the government earlier this year. Uganda has asked Sudan to renew an accord that allows Ugandan troops to cross into southern Sudan in pursuit of armed members of the Lord's Resistance Army. On November 17, 2002, Ismail said the government had asked Uganda to clarify certain points of its request. "If the information is sufficient and convincing, then the agreement shall be renewed," Ismail told parliament. "Any talk of a possible resumption of ties with the Lord's Resistance Army is nil and void. For us, the Lord's Resistance Army is a terrorist organization that has to be chased out of southern Sudan," Ismail said. In the early 1990s, the Sudanese government allowed the Lord's Resistance Army to use southern Sudan as a base to attack in northern Uganda. At the time, Khartoum accused Uganda of hosting the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.

On January 7, 2003, Uganda appointed an ambassador to Sudan, marking the restoration of full diplomatic ties between the neighboring countries. Diplomatic relations were severed in 1995 after both countries accused each other of backing rebel groups hostile to their respective governments. Kampala had accused Khartoum of backing the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a brutal group active in northern Uganda which has rear bases in southern Sudan, while Khartoum accused Kampala of supporting rebels of the SPLA. Sudan on January 9, 2003, urged neighboring Uganda to clamp down on members of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on its territory, and notably to prevent the group from importing arms through Uganda, officials said. The request for tougher measures against the SPLA, which is fighting for self-determination of southern Sudan, was made by a visiting delegation from Khartoum, which was led by Defence Minister General Bakri Hassan Saleh. "The proposal spells out what the true status of the SPLA in Uganda should be," said Mohamed Sirajuddin, Sudan's ambassador to Uganda, explaining the details of a request put to Kampala by the Sudanese delegation. "They (SPLA) should not come into Uganda armed, they should not import arms through Uganda and they should not carry out activities that are injurious to the security of the region," Sirajuddin told reporters at Entebbe airport before the departure of the Sudanese delegation. Earlier, Saleh had a meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in the northern Ugandan town of Gulu. In December 1999, the two countries signed an accord in Nairobi under which they promised to stop backing each other's rebel groups and to work towards resuming diplomatic relations, which were restored at charge d'affairs level in 2001. "We think that Sudan has played its part by implementing its part on the LRA and we think it is now Uganda's turn to implement its part," said Sirajuddin, adding that Khartoum expected Kampala to treat all SPLA members based in Uganda as refugees. Last March, Sudan allowed Uganda to deploy troops in southern Sudan to pursue LRA fighters. A communique signed by Mbabazi and Saleh said that the Sudanese army will take control of former LRA camps in southern Sudan which the rebels abandoned as they fled a Ugandan army offensive in the region last year. The two countries' armies had also agreed on greater coordination in the fight against the LRA, according to the communique.

Trade between Uganda and Sudan is growing in spite of the war of words between them, officials of the Uganda Export Promotion Board (UEPB) said in the end of October 2003. Exports from Uganda to Sudan rose from only $4 million in 1997 to over $5.7 million in 2002. Over the past few months, relations between the two countries have improved, after sinking to their lowest in 1995, leading Uganda to close the Sudanese embassy in Kampala. At the height of animosity between Uganda and Sudan in 1997, the two countries were accusing each other of supporting dissidents against each other. Uganda accused Sudan of supporting the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army, while Khartoum accused Uganda of supporting the Sudanese People's Liberation Army based in southern Sudan. Both countries denied the charges. However, Sudanese President Omar Bashir has visited Kampala thrice in the past 12 months and both countries have reopened their embassies. Sudan has promised to import more agricultural produce, especially coffee and tea. Uganda's exports to Sudan include coffee, tea and foodstuffs. An official of the Uganda Coffee Development Authority said that Sudan was one of the leading importers of Ugandan coffee in Africa, but the political relations between the two countries had affected the growth of trade. The official, who declined to be named, said, "With improved relations between the two countries, exports to Sudan should improve." He said Sudan was importing Ugandan coffee despite the latter country not marketing it in the former. "It would do better if we were to promote it," said the official. Sudan also imports large volumes of tea from Uganda, but the security situation in southern Sudan has hampered the transportation of the commodity, forcing exporters to airfreight their goods, incurring high expenses. The figures released by UEPB last week, however, do not reflect the actual trade, especially in southern Sudan, where most of it is informal. The figures show that outside Europe, Uganda exports more to Kenya than to any other country and that export earnings have been improving over the years. In 1997, for example, the country exported goods worth $17 million to its eastern neighbor, a figure which rose to $61 million last year. However, trade between Uganda and Kenya is 4:1 in favor of the latter. Ugandan exports to Kenya are mostly food items such as maize, beans and bananas.

On July 11, 2005, Uganda has opened a consulate in the southern Sudanese city of Juba to assist Ugandan firms to participate in trade and investment in the country. An official in Uganda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Julius Kagamba, said, "Uganda's foreign policy is currently geared towards trade and investment, so the consulate will help Ugandan companies to sell more goods to Sudan. Uganda was already supplying goods to southern Sudan, he said. The previous week, Mr Kagamba told The EastAfrican that the consulate would also enable Uganda to support the implementation of the Sudan Peace Agreement, being one of the countries given a mandate by the African Union to do so. Arapta Mangusho, who previously worked at the Foreign Ministry's Multilateral Organisations and Treaties Department, will head the Juba consulate. A memorandum of understanding between Uganda and Sudan signed in April 2004 allowed Kampala to open a consulate in Juba, while Khartoum was to set up one in Gulu in northern Uganda. Government officials said the arrangement was aimed at enabling Ugandan firms to compete favorably with business from Kenya and Egypt for business opportunities in Sudan. Uganda has also planned business conferences and trade missions for manufacturers, traders, contractors and government departments. Ugandan authorities and companies are worried that if they do not move quickly, they could lose the anticipated windfall to Egypt-which is already doing roaring trade with Sudan-and Kenya, which is opening a commercial bank and is likely to erect infrastructure at Sudan's Rumbek airstrip. Uganda is currently home to about 240,000 Sudanese refugees, and it is anticipated that when they return home they will form a major basis for growth of trade with Uganda. The UN says it will use Entebbe airport for most of its relief operations in southern Sudan, as it already does for its eastern Congo mission. During an investment and trade conference for Sudan held on June 7 in Kampala, Janet Namuyangu, Minister of State for Industry, said Uganda needed to devise a strategy for entering the Sudan market, bearing in mind udgetary and funding implications and other logistics. "It is also important to establish a sustainable and entrenched trade platform in Sudan by opening up permanent trade and exhibition points for continued business promotion and creation of strategic business linkages," she said. Sembule Steel Mills, one of Uganda's big companies, says it has sent a team to Sudan to do a market survey for its products, which include barbed wire, chain link, wire mesh, roofing sheets and mild steel plates. Roofings Ltd, a leading manufacturer of building materials, which last year earned $ 10 million from exports to Burundi, Congo, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania, says it is anticipating higher export earnings from Sudan, with the new political dispensation and planned erection of communication infrastructure between the two countries. When he toured the Sembule mill last week, Trade and Industry Minister Daudi Migereko said Uganda had paid a heavy price for its involvement in the Sudan conflict and stood to gain by doing business with Sudan. On June 8, President Yoweri Museveni said Ugandan firms were playing a major role in rehabilitating southern Sudan. Uganda was training a contingent of its soldiers to be part of the UN peacekeeping force in Sudan and Uganda was training 250 Sudanese police officers. Ignie Igundura, public relations manager of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, says resumption of Entebbe-Khartoum flights two months ago-after a 10-year hiatus-is boosting trade and tourism between the two countries. While passengers from Entebbe to Khartoum had to fly Kenya Airways through Nairobi, now they can fly straight to Sudan. Air Sudan operates a weekly direct flight from Entebbe to Juba and Khartoum. Uganda is keen to establish a rail link from Gulu to Sudan's Nimule and Juba, and from Pakwach to Sudan's Wau and Yei towns. Kawaga Zalwango, spokesperson of Uganda Railways Corporation, said the line to Gulu had already been rehabilitated while work is going on on the Pakwach line. Meanwhile, Ugandan and Kenyan investors attending a southern Sudan investors' conference in Kampala last month said much needs to be done before they move there. The investors said Sudanese authorities have to create a modern legal system to run alongside the traditional one and set up a data system that enables investors to make informed decisions. They also asked the Sudanese delegation, which was led by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM/A), vice chairman Dr Riek Machar, to formulate modern traffic rules. Currently, for example, if a foreigner knocks down a Sudanese national, he has to compensate the family of the deceased with 52 cattle. "We need to respond to the opportunities that will accrue from the peace agreement reached between the SPLM/A and Khartoum, but we need a good environment," said Florence Kata, executive director of the Uganda Export Promotion Board. The meeting also asked Sudan to address the internal contradictions such as the inconsistencies in levying taxes by various local governments. "Though Uganda and southern Sudan have been trading informally and co-operating for the past 23 years, we need to formalize the cross-border trade as we share cultures and common languages," Ms Kata said. The two-day conference running from June 22-23 was organized by Knight and Day Consortium in collaboration with Resource Team Uganda Ltd and attracted over 140 potential investors and exhibitors from as far as Kuwait, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The investors were told that they could tap into the $ 4.2 billion Multi-Donor Trust Fund for South and North Sudan that will become operational in six to 12 months. For example, the UN peacekeeping mission for the Sudan will need 10,000 peacekeepers for six years, who will need housing and related services. USAID is to run a $ 400 million project to refurbish and build new infrastructure, while GTZ will look at roads and water dykes, all offering big contracts for construction companies in the region.

Uganda ordered a temporary closure of its border with Sudan after unknown assailants killed 38 people the week of October 16, 2006, on roads leading to the main southern Sudanese town of Juba. The measure has been taken for the safety of people who use the road to Juba, and Ugandan army units near the border are on high alert, army spokesman Maj. Felix Kulayigye said. He said the border would be reopened when the security situation improved. "We have stopped vehicles moving to Sudan. We are not allowing them to cross to Sudan for their own security," Kulayigye said. "Our soldiers are on high alert. They are ready for any eventuality. They are at the border of Uganda and Southern Sudan." On October 20, 2006, the U.N. refugee agency said that it had suspended its operation helping Sudanese refugees return from Uganda, following last year's peace deal that ended two decades of civil war in the southern Sudan. The agency took the action after reports of at least 38 civilians killed in attacks in southern Sudan by unknown assailants, said Ron Redmond, spokesman for U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. Kulayigye said that it was the Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army rebel group that carried out the attacks. Lord's Resistance Army spokesman Godfrey Ayo denied the rebel group carried out the attack, saying they had checked with their fighters in southern Sudan who said they were not responsible. Hundreds of passengers scheduled to travel to southern Sudan are stranded at the border. Six buses, several taxis and trucks are at the border waiting to be allowed to travel to Juba, Sudanese businessman Tolbert Tabani told The Associated Press on the phone from the border town of Nimule. Tabani, whose truck is among those waiting to be allowed to go to Juba, said that the border closure would affect business in southern Sudan, which relies on trade with Uganda for most of its supplies. "There has been good business atmosphere in Juba but now things have changed for the worse. I hope the situation improves," Tabani said.

Even though the relationship is still tense with rebel groups on both sides of the border, the central governments of Kampala and Khartoum seem to have reached an agreement to work together against the rebel groups. The fact that they re-established diplomatic relations in 2003, after eight years, and the range of security and trade agreements signed signal an improvement in the relationship.
