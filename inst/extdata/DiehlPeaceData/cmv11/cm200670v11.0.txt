NARRATIVE-CM:
Britain and Saudi Arabia disputed the territorial border between Saudi Arabia and the British protectorates in the Arabian Peninsula on April 26, 1949, when Saudi Arabia protested British interference with Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO) personnel in the border region. Britain rejected the Saudi Arabian protest on May 11, 1949. On May 21, 1950, Saudi Arabia lodged a protest against oil exploration by the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company* near islands claimed by Saudi Arabia. British and Saudi Arabian representatives held negotiations in Dammam, Saudi Arabia between January 28 and February 14, 1952. Turki ibn Abdullah, a Saudi Arabian government official, and 40 Saudi Arabians took control of the Buraimi Oasis on August 31, 1952. Britain protested against the Saudi Arabian occupation of the al-Buraimi region, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the Saudi Arabian personnel from the region on September 14, 1952. Saudi Arabia rejected the protest on September 17, 1952. The United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia offered to mediate negotiations between the countries on October 10, 1952, and the US ambassador mediated an agreement between the parties on October 26, 1952. The agreement provided for a prohibition against reinforcing troops currently in the region and a resumption of negotiations. Britain proposed that the dispute be submitted to arbitration on November 22, 1952, but Saudi Arabia rejected the proposal on December 6, 1952. King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia suggested that he would consider submitted the al-Buraimi dispute to arbitration on April 20, 1953. British and Saudi Arabian representatives signed an arbitration agreement in Jeddah on July 30, 1954, which provided for the establishment of a five-member arbitration tribunal. Saudi troops withdrew from the Buraimi Oasis on August 13, 1954 as required by the arbitration agreement. The arbitration tribunal (Belgium, Britain, Cuba, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia) headed by Charles de Visscher of Belgium convened in Geneva on September 11, 1955, but Britain withdrew its representative from the tribunal on September 16, 1955. British-commanded troops (Trucial Oman Scouts) seized control of the al-Buraimi region on October 26, 1955, resulting in the deaths of two British-commanded soldiers. Saudi Arabia referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council, and severed diplomatic relations with Britain on October 30, 1955. The *League of Arab *States (LAS) appealed for the withdrawal of British troops from the al-Buraimi region on November 16, 1955. UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold attempted to mediate negotiations between the parties from September 1959 to August 1960. On August 12, 1960, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjold appointed Herbert de Ribbing of Sweden to conduct a fact-finding mission to the region. Britain and Saudi Arabia agreed to resume diplomatic relations on January 16, 1963.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The two rivalries between the UK and Saudi Arabia revolve around British influence in the region. Despite the fact that the Saudis sought British military support in the interim period - 1934 to 1955 - they engaged in hostility associated with the Yemen

In 1926 Abdul Aziz ibn Saud established a protectorate of the province of Asir. This brought Saudi presence to the region inhabited by Yemenis. This resulted in friction and border clashes. In 1932, Imam Yahya's (Yemeni) forces occupied the border oasis of Najran but were expelled by Saudi forces. For the next two years, the Saudis and the Yemenis fruitlessly tried to negotiate the border. In April of 1934, Saudi forces attacked Yemeni positions. The Saudis had mixed success on the battlefield and the Yemenis called for outside assistance. The Italians, British and French all sent warships to deter Saudi presence to colonial possessions. Abd al Aziz was deterred and settled the affair with the treaty of Taif. He withdrew from Yemen in exchange for Yemeni recognition of Saudi sovereignty of Asir province (a border region). This series of events includes MID1129. After the brief war the border with Saudi Arabia was settled by treaty that was mediated by Great Britain. 

After the clash with Yemen in the early 1930s and the discovery of oil, the Saudi king recognized the need for a standing army and sought assistance from Britain, Egypt, and the United States. By the mid-1940s, the Saudis were relying more on the United States than on any other country, mostly because of the successful relations between Saudi officials and Aramco.

MID3218 occurred in November of 1955 and MID2844 occurred in February of 1956. Both of these events occurred as a part of the larger crisis called the Buraymi oasis crisis. In this crisis the issue is again one of British influence in the region. When the Arabian Peninsula was divided up after World War I some of the borders were indistinct including those between Oman and Saudi Arabia. In the late 1940s, Omani engineers began exploring in the Burayami oasis area. In response the Saudis claimed sovereignty over the area. The United Kingdom claimed Oman as a dependent territory at the time and thus represented Oman in dealing with Saudi Arabia in this dispute. The two states attempted negotiations to demarcate the border but failed. In 1952, Saudi Arabi sent a small force to the region to attempt to forcibly assert sovereignty over the region. The UK responded with threats of its own saying it reserved the right of freedom of movement in the area. The UK then blockaded the area. The UK then forcibly occupied the Buraymi oasis resulting in fatalities. 

The end of the rivalry between the UK and Saudi Arabia coincides with British withdrawal from the country. In the early 1960s, the Gulf States experienced a growth in oil revenues. A new sense of identity also appeared in gulf sheikhdoms and aroused a growing expectation that they should rule themselves. To do this, sheikhs had to cut themselves off from British control and protection

By the early 1960s, this was something to which the British had little objection. India and Pakistan won their independence in 1947; this meant that Britain no longer had to worry about protecting the western flank of the subcontinent. Britain was also burdened by the tremendous sacrifices it made during World War II and could not be as globally involved as it had been before the war. Therefore, Britain yielded many of its strategic responsibilities to the United States in the postwar period or gave them up entirely. However, the British were bound to the gulf by treaties and so remained in the region, but it was clear by the 1960s that they sought to leave the gulf. 

British action forced gulf leaders to decide. Because of domestic financial concerns, Britain decided in the late 1960s to eliminate its military commitments east of Suez. As a result, the gulf sheikhs held a number of meetings to discuss independence. The ultimate result of these events ended in British withdrawal from the area and the undermining of further motivation for the continuation of hostilities between the UK and Saudi Arabia.
