CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1203 from cm002093v11.0 narrative, throughout the 20th century, the US policy in Nicaragua was to influence the tide of civil wars by assisting rebels when a rebel victory would result in a US-friendly regime, or to assist a friendly government against rebel forces. MID1203 occurred in 1909 and involved the US assisting the rebels against President Jose Zelaya. The NYT reported on 3/15/1909 that Mexico voiced its support for US intervention and dispatched a gunboat to Nicaraguan waters, pulling Mexico into this MID. Coded civil war MID because Mexico helped the US intervene in the Nicaraguan civil war against the government, triggering this MID.
