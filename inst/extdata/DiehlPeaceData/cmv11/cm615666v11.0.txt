CIVWARMID-CER: MID1069 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1069 from Gibler 2018, in 1968 Palestinian terrorists/rebels hijacked an Israeli airliner, and the plane was forced to land in Algeria. Algeria released most of the passengers but detained the Israeli ones while negotiations between Israel and the terrorists continued. The hostages were eventually released. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity occurring within this dyad (Algeria). Algeria is pulled into this MID against Israel because they helped the terrorists during the negotiations by detaining Israeli passengers.

CIVWARMID: MID1068 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1068 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1068 from Gibler 2018, in 1970 a British passenger plane carrying two Algerian officials landed in Israel, and Israel detained the Algerians. Israel claimed Algeria was at war with Israel, due to Algeria's seizing of Israeli passengers when an airliner was hijacked by Palestinian terrorists two years earlier. Coded civil war MID because Israel was retaliating for Algeria's actions involving terrorists targeting Israel within Algeria (within this dyad) two years earlier, although there was no rebel/terrorist activity occurring at the time of this MID.
