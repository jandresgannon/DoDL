TERRLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Yugoslavia thought the Yugoslavian states should not have their own boundaries independent of a Yugoslavian state. They therefore refused to recognize the independence of states that declared independence from Yugoslavia, still claiming their territory as part of Yugoslavia. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Netherlands (as part of UN/NATO) became involved in this MID, which is territorial, civil war, and civil war link. See CIVWARMID and CIVWARLINK.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/independence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerrillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia, armed the villagers, and the newly armed villagers violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99.

MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

After World War II, the two countries which technically were part of the same anti-German coalition with UK, US and Russia, maintained diplomatic relations established in 1899 and cooperation in certain areas. There were not many areas of disagreement, nor were there numerous issues of intense cooperation.

A preliminary trade agreement between Netherlands and Yugoslavia was worked out on August 15, 1947. It covers the exchange of Netherland freighters and harbor cranes for Yugoslav lead, timber and other raw materials.

An agreement on air services between Netherlands and Yugoslavia was signed on March 13, 1957. An agreement on Cultural Cooperation was signed between the two countries on August 11, 1966. An agreement on international road transportation between them was signed on September 8, 1966. On February 16, 1976, an agreement on the protection of investments between the two governments was signed and on February 22, 1982 a treaty on the avoidance of double taxation in respect of income and capital was signed.

On April 27, 1979, the Dutch Foreign Minister made an official visit to Yugoslavia. Friendly relations between Yugoslavia and the Netherlands are developing successfully and the two countries are prepared to intensify co-operation in all fields. This is set out in the communique on Dutch Foreign Minister Christoph van der Klaauw's visit to Yugoslavia. The Foreign Ministers of Yugoslavia and of the Netherlands agreed to examine ways for further expanding economic co-operation on an equal basis and in the interests of both sides. In their discussion of relations between Yugoslavia and the European Economic Community, Ministers Vrhovec and van der Klaauw emphasized their wish for the new agreement between Yugoslavia and the European Community to lead to more balanced economic relations, in the interests of both sides. The two ministers further emphasized their wish that account be taken in the negotiations of the principles (?enjoined) in the declaration of 2nd December, 1976, adopted at a time when the Community chairmanship was held by the Netherlands. The two ministers also focused in their talks on international subjects, including detente, European security and co-operation, the implementation of the final document of the Helsinki Conference and preparations for the meeting in Madrid of the European Security and Co-operation Conference, disarmament, the role of the United Nations, the situation in the Middle East and Africa and the establishment of the new international economic order. The Yugoslav Federal Secretary informed the Dutch Minister of the activities of non-aligned countries and emphasized the importance of the policy of non-alignment in international affairs. The two ministers voiced satisfaction with the results of the talks, in which a great closeness of views was expressed in regard to a large number of questions discussed. The Dutch Foreign Minister invited the Yugoslav Foreign Affairs Secretary to pay an official visit to the Netherlands. The invitation was accepted with pleasure. The date of the visit will be fixed subsequently.

Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, accompanied by his wife and associates, arrived on an official visit to Yugoslavia on 24th April, 1984. He was greeted at Belgrade Airport by Premier Milka Planinc, Foreign Minister Lazar Mojsov, Serbian Premier Branislav Ikonic, and other officials. Premier Lubbers was accompanied by Foreign Minister Hans van der Broek.

The two Premiers began talks in the same afternoon. They took place in the cordial and friendly atmosphere characteristic of the good relations between the SFRY and the Netherlands, their understanding and co-operation. Greatest attention was devoted to the two countries' economic problems. Both sides concurred that aid to developing countries should be increased so that they could strengthen their economies and thus be able to repay the debts taken on for their own development. The two heads of government expressed satisfaction with the development of economic relations between the SFRY and the Netherlands, although they said that not all the possibilities had as yet been exploited, particularly with regard to production co-operation, joint investment and co-operation on third markets. Premier Lubbers announced that an economic delegation from the Netherlands would shortly arrive in Yugoslavia for talks on specific possibilities for expanding co-operation. Yugoslavia's relations with the EEC was also a topic of discussion. The Yugoslav side expressed satisfaction with the Netherlands' role in stimulating this co-operation. Turning to the inter-national situation, Planinc and Lubbers expressed concern that the increased confrontation of the great powers posed threat to the course of international co-operation, peace and security, and came out firmly in favor of a return to a policy of detente on the world scene; they indicated that responsibility for creating conditions for such a return lay with the superpowers.

On the following day, Premier Lubbers was received by Mika Spiljak, President of the SFRY Presidency, for talks on bilateral co-operation and ways of improving the present serious situation in the world. During the talks it was noted that broad opportunities existed for promoting even further the already existing good bilateral co-operation, particularly in the economic sphere and also at the international level, especially within the framework of international economic and financial institutions. When dealing with the world situation, President Spiljak and Premier Lubbers agreed on the need to make additional efforts to renew the North-South dialogue. Taking part in the talks on the Yugoslav side were: Milka Planinc; Lazar Mojsov and the Yugoslav Ambassador to the Netherlands, Dragoljub Petrovic. After the talks, President Spiljak gave a luncheon in honour of Premier Lubbers. In the afternoon, the visitors left for Macedonia.

Raif Dizdarevic, SFRY Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Rotterdam on 3rd June, 1986 and was met at the airport by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek. Later that day talks were held in the Hague with van den Broek. Both sides assessed bilateral relations in very positive terms and shared an interest in their promotion. They stated their readiness to stimulate and support co-operation between Yugoslav and Dutch firms. Dizdarevic expressed Yugoslavia's concern over the recent EEC ban on imports of Yugoslavian agricultural produce, and stressed Yugoslavia's interest in obtaining compensation for the 25,000,000 dollars' worth of immediate damage and also the direct damage caused to the economy. In connection with this, Yugoslavia expected a considerable improvement in the EEC's mandate instructions for the forthcoming negotiations on new trade regulations in the agreement on Yugoslav-EEC co-operation and the second protocol of the agreement. It was also emphasised that negotiations needed to be completed as soon as possible. Both sides referred to the interest sh own by Yugoslav firms in participating in part of the Eureka programme, and there was extensive discussion on the course of negotiations within the CSCE. The talks were attended on the Yugoslav side by Dusan Strbac, Assistant Federal Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Dragomir Vucicevic, head of the West European department in the Federal Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, and Drago Trbojevic, advisor in the Federal Secretary's bureau; and on the Dutch side by Baron van Aerssen Beijeren van Voshol, head of the East European Bureau.

On 4th June Dizdarevic had talks with Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, who stressed that the Netherlands attached great significance to relations with Yugoslavia. In a comprehensive exchange of views Lubbers said that this country was interested in close co-operation and dialogue with Yugoslavia in the context of East-West detente. Dizdarevic stressed that efforts should be made to regulate future relations with the EEC and possibilities for increasing business arrangements, exports and the total volume of economic exchange should be sought. The meeting was held in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere and lasted longer than envisaged by protocol. Afterwards Dizdarevic held talks in a cordial and friendly atmosphere with the Dutch Head of State, Queen Beatrix. Later that day Dizdarevic left the Netherlands for Belgrade.

Yugosla President Branko Mikulic arrived in the Hague on 6th December, 1988 for an official visit to the Netherlands. Immediately after the arrival ceremonies, he and his host, Premier Lubbers, were received by Queen Beatrix. Following a meeting with the President of the Senate, Dr Steenkamp, the two Premiers began their talks, at first privately and then with the full delegations, when the Dutch side included the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and Trade. The Yugoslav President briefed his hosts on his country's determination to pursue its reform policies and the hosts accepted with approval Yugoslavia's wish to continue to develop its relations with the EEC and the Netherlands on the basis of its independent and non-aligned policies. While the 19% increase in exports from the SFRY to the Netherlands in the first ten months of this year was regarded as a positive sign, it should not be forgotten that Yugoslavia's accumulated deficit over the last seven years is more than 500m dollars.

On September 24, 1991, the Netherlands called on the U.N. Security Council to impose an arms embargo on Yugoslavia. Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, hans van den broek, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, said, "a mandatory arms embargo by the Security Council under chapter VII (of the U.N. Charter) is needed to bring peace in this region," given the continuous breaches of several cease-fire agreements brokered by the European Communities (EC). Expressing the conviction that the peaceful settlement of the Yugoslav question will have positive bearing on potential conflicts elsewhere, van den Broek, who spoke also on behalf of the EC, said the EC and its member states will persevere in their efforts of mediation. The foreign minister called upon all leaders, parties and all people in Yugoslavia to end the violence and cooperate with the EC in order to make the Yugoslavia conference under EC auspices a success for the sake of all people in Yugoslavia and for peace and stability in Europe. Fighting has been going on in Yugoslavia since June 1991 betweeen Croatians who declared independence and the federal army and Serbians, an ethnic minority who oppose Croatia's independence. the U.N. Security Council is expected to consider the Yugoslavia question this week, including the possibility of imposing an arms embargo under chapter VII of the charter, which authorizes the council to take necessary measures to counter any threat to peace. In his speech, the minister also called for the development of new ways of thinking, saying common responsibility in today's world requires more than improving old structures, institutions and habits. More responsible behavior between states is needed and its first rule is the ban on the threat or use of force, he said. He noted that "both national and international security require more than just refraining from aggression." "Security is enhanced by the breaking down of barriers of distrust, by the promotion of commerce, contacts and communication, by the free flow of people, values and ideas, by opening up our societies." In order to solve an increasing number of global problems or even threat to mankind, he said, greater responsibility should also be assumed, notably in the fields of development and environment.

The last MID of RIV493, MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

The post-Kosovo period in the relations between Netherlands and Yugoslavia was marked by the Dutch government's desire to see more cooperation from the Serbian side with regard to the war criminals sought by the International Tribunal from Hague. However, with Slobodan Milosevic handed to the Hague Tribunal, the relations kept improving, without any serious threat of Dutch troops being involved in fights against Serbian troops, except specific cases in Kosovo.

The negotiations concerning the succession of bilateral treaties signed between Yugoslavia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands were concluded by the signing of the Agreement on the Consolidation of the Status of Agreements with the Netherlands. By exchange of Notes in July 2001 agreement has been reached for the Convention on the Avoidance of Double Taxation of 1982 to continue in force. During the visit of the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, G. Svilanovic, to the Netherlands on January 29, 2002, the Agreement on the Promotion and Protection of Investments between the two countries was signed. The Agreement on Readmission between the Benelux countries and Yugoslavia was signed in Belgrade on 19 July 2002.

Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on March 25, 2002, urged Yugoslavia's leaders to speed up democratic reforms and improve cooperation with the Netherlands-based U.N. war crimes tribunal. By joining the European mainstream after years of international pariah status under former President Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia has every chance of "carving out a just, stable and peaceful future," Kok said. Kok, head of the government in the Netherlands for eight years, said Yugoslavia faces "many obstacles" and needs to work "faster, closer and stronger" with The Hague court and implement democratic reforms. Kok met with Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, Prime Minister Dragisa Pesic and Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of Serbia, which is the country's dominant republic. He planned to meet with Montenegro's President Milo Djukanovic the same day. Kok told reporters after the talks that he wanted his visit to Belgrade to reflect his country's "interest in the events in Yugoslavia." "Europe and the world are seeking stability in Yugoslavia and the region, stability that should build a future on positive energy, not the use of weapons," Kok said. Kok is the most senior Dutch official to visit since the new democratic authorities replaced Milosevic and his autocratic regime in 2000. Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen came first, in March 2001. Relations between the two countries were continuously troubled by Yugoslavia's lack of cooperation with the tribunal. Milosevic was extradited in 2001 and is on trial at The Hague on charges of war crimes and genocide committed during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. However, scores of others indicted by the tribunal still live or hide inside Serbia. Kok was due Tuesday to visit Kosovo, the southern Serbian province run by NATO troops and a U.N. mission, for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders. On January 29, 2002, the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, G. Svilanovic, paid a return official visit to the Netherlands. On March 25, 2002-The Dutch Prime Minister, W. Kocke, paid a working visit to Yugoslavia. Between April 15-18, 2002, the Federal Vice-Premier and Federal Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, M. Labus, paid a visit to the Netherlands, heading a government and trade delegation. On September 12, 2002, the Federal Foreign Minister G.Svilanovic met with Dutch Foreign Minister J.H.de Scheffer in New York. On December 6-7, 2002, the Federal Foreign Minister G.
