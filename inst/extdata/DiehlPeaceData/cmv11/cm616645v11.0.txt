TERRLINK: MID122 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID122 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID122 from Gibler 2018, in 1961 the Prime Minister of Iraq threatened to annex the newly independent Kuwait, claiming Kuwait was rightfully part of Iraq's territory. The Arab League admitted Kuwait as a member and began assembling a coalition to protect Kuwait from Iraq. Tunisia was a member of the coalition that issued a threat to Iraq to deter Iraq from attacking Kuwait. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait. 

MARITMID: MID122 3 -- not maritime 
MARITMID-CER: MID122 1 -- certain
