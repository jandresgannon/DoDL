TERRLINK: MID3957 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID3957 3 -- uncertain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3957 from Gibler (2018), this is the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. France, as part of a coalition, expelled Iraq from Kuwait. Coded third party link to territorial dispute because the Gulf War was a territorial dispute between Iraq and Kuwait, and France became involved to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2017 does not list Jordan as a participant in this dispute, and Jordan did not participate in the military action or support either side.
