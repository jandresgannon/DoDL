CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1430 from Gibler 2018 and NYT 10/11/1975, a Mozambique soldier killed a Rhodesian citizen, and Rhodesia responded by killing a Mozambique soldier. Tensions between the countries escalated. According to the NYT, a guerrilla war was ongoing in Rhodesia at the time, and Mozambique had ``often declared [its] support [f]or African insurgents seeking black majority rule in Rhodesia.'' Coded civil war MID because the events of this MID connect with civil conflict in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe.

Around the same time, Zambia perceived that rebels in Rhodesia were about to launch an attack on Zambia, so Zambia declared war on Rhodesia. There is no indication, however, that civil conflict extended into Zambia at the time.
