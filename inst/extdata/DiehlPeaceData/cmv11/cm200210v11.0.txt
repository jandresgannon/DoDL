NARRATIVE-CR:
The Habsburg Empire ended its rule of Spain in 1713, when the War of Spanish Succession ended. The Austrian branch of the empire subsequently recovered control of Belgium and provided the region with a rare experience of autonomy-allowing local institutions to operate freely and permitting provincial assemblies to control taxation. The religious and other conflicts of the previous 150 years had undermined Belgium's economic development, and the new freedom enabled the economy to flourish once more. The period of calm lasted only until 1794, when France annexed the country. 

France, which subsequently tried to impose its language throughout the area, only remained in control until 1815, when Napoleon I was defeated. The Congress of Vienna, held in the same year, made Belgium a part of the Netherlands in an effort to check French expansionism. The Peace of Paris was signed on 30 May 1814, which settled territorial issues left after Napoleon's defeat by settling the territorial issues that remained between the Netherlands and Prussia. The Prussian occupation of 1814 was ended, and the Belgians, who "were notoriously incapable of organizing, ruling, and defending themselves (Schroeder 561)" were incorporated into the basic structure of the United Netherlands as a bulwark against France (Schroeder 509, 560-1). 

The region was renamed the South Netherlands. Although Belgium began to prosper and develop once again, the move was ill-fated because of differences in language and religion, and also because Dutch King William's government did not pay adequate attention to Belgian interests. In particular, the barrier between the French speaking Belgians and the Dutch Belgians was too great to be overcome by the House of Orange. Led primarily by residents of the country's French-speaking south in response to an economic downturn, a revolt began in 26 August 1830. Schroeder also traces the revolt to the attempts by William I, King of the United Netherlands, to establish the United Netherlands as a great power in the region. These ambitions, it is argued, fueled the unrest that was to follow for the next eight years. 

In early September, William invited UK, Austria, Prussia, and Russia to advise him about the demands made by the Belgians. Once William determined that he had little outside support, he sent his son and 14000 troops to end the Belgian bid for independence. By 27 September 1830, Dutch forces were compelled to retreat, and William asked for outside assistance.

Within Belgium, on 26 September 1830 a provisional government was established. This government summoned a national congress to draw up a constitution on 4 October 1830. This declaration of independence, combined with William's plea caused other states in Europe to intervene.

The 4 November 1830 London Conference was an attempt by other European states to settle the issue. This conference lasted for several months and offered several proposals which were designed to allow for the establishment of an independent Belgium which were acceptable to both the Belgians and the Netherlands. After it is evident that there is no simple resolution to the impasse, France and the United Kingdom take the lead in 20 December 1830 by declaring the dissolution of The United Netherlands and thus essentially recognizing the independence of Belgium. This was followed by a proposal to settle the dispute on 20 and again 27 Jan 1931. The Dutch accepted, but the Belgians rejected these two peace initiatives.

By summer 1831, the Belgian government began to take shape. On 4 June 1831, the Belgians elect as their king Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. Leopold is chosen after the initial candidate, which was preferred by the Belgians was effectively vetoed by France following a protest by the United Kingdom on 5 February 1831 [MID501]. The Duke of Nemours rejected his election by the Belgian national congress due to pressure from Louis Phillipe (King of France). France believed that a Belgian king that was too close to France would cause other states to resist violently, thus they pressured the Belgians to choose a non-French king. Although Leopold was not French, he was to marry a French princess to maintain ties with the French and satisfy the Belgians. 

The election of Leopold was followed by another attempt to settle the issue, which again came from the London conference. On 26 June 1831 The Eighteen Articles were drawn up in London to settle the issue. This settlement ceeded more to the Belgians, who accepted, but now the King of Holland, William, rejected the proposed agreement. 

In an attempt to force the issue, on 2 August 1831 William sent Dutch troops into Belgium. The Belgian resistance is defeated, but Wiliam was forced to withdraw by a French army that was determined to protect Belgian independence from Holland, but not necessarily from France. The French entered on 11 August at Leopold's request. The United Kingdom initially supported the French movement as the British desired an independent Belgium (independent from the Netherlands and the French). However once the French were in Belgium it was difficult for the UK to ensure their eventual departure. This led to British involvement, retreat (between 15-17 August 1831) and re-involvement in the dispute [MID25].

Diplomatic progress was made in the next series of proposals from the London Conference which were presented on 14 October 1831. The Twenty Four Articles revised the agreement to be more favorable to Holland, but still William refused to sign the agreement. In the face of Dutch intransigence, on 15 November, the United Kingdom and France signed a treaty with Belgium based on the Twenty Four Articles, lending de facto support to the claim of Belgian independence, which had begun with the dissolution of the United Netherlands. This action by France and the United Kingdom was not popular among the more conservative great powers (Russia, Austria, and Prussia), who saw this as appeasement towards revolutionaries. However, this disagreement was not enough to overcome the geographical advantage that the British and French enjoyed in Belgium. As long as Belgium was not annexed by France, the desires of the French and British would win the day. Following the French and British treaty with Belgium, William signs an armistice based on the status quo with Belgium on 21 May 1831. 

The armistice does not lead to a full settlement of the issue. "In late summer 1832, the two Western powers decided that William had to be coerced" (Schroeder 689). The British blockaded the Scheldt River in November of 1832, as the French army beseiged Antwerp (690). [MID368] Austria also threw its weight into an attempt to settle the issue by convincing William to accept the Twenty Four Articles, but again the effort was not sufficient. 

Finally, seven years later, on 19 April 1839 William accepts an agreement which in substance is similar to the Twenty Four points. The Dutch were successful in getting some territorial concessions in Luxemborg and Limburg, which were divided among Holland and Belgium. Perhaps the largest winner in the struggle was the United Kingdom, which benefited from the Scheldt River being declared open to commerce. The signing of the agreement recognized Belgium's independence with Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg as its king and assured its independence with a great power guarantee.

The series of MIDs occurring in the 20th century correspond to the Dutch involvement in the First World War as a neutral nation that was accused of being pro-German in its economic policies. The final conflict that occurred in the series is coded as MID1776 and is untitled. Prime minister Cort van der Linden and Foreign Minister John Loudon were the primary policy makers for the Netherlands and David Lloyd George was in charge of British policy (Roberts 1999). The MID series is coded as starting in August of 1914, MID1654, which corresponds to the initiation of the British inspection of Dutch ships for goods that might be destined for German consumption. The ending date is coded as October of 1917, which corresponds to the submission of the Netherlands to a British and American embargo that required a large cut on exports to Germany (Chickering and Forster 2000).

Beginning in 1914, Great Britain began to accuse the Netherlands as having a pro-German economic disposition and in order to maintain their claim of neutrality would have to submit to inspection of trade ships. In addition to asserting British control over Dutch trade, Britain also mined the waters, which limited port access for Dutch traders (Chickering and Forster 2000). The Netherlands was highly dependent on British raw material imports and entered into short-supply once the ports were blocked. In response the Dutch turned inward to a more pro-German export policy to gain access to new sources of coal (Chickering and Forster 2000). However, this was the opposite of the desired outcome for the British and angered them further. In response the British in conjunction with the Dutch foreign minister formed the Netherlands Overseas Trust Company (NOT), which was supposed to regulate trade and ensure that imports were destined for domestic consumption (Chickering and Forster 2000). 

The NOT was not efficient in preventing Dutch imports from being exported to Germany and by fall of 1915 over half of German agricultural goods were imported from the Netherlands (Chickering and Forster 2000). Britain responded in July of 1916 by imposing a blockade that was set on reducing Dutch-German trade by as much as 50%. Germany responded by launching unrestricted sub-warfare on Dutch waters as well as amassing forces on the German-Netherlands borders (Chickering and Forster 2000). By February of 1917 Britain ceased all ships from entering Dutch ports. In April the US entered the war and joined Britain in the blockade. This double blockade forced the Netherlands into negotiations with both the British-US representatives and the German representatives, although no compromise could be reached. Britain then requisitioned 130 Dutch ships that were in American and British ports (Chickering and Forster 2000). On the German side no agreement could be reached but Wilhelm II ensured the Dutch that their state of neutrality would not be compromised. Following this point the Netherlands played no significant role in the events of WWI and since the Netherlands was considered neutral for the duration of events no treaty was needed.
