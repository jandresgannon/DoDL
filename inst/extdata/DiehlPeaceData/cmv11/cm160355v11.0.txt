MARITMID-NOTES: MID3123 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-36), Argentina's navy fired on 2 Bulgarian fishing vessels. The authors recommend this case be dropped due to lack of evidence that Bulgaria protested this action. Coded not maritime because the boundary was not disputed, and uncertain because GLM suggest this is not a MID.
