MARITMID-CER: MID3610 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3610 from Schultz data, this MID is centered on dispute over Natuna Islands in South China Sea. Considered a maritime dispute as well as an islands dispute because the maritime boundaries in the South China Sea are disputed as well. The islands in the South China sea are mostly uninhabitable, but countries claim ownership of them to advance a legal claim of an EEZ around the islands, so the islands disputes in the South China Sea are also maritime disputes.
