TERRMID-NOTES: MID21 from Gibler (2018), Austria did not want Serbia (Yugoslavia) to have access to the Adriatic via a port in Albania that Austria controlled. Russia supported Serbia's access, and Austria and Serbia mobilized troops over this issue. Russia eventually backed down. Coded somewhat connected to territory because Serbia and Russia were not disputing Austria's sovereignty over the port, but they were asserting that Serbia should have the right to travel through Austria's territory to access the Adriatic Sea.

TERRMID-CER: MID3 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3 from Gibler (2018), after the First Balkan War, Austria-Hungary controlled Albania and sought to claim more of the surrounding territory from Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia wanted to prevent Austrian expansion. Montenegro (Yugoslavia) occupied the Albanian town of Scutari, and Austria mobilized in response. Most Yugoslavian states backed down, but Serbia refused to, although they were eventually forced to back down and accept Austrian expansion. Coded territorial MID because this is connected to Austria claiming and annexing more territory in Albania.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Austria and Yugoslavia began with the annexation of Bosnia by the Austria-Hungarian Empire in October of 1908 (MID30). Russia agreed to allowing the annexation of Bosnia if it could exchange it for other territories and financial reparations. Russia however failed to account for the Serbian reaction. Yugoslavian Serbs felt betrayed by the Russians and demanded that they retract the deal. Ultimately the annexation could not occur because of Britain and France's threat of war with Austria-Hungary (www.onwar.com 2003). 

The rivalry continued through the First and Second Balkan Wars. Austria Hungary wishing to contain the expansion of the Serbians convinced the Western Powers to create an Independent Albania (Stavrianos 2000), preventing Serbia an outlet to the Adriatic sea and requiring the removal of Serbian forces (MID21). Following the First Balkan War the Treaty of London awarded the Serbs almost all of the remaining Ottoman lands in Europe but Austria backed Bulgaria's attacks in Macedonia (Stavrianos 2000). Bulgaria was defeated and Serbian territorial holdings substantially increased in Macedonia (MID3). 

The final dispute, the First World War, MID257, resolved the issue of Serbian influence in the Balkan region for the Austria-Hungarian Empire once and for all. Although the dispute is coded as ending on November 11th of 1918 (the date of the armistice between Germany and the Allied Powers) the dispute effectively ended with the Treaty of Versailles which called for the dissection of the Austria-Hungarian Empire (Nicolson 2001). The Austro-Hungarian Empire was entirely dismantled, and a new nation of Czechoslovakia was formed. The state of Poland was revived with new borders, Bulgaria and Hungary were reduced in size, and Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became independent states (Clodfelter 1992). The end of the Austria-Hungarian Empire effectively ended the Rivalry with the Yugoslavian Serbs in 1918.
