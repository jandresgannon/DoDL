MID2006

TERRMID: MID2006 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID2006 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2006 Coded not territory because the US and Taiwan/Nationalists did not dispute territory between them. See TERRLINK.

TERRLINK: MID2006 1 -- third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID2006 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2006 Dispute occurs during the Chinese civil war. Per Gibler (2018), nationalists impose a blockade of Communist-held ports. As this blockade was enforced - and ships affected - the US sent warships to escort its commercial ships. Coded third party link to territory because the dispute over the Chinese mainland causes the blockade strategy employed by the Nationalists.
