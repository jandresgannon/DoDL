NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Panama and Germany, similar to other World War II rivalries, involves German naval or air attacks on Panamanian or Panamanian registered vessels. The first attacks occur in July 1940 off the coast of Spain, MID3855. This dyad might not be considered an official rivalry, however, given the fact that in many instances the ships attacked are only registered in Panama but flying the flags of other countries such as the US. Conversely, some ships such as the *Panamanian* which also was sunk in July 1940 were transferred from American registry to Panamanian ownership due to the war. Despite this issue of ownership versus registry, Panama does actually escalate the conflict with Germany with its declaration of war against Germany on December 12, 1941, MID3525. This suggests that the rivalry is perhaps a valid one. Another series of attacks took place off the coast of North America against ships of Panamanian registry in January 1942, MID3881. A final attack occured on November 11, 1943, MID3887. All possibility of conflict is concluded with the defeat of Germany and its unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945, leading to the end of the rivalry.
