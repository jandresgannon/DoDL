CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2610 from Gibler 2018, this was connected to the Congo Crisis in 1960, a period of civil unrest and conflict in DRC. Here, Zaire attacked a Ghanan embassy when the Ghanan ambassador to Zaire was ordered out of Zaire but refused to leave the embassy. Zairean troops attacked the embassy and eventually forced him out of the country. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to the civil conflict in Zaire.
