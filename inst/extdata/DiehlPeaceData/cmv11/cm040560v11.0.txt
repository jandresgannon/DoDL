CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1441 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1441 from cm narrative, this MID is connected to the Angolan civil war and the stationing of Cuban troops in Angola. From Pearce (2012), Cuba and South Africa each provided support to opposing sides in the Angolan Civil War, triggering this MID between them that lasted until the Tripartite Accord ended the civil war and led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola. Coded civil war link because the Angolan Civil War is outside this dyad and causes a MID between these third parties to the dispute.
