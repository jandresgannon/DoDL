TERRLINK-NOTES: MID607 from cm365640 narrative and Gibler 2018, this is a multilateral MID involving Turkey, allied with the US, Jordan, and Iraq, in a territorial dispute against Syria, allied with Egypt and the USSR. After border troop buildups by Turkey and Syria, clashes occurred along the disputed border. The Egyptians and the Americans were involved heavily in the MID, in the form of arms support and, in the case of Egypt, supplying troops to fight. Russia is involved in this MID due to its support for Syria. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Turkey and Syria.

CIVWARMID-NOTES:

CIVWARLINK: MID1039 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1039 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1039 from Gibler 2018, in 1970 PLO terrorists hijacked an airplane headed to Jordan and held the passengers hostage. The terrorists intended to provoke fighting between Jordan and Palestinian rebels. Jordan did indeed attack Palestinian rebels, and Syrian and Jordanian troops clashed in the aftermath, as Syria was sympathetic to the rebels. Coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Palestine, and the hijacking occurred outside of this dyad. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Russia a participant to this MID.
