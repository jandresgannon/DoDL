MARITMID-NOTES: MID1808 from Schultz data, on 1/26/1973, Uruguayan naval vessels tried to seize an Argentinian and a Norwegian vessel who were both in waters claimed by Uruguay. The Norwegian freighter was unloading cargo onto the Argentinian vessel. Uruguay attempted to use a destroyer to coerce the ships into a Uruguayan port, but Argentinian fighter planes ran the destroyer off. Coded not maritime because Uruguay and Argentina disputed the waters, leading to this MID, but Norway was not a party to the maritime claim, although Norway was linked to the maritime dispute.
