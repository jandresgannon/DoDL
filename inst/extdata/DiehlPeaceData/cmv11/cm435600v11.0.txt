CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3119 from Gibler 2018, Mauritania released its portion of the Western Sahara, and Morocco claimed it. Polisario rebels engaged in fighting with Morocco, often coming from and taking refuge in Mauritania. Morocco had warplanes in Mauritanian airspace to combat these rebels, culminating in a twenty minute attack from the air on 29 July 1980. Coded civil war MID because Polisario rebels were attempting to gain sovereignty for Western Sahara by attacking Morocco from positions in Mauritania.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Morocco claimed sovereignty over the French colony of Mauritania in February 1958. Morocco referred the matter to the *League of Arab States *(LAS), and LAS foreign ministers expressed support for Morocco in August 1960. Tunisia provided diplomatic assistance (diplomatic recognition) to Mauritania. Mauritania accused Morocco of supporting subversion in the country on November 8, 1960. Mauritania formally achieved its independence from France on November 28, 1960. On August 20, 1961, King Hassan II of Morocco promised to liberate the territories of Mauritania and Spanish Sahara. Senegal offered to mediate negotiations between the countries in 1963 and 1964. President Bourguiba of Tunisia and President Sekou Toure of Ivory Coast attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries in July 1964. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia provided diplomatic assistance (extension of diplomatic relations) to Mauritania in 1964. President Boumedienne of Algeria mediated negotiations between the countries on September 22-24, 1969. King Hassan II announced that Morocco would agree to formally recognize Mauritania on September 26, 1969. Mauritanian and Moroccan representatives signed the *Treaty of Solidarity, Good Neighborliness, and Cooperation* on June 8, 1970, which provided for the normalization of diplomatic relations between the countries. Morocco and Mauritania both claimed sovereignty over the Spanish Sahara in 1974. The *United Nations *(UN) General Assembly approved a resolution on December 13, 1974, which requested that the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) issue an advisory opinion on the status of the territory. The countries submitted the matter to the ICJ on December 21, 1974. The UN secretary-general sent a fact-finding mission to the territory, and reported that a majority of the inhabitants of the territory favored independence on October 15, 1975. The ICJ issued an advisory opinion on October 16, 1975, which suggested that while there were historical ties between the territory and both Morocco and Mauritania, these ties were not sufficient to preclude the people of the territory choosing to establish an independent country. King Hassan II of Morocco initiated the *Green March* of some 350,000 Moroccans across the border of Western Sahara on November 6, 1975. Spain agreed to abandon the territory to Morocco and Mauritania on November 8, 1975, and King Hassan of Morocco ordered the marchers back into Morocco on November 9, 1975. Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania signed the *Tripartite Agreement* on November 11, 1975, which provided for the relinquishing of Spanish administrative control of the territory (but not sovereignty) to Morocco and Mauritania. Spain withdrew its troops from Spanish Sahara on January 12, 1976, and Spain's presence in the territory formally ended on February 26, 1976. Morocco and Mauritania denounced the declaration of independence by Western Saharan nationalists, and agreed to divide the former Spanish Sahara into two sectors on April 14, 1976. Mauritania and Western Saharan nationalists signed a peace treaty on August 5, 1979. Prime Minister Haydalla of Mauritania announced its renunciation of its claim to Western Sahara on August 10, 1979. Morocco immediately took control of the Mauritanian sector of Western Sahara. Mauritania accused Morocco of involvement in an attempted military rebellion on March 16, 1981, and Mauritania severed diplimatic relations with Morocco on March 17, 1981. Mauritanian and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on April 13, 1985.

Mauritania and Western Saharan nationalists signed a peace treaty on August 5, 1979. Prime Minister Haydalla of Mauritania announced its renunciation of its claim to Western Sahara on August 10, 1979. Morocco immediately took control of the Mauritanian sector of Western Sahara. 

When Mauritania abandoned its portion of Spanish Sahara after being driven out by separatist rebels called the Polisario, Morocco entered and took the territory as its own. In 1980, Morocco became immersed in fighting with these forces, many of which came from Mauritania. This was MID3119.

Mauritania accused Morocco of involvement in an attempted military rebellion on March 16, 1981, and Mauritania severed diplimatic relations with Morocco on March 17, 1981. 

On October 19, 1981, Moroccan fighters made aerial assaults on guerilla forces that were inside Mauritanian territory after the forces had staged an attack in Morocco and retreated into Mauritania. This was MID3094.

Mauritanian and Morocco resumed diplomatic relations on April 13, 1985.

In April of 1987, Morocco announced that it had completed the last portion of a defensive wall in Western Sahara meant to keep Polisario forces out. This last portion of the 2,000-mile long wall was along the border with Mauritania. It does not seem as if there were any significant protests by the Mauritanian government though. This is MID2809.

There have been no more disputes between Mauritania and Morocco since 1987. Mauritania had renounced its claim to Western Sahara in 1979, but Polisario forces continued to stage attacks from Mauritania. The wall may have made the crossing of this border more difficult. Also, the UN sponsored a referendum vote in Western Sahara in 1995 to determine whether or not it wanted to be separate from Morocco. More peaceful relations between Morocco and the rebel groups began later that year. In 1999, Moroccan King Hassan II finally began to withdraw from the Western Sahara. While the issue remained throughout the 1990s of Moroccan control over Western Sahara, it appears that neighboring countries ceased to be quite as involved in the dispute.

There have been no more disputes between Mauritania and Morocco since 1987. Mauritania had renounced its claim to Western Sahara in 1979, but Polisario forces continued to stage attacks from Mauritania, without the help of the Mauritanian government. The wall may have made the crossing of this border more difficult. 

On 4th October, 1988, Morocco and Mauritania signed in Rabat the minutes of the different talks Mauritanian Minister of Equipment Lt-Col Oumar Dieng Harouna had with Moroccan officials the previous week. The minutes were signed by Harouna and Moroccan Minister of Public Works, Staff and Vocational Training Mohamed Kabbaj. The Mauritanian Minister arrived to Morocco on 28th September, 1988. The talks dealt with co-operation between Morocco and Mauritania in road construction, building industry, public works, vocational training. They also tackled co-operation between the two countries' corporations and companies namely the setting up of joint ventures in these areas.

The special envoy of Moroccan King Hassan II, General Housni ben Sleimane, left Nouakchott on January 7, 1989, for Morocco after a trip aimed at smoothing relations between Morocco and Mauritania. Mauritania and Morocco have had strained relations since the Polisario front, the Algerian-backed guerrilla movement in the Western Sahara, shot down a U.S. plane working with an international anti-locust campaign on December 8, 1988. The Moroccan government described the disaster, which took place near the Mauritania-Morocco border, as a "savage action." A spokesman for the Mauritanian government conceded that while the US plane was brought down in the Western Sahara, the surface-to-air missile that destroyed the aircraft was not fired from Mauritanian soil. The Moroccan envoy was received by Mauritanian leader Ahemed Taya on January 6, 1989. Sleimane delivered a letter from King Hassan, the contents of which were not disclosed.

The UN sponsored a referendum vote in Western Sahara in 1995 to determine whether or not it wanted to be separate from Morocco. More peaceful relations between Morocco and the rebel groups began later that year. In 1999, Moroccan King Hassan II finally began to withdraw from the Western Sahara. While the issue remained throughout the 1990s of Moroccan control over Western Sahara, it appears that neighboring countries ceased to be quite as involved in the dispute.

King Mohammed VI of Morocco arrived in Mauritania on September 10, 2001 on a three-day visit that officials hope will improve relations between the two countries. The king's visit to Nouakchott is the first by a Moroccan monarch since 1970. The late Moroccan King Hassan II briefly visited Mauritania in 1970 to discuss the future of the Western Sahara. Relations between Morocco and Mauritania have been strained for decades by the long-running dispute over the Western Sahara, which Morocco occupied in 1975. According to an official statement, King Mohammed VI was to hold several rounds of talks with Mauritanian President Moawiya Ould Tayeh. The king was also expected to tour a steel factory. The official Mauritanian news agency said the king's visit was "a great opportunity for consultations between the two leaders concerning the best ways to promote bilateral cooperation as well as Arab, African and international issues." On January 31, 2002, Morocco and Mauritania have signed several protocols and bilateral cooperation agreements at the end of the proceedings of the second session of the higher Moroccan-Mauritanian joint committee today in Rabat under the chairmanship of the two prime ministers, Messrs Abderrahmane Youssoufi and Cheikh El Afia Ould Mohamed Khouna. Morocco and Mauritanian opened on 6 May 2003, in Rabat, the third session of their high joint commission under the co-chairmanship of Moroccan Prime Minister, Driss Jettou, and Mauritanian peer, Cheikh El Afia Ould Mohamed Khouna. The two Prime Ministers will initial eight cooperation agreements and executive programs in the realms of tourism, craftsmanship, health, local authorities, interior affairs, culture and sport. Speaking at the meeting, Jettou termed the two countries' bilateral relations as solid and strong but he deemed that they should be further reinforced to integrate all realms. "Strengthening Morocco-Mauritania relations will contribute to the consolidation of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU, mustering Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia)," he said. The Mauritanian prime minister said "the session is an opportunity to probe questions of common interest and enlarge the scope of bilateral cooperation." Jettou arrived in Mauritania for a two-day official visit, leading a large delegation comprising foreign affairs and cooperation minister, craftsmanship and social economy minister, equipment and transport minister, health minister, fisheries minister and exterior trade minister.

On 31 August, 2003, the Moroccan Energy and Mining Minister Mohamed Boutaleb left the capital Nouakchott on 29 August 2003 at the end of an official visit to our country at the invitation of his Mauritanian counterpart, Mines and Industry Minister Zeidane Ould H'media. The visit, which fell within the framework of activating bilateral cooperation in accordance with the recommendations of the joint higher Mauritanian-Moroccan committee, has enabled the Moroccan delegation to visit several industrial installations and establishments in the country, such as the Mauritanian bureau for geological research and the installations of the of the national industry and mining company "SNIM", in addition to industrial units in Zouerate and Nouadhibou where the members acquainted themselves with the great strides achieved by our country in this sphere. During the visit, the two ministers also signed a protocol agreement on prospecting and exploiting mineral and mining resources. On March 18, 2004 Mauritanian president Maaouiya Ould made an official visit to Morocco. On 26 May, 2004, Mauritanian Prime Minister Sghair Ould M'Bareck has said that HM King Mohammed VI of Morocco placed special importance on cooperation between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. The Mauritanian prime minister said in a statement to the press after his meeting at the royal palace in Agadir with HM King Mohammed VI that he had handed his majesty "a message of brotherhood from His Excellency President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya of Mauritania" affirming that the existing cooperation between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Mauritania was "distinguished and reflected the will of the leaders of the two countries, HM King Mohammed VI and His Excellency President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya". He added that he had informed his majesty during the meeting of the results of the fourth session of the Moroccan-Mauritanian joint higher committee which ended on Wednesday 26 May in Rabat. Sghair Ould M'Bareck said the session "took place in good conditions", highlighting that the agreements which came at the end of the session included "strengthening cooperation between the two brotherly countries".

Moroccan Prime Minister Driss Jettou arrived in Noukchott on July 15, 2005 to attend the fifth session of the Morocco-Mauritania joint co-operation commission, official said in Nouakchott. The Mauritanian Prime Minister, Sghaer Ould M'Bareck, received his Moroccan counterpart, who is leading a high-powered delegation, including cabinet ministers and Moroccan business operators. The fifth joint Morocco-Mauritania co-operation session opens in Nouakchott aimed at deriving ways of further enhancing bilateral ties. Mauritania and Morocco maintain economic ties in various economic sectors and belong to the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) also comprising Algeria, Libya and Tunisia.

On October 4, 2005, the chairman of the Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) in Mauritania, Col Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, has expressed his desire to further cement ties with Morocco. Ould Vall made the statement in a message Mauritanian ambassador to Morocco, Cheikh Ould Ely, delivered to King Mohammed VI in Guelmin, Southern Morocco, according to national television channel "2M". The Mauritanian military leader, who came to power in a bloodless coup 3 August, noted that the ruling CMJD was "determined to enhance the excellent relations" with Morocco. Ambassador Ould Ely said the Mauritanian leader's message was intended as part of continued dialogue between the two leaders on issues of common interest to the two countries. Morocco and Mauritania are members of the Maghreb Arab Union (UMA), along with Libya, Algeria and Tunisia.
