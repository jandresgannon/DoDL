MID2756 

TERRMID: MID2756 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID2756 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2756 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, an Angolan jet mistook a Botswanan plane for a military jet and fired on it. No protest was made by Botswana. Coded not territory because the countries were not disputing a boundary, and coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped since the lack of protest from Botswana means this is not a MID.
