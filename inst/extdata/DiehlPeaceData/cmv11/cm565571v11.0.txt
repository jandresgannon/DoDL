ISLMID-NOTES: MID4117 from Gibler 2018, Botswana and Namibia disputed ownership of several islands in the Chobe River. In 1997, Botswana stationed troops on the islands and ordered the residents to not farm there, and Namibia sent patrols into Botswana in response. A mediation attempt occurred but was unsuccessful.

Botswana and Namibia dispute the border demarcation along the Chobe River, and both claim several islands including Situngu Island. Situngu is submerged for much of the year, but is apparently cultivated when not submerged. Namibia claims Botswana is occupying the island--Botswana denies the claim. On Oct. 4, Botswana Defence Force soldiers reportedly told farmers to leave the area. Accusations by Namibia of Botswana's occupation follow in Jan 1998. Namibia claims Botswana wants to build military bases to thwart efforts at farming. Agreement reached on 1/22/98 violated almost immediately. Followed by a border violation by Namibia in April. First day of dispute was on 10/22/1997 and last day of dispute was on 4/20/1998.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Botswana and Namibia disputed the sovereignty of Kasikili (Sedudu) Island in the Chobe River after Namibia's independence from South Africa on March 21, 1990. Botswana troops occupied the island in 1991. Botswana and Namibia appointed a joint team of technical experts to determine the border between the countries on May 24, 1992. The joint team of technical experts was unable to resolve the dispute concerning the Kasikili (Sedudu) Island. President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe mediated negotiations between Botswana and Namibia representatives, but the negotiations ended unsuccessfully on February 15, 1995. President Masire of Botswana and President Nujoma of Namibia agreed on February 15, 1995 to "submit the dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) for a final and binding determination." Botswana and Namibia signed an agreement in Gaborone, Botswana on February 15, 1996, which provided for the submission of the territorial dispute to the ICJ on the basis of the *Anglo-German Treaty* of July 1, 1890. The countries formally submitted the dispute to the ICJ on May 29, 1996. The ICJ issued a decision on December 13, 1999, which awarded Kasikili (Sedudu) Island to Botswana.

In January 1998, Namibian villagers in Caprivi claimed that Botswanan troops would not allow them access to the islands. During the first two weeks in April of 1998, Namibian patrols entered Botswanan territory twice. At the same time, Namibia claimed that its farmers along the border between the two countries were being harassed by Botswanan troops. 

The ICJ issued a decision on December 13, 1999, which awarded Kasikili (Sedudu) Island to Botswana. It is too soon to determine whether or not both sides will respect the decision, thus ending the rivalry.
