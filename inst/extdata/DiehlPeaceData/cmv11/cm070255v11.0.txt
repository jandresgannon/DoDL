RIVNOTES: 
All three disputes in rivalry 199 are related to World War II and occur in a narrow time frame. Accordingly, we do not code rivalry 1999 as a proto-rivalry, but place it in the isolated category.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Mexico and Germany takes place in the context of World War II. During this period there are three mids that occur, MID3831 on 12/19/1939, MID3877 on 4/24/1942 and MID3524 on 5/22/1942. These disputes involve the presence of German naval vessels in Mexican waters. Mexico's decision to ally with the US and the Allies in May 1942, brings this war rivalry to its height. Mexico's decision to enter into the war on the side of the Allies it claimed was because of the Axis declaration of war on the United States. According to Mexico, the country's signature of the Havana agreement for hemsipheric defense made it necessary for Mexico to enter into conflict. Germany's defeat in 1945 by the Allies marks the end of the militarized disputes between the two countries.
