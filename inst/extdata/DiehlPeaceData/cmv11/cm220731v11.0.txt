CIVWARLINK: MID3951 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3951 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3951 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-47), a French warship fired shots to halt a North Korean freighter as part of the trade embargo against Iraq. GLM suggest this case be dropped because there was no protest from North Korea. Coded civil war link because the embargo against Iraq was connected to civil conflict activity (the embargo was part of sanctions to prevent Hussein from attacking Kurds), and this MID is connected to that embargo. Coded uncertain because GLM recommend this case be dropped.
