MID3181

TERRMID: MID3181 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler (2018), Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente, but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force to prevent Austria from joining Germany or the Little Entente. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because no states were disputing territory here, although Austria was intending to voluntarily unify with another country (other countries) to solve its economic crisis.

TERRMID: MID2877 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID2877 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2877 from Gibler (2018), Austria protested alleged border violations by Italy and Hungary, triggering this MID. Coded not territory because no border was being disputed and this was likely connected to the Cold War.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Austria ceded South Tyrol (Bolzano province) to Italy in 1919. Austria requested the return of South Tyrol on April 22, 1946, but the *Allied Council of Foreign Ministers* (ACFM) rejected the request on April 30, 1946. Austrian and Italian representatives began bilateral negotiations concerning South Tyrol in London in June 1946. Foreign Minister Karl Gruber of Austria and Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi signed an agreement in Paris on September 5, 1946, which provided for autonomy for South Tyrol (Bolzano province) within Italy. The Italian Constituent Assembly approved legislation on January 29, 1948, which provided regional autonomy to South Tyrol. Austria sent a memorandum to Italy on October 8, 1956, which argued that Italy had not completely implemented the 1946 agreement. Italy replied to the memorandum on February 9, 1957. The countries began bilateral negotiations in Vienna on February 22, 1958. Austria requested mediation by the United States in 1959, but the US declined the request. Austria referred the matter to the *Council of Europe* (COE) in 1959, and the COE recommended that the dispute be referred to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ). Austria referred the matter to the *United Nations* (UN) General Assembly in October 1960. The UN General Assembly appealed for peaceful negotiations concerning the South Tyrol dispute on October 27, 1960. Austria and Italy signed an agreement in 1969, which provided more autonomy for South Tyrol. Italy ratified the agreement on December 5, 1969, and Austria ratified the agreement on December 16, 1969.
