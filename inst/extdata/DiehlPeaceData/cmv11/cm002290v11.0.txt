MID27 

TERRMID: MID27 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID27 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID27 is a multilateral MID involving Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, and the USSR versus the USA, the UK, France, and West Germany. This is the crisis that eventually led to the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Khrushchev gave an ultimatum for the US to leave West Berlin, which threatened the status of West Berlin. The USSR was concerned about the growing military power of West Germany and threatened to sign a peace treaty with East Germany, further threatening western interests. Coded not territory because the US and Poland had no territorial claim. Rather, West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) claimed the territory of East Germany (German Democratic Republic) as rightfully its own, and while Poland, as part of the Soviet bloc, backed East Germany's position in this dispute, there was no disputed territorial boundary between the US and Poland. See TERRLINK.

RIVNOTES: 

MID27 is the Berlin Wall Crisis. This is a multilateral dispute involving many countries including the US in opposition to Czechoslovakia. The Berlin dispute had simmered ever since Khrushchev threatened (1958) to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. This action would seriously threaten the status of West Berlin, as well as Western access to the city.
