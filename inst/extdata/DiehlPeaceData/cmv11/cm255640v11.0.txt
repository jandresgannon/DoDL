NARRATIVE-CR:
Conflict between Germany and Turkey was ignited over the issue of Serbian independence in 1876 (MID3322). Turkey launched an all out offensive against Serbia in August of 1876 and successfully defeated Serbian forces (Clodfelter 1992). German, Austrian and Russian support of Serbia came through the lending of troops in the war against Turkey. In response, Turkey negotiated a ceasefire on October 18th of 1876. In 1881 the Western Powers (Germany is included) granted Thessaly and Arta to Greece in response to the Greek discontent over the Treaty of Berlin, which served mainly to benefit the Ottoman Empire (MID141). Thessaly and Arta were given to Greece while the rest of the territories were returned to Turkey (Stavrianos 2000). The Allied Powers again intervened in 1897 (MID56) and demanded Turkish withdrawal (MID391). The Ottoman Empire/Turkey had claimed rights over Crete insisting that the island was Muslim and not Christian and therefore not rightly the property of Greece (Danopoulos 1997). By 1897 Greece began sending troops to Crete and began hostilities with Turkey. Allied intervention in 1897 forced an Armistice and then a Peace Treaty between Greece and Turkey. December 4th the Treaty was concluded and Crete was made an international protectorate in exchange for Greece granting Turkey some land in Thessaly and a tribute. 

With the escalating tensions between Germany and the Western powers Turkey tried to hedge its bets. In may of 1939 Turkey signed a declaration of mutual assistance with Britain (Davison 1998). However, later that year Russia signed the Nazi-Soviet pack of August 23, 1939. Turkey, fearing Russia signed a mutual defense alliance with the Allied powers on October 19, 1939. However, when Italy attacked France in 1940 Turkey instead remained neutral. When German forces began pouring into Yugoslavia after defeating Greece and set up occupation in Bulgaria Turkey began to feel the pressure of German demands for supplies (MID3850). With German troops so close, Bulgaria and Turkey sign a non-aggression pact on February 16th, 1941. Bulgaria succumbed to German pressures and signed the tripartite in March of 1941 (Davison 1998). Turkey tried its best to play the neutrality card, waiting to see which side would be victorious. by spring of 1944 with the German retreat from Crimea it became clear that Russian forces would soon be advancing into the region. Turkey wishing to establish some accommodation with the Allies severed diplomatic ties with Germany in August and declared war on Germany by February of 1945 (MID614). The end of the rivalry came about with the defeat of Germany following the Second World War. The German military was eliminated and the German state split into occupied zones, effectively ending any long-term rivalries held between the German state and the Turkish state.
