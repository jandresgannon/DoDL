NARRATIVE-CR:
The disputes between Colombia and the UK in the 19th century are somewhat related. On January 20, 1836 Colombian forces took possession of the British embassy in Bogota and arrested the Pro-Consul, MID1623. On January 21, 1837, Great Britain blockaded Colombia in an effort to force Colombia release the British Pro-Consul and to address claims made against it with regard to the attack on the Pro-Consul in 1836, MID2243. In October 1857, Great Brtiain sent ships into Colombian waters to examine the possibility of building a naval depot to protect its coal shipping in the area. The ships also blockaded Colombia at the end of October, MID1757 to press claims by British nationals in the region, particularly one known as the Mackintosh claim. 

In terms of characterizing these disputes, it could be suggested that this dyad is a rivalry involving British protection of its territory and/or nationals in Colombia from 1836 to 1857. The election of President Ospina in 1857 along with the presence of the British fleet seems to have led to the resolution of British claims in May 1857 and thus the end of the rivalry.
