PS-UPDATE2020:Relationship shifts from lesser rivalry to negative peaces as the two states restore relations and are helped by resolution of the Eritrea-Ethiopia war.  They also restore trade if Eritrea released all prisoners of war. After this, the U.N. also lifted its sanctions on Eritrea.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4187 from cm narrative, This dispute includes two border fortifications, one by Djibouti against Eritrea, the other several months later by Eritrea against Djibouti. The first fortification was motivated by Djibouti's desire to limit the potential for Eritrean forces to launch attacks against Ethiopia through Djibouti. Djibouti sided with Ethiopia in the war that erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998. Reports regarding the second fortification suggest that Eritrea was demonstrating its displeasure by massing troops on the border with Djibouti, which allowed landlocked Ethiopia access to its seaports for supplies during the conflict. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, outside this dyad.

TERRMID: MID4398 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID4398 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4398 from cm narrative, On April 28, 2008, Eritrean forces crossed the border into Djibouti and began building defensive positions, most notably troop trenches on both sides of the border. It is unclear for how long the Eritrean troops remained in the territory of Djibouti. Eritrean troops pursued Eritrean military deserters into Djiboutan territory where they encountered and fired upon Djiboutan military units. The Djiboutans responded with military force. Two Djiboutan soldiers were killed in the clash. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between the countries, specifically an undemarcated area (Frank 2015). 

TERRLINK: MID4398 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID4398 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4398 The Eritreans used this dispute to complain about their United Nations-backed Ethiopian-Eritrean border. In this sense, the MID represents an unusual case where a state used a non-linked MID to reopen a link, which would (in theory) bolster its negotiating position. Coded not third party link to territory here because the events of this MID begin and end with Djibouti/Eritrean border movements. There is no evidence that the Ethiopians left their territory or instigated the dispute (Frank 2015).

NO MILITARIZED ACTION 

Following its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has been involved in several disputes (diplomatic and militarized) with its neighbors and nearby countries. This dispute between Eritrea and Djibouti involves territory. Eritrea claims a 500-sq.km piece of territory in northern Djibouti based on a 1935 Italian colonial map. In the two incidents included in this dispute, Djibouti objected to an Eritrean military incursion into the area in late 1995 and the shelling of a frontier post by Eritrean forces in 1996. No deaths occurred in this dispute. Media sources speculate that Eritrea was suspicious of Djibouti based on its relatively close relationship with Yemen, a country that had a more serious dispute with Eritrea in the mid-1990s. First day of dispute was on 12/00/1995 and last day of dispute was on 4/00/1996.

DISPLAY OF FORCE 

This dispute includes two border fortifications, one by Djibouti against Eritrea, the other several months later by Eritrea against Djibouti. The first fortification was motivated by Djibouti's desire to limit the potential for Eritrean forces to launch attacks against Ethiopia through Djibouti. Djibouti sided with Ethiopia in the war that erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998. Reports regarding the second fortification suggest that Eritrea was demonstrating its displeasure by massing troops on the border with Djibouti, which allowed landlocked Ethiopia access to its seaports for supplies during the conflict. First day of dispute was on 6/00/1998 and last day of dispute was on 12/00/1998.
