TERRLINK: MID2244 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID2244 3 -- uncertain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2244 from Gibler 2018, in 1954 South Korea threatened war with North Korea after the reunification talks ended. The US threatened North Korea with war if they invaded South Korea. North and South Korea then exchanged threats. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the North-South Korea dispute, a territorial dispute in which each claimed the entirety of the other's territory. Coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Taiwan a party to this dispute.
