TERRMID-CER: MID2608 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2608 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-25), Guinea placed a US diplomat on house arrest on 10/30/1966, triggering this MID. The Guinean government believed the US government was responsible for diplomatic incidents in Ghana, but when it was proven that the US was not involved in those incidents, the diplomat was released. GLM recommend this MID be dropped because the seizure lasted less than one day. Coded not territory because Guinea was not making a claim on US territory here, and coded uncertain because GLM recommend this case be dropped.
