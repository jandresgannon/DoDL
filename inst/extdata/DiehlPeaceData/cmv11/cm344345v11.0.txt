NARRATIVE-CM:
Croatia formally declared its independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, but ethnic Serbs opposed their incorporation into Croatia (ethnic Serbians had already begun an armed rebellion against the Croatian government on May 2, 1991). Ethnic Serb militia, which were supported by Yugoslavia, controlled some 33 percent of Croatia by August 1991. The government of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) asked the *European Community* (EC) to intercede with the Croatian government to prevent violence against ethnic Serbs in other parts of Croatia. On September 1, 1991, the EC agreed to expand the *European Community Monitoring Mission* (ECMM)-which had already been deployed in Slovenia-to Croatia. The *United Nations *(UN) Security Council imposed an arms embargo against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) on September 25, 1991. The UN secretary-general appointed Cyrus Vance of the United States as his personal envoy for the former Yugoslavia on October 8, 1991. The EC imposed an arms embargo against Yugoslavia on November 8, 1991, and imposed economic sanctions against Yugoslavia on November 11, 1991. The UN envoy mediated cease-fire agreements between Croatia and Yugoslavia on November 23, 1991 and January 2, 1992. The UN Security Council established the *United Nations Protection Force in Croatia* (UNPROFOR-Croatia) on February 21, 1992 to monitor the ceasefire in Croatia. The UN Security Council approved the admission of Croatia on May 22, 1992. Croatia and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) established diplomatic relations in 1996.

NARRATIVE-CR:

MID3555: dispute takes place between January and July 1992 and involves the fighting between Yugoslavia and Croatia in Bosnia at the Bosnian and Croatian border. Eventually, the tensions and fighting eased as both turned their attention to Bosnia.

MID4100: between May and October 1995, Yugoslavia repeatedly showed force on its border with East Slavonia of Croatia.

MID4230: In June of 1997 Croatia places its units on a state of alert. This alert applied to its forces along the Montenegran border.

MID4298: In August 2000, Yugoslavia seized a Croatian freighter, the ``Dea,'' which was released 2 days later. Shortly after this incident, the USA and Croatia conducted a joint naval exercise. The USA claims that the timing was a coincidence, but acknowledged that it had been delayed and rescheduled at Croatian request.

MID4340: This MID occurred from January 24, 1993 to February 20, 1993. This incident is about the decision of Croatian President Tudjman to attack the ethnic Serbs within Croatia.

On June 25, 1991, Croatia declares independence. Croatia officially enters the international system on January 15, 1992 when the European Community and the United Nations agreed to recognize it as an independent state. Official membership in the United National occured on May 22, 1992. 

RIV891 results from the May 1991 referendum in Croatia, where the majority of Croats voted for independence from Yugoslavia; most Serbians in Croatia boycotted the vote and supported staying part of Yugoslavia. On June 25, 1991 Croatia declared independence, resulting in the outbreak of war with Yugoslavia. Tensions and distrust were high between Serbs and Croats during and following the war. The Serb-dominated Yugoslavian army shelled civilians during the campaign. In January 1992, Croatia and Yugoslavia signed a UN supervised armistice. The two states continued to negotiate over the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina until Bosnia-Herzegovina voted by referendum to unilaterally separate from Yugoslavia in March of 1992, followed by an official declaration of independence. 

MID3555 represents the first dispute of RiV891. MID4298, between August 9 and September 29 2000, represents the last dispute of RIV891. 

In March 1998 fighting erupts in Kosovo between the majority Albanians and Serbs and within months some 350,000 people have been displaced or fled abroad. In October, 1998, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and partial pull-out of Yugoslav forces and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe sent the first of 2,000 `verifiers' to monitor the agreement. In February, 1999, talks were held in Rambouillet, France, but discussions broke down and tensions and repressions rise again in Kosovo. In March, 1999, after repeated warnings, NATO launched its 78-day air war. On June 3, 1999, Yugoslavia accepted a peace plan requiring withdrawal of all forces from Kosovo and the entry of peacekeepers under a U.N. mandate.

On April 1, 2001, Milosovic was arrested on charges of abuse of power and corruption. On June 28 he was extradited to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. His trial on charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia and Kosovo began at The Hague on February 12, 2002. On April 11, the Yugoslav parliament passed a law allowing extradition of all persons charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. In March 2002, the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to dissolve FRY in favour of a new, much weaker form of cooperation called "Serbia and Montenegro". By order of Yugoslav Federal Parliament on February 4, 2003, Yugoslavia ceased to exist.

PS-NARRATIVE: 

20010430-20041114 Transition 

RIV891 changes dramatically with the removal of Milosevic from power and his arrest on April 1, 2001. The rivalry is motivated by Croatia's declaration of independence and, subsequently, by fear that Milosevic would try to create a ``Greater Serbia'' by forcefully reuniting the former Yugoslavian provinces. Many of these fears are alleviated with the NATO war in Kosovo and the capture of Milosevic. 

In July 1999, Croatia submits an application to the International Court of Justice, accusing Serbia of committing acts of genocide against the Croatian population during the time period of 1991-1995. Yugoslavia filed a objection in 2002, arguing against the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case and against the admissibility of the application by Croatia. Croatia filed a response to the objection by April 2003. In November 2008, the ICJ ruled that it did have jurisdiction to hear the case filed by Croatia against Serbia. As of February 2009, the case is still pending before the ICJ.

In June 2000, the president of Montenegro apologized publicly to Croatia for shelling Croatia during the 1991 war, where Yugoslavian troops, drawn heavily from Montenegro, attempted to prevent Croatia's independence. 

In April 2003, in the wake of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic's assassination in March 2003, presumably to prevent Serbia from moving closer to Europe, Croatian President Stjepan Mesic declared that all attempts to create ``greater'' states in the region should come to an end and that the two countries would continue to more toward integration with Europe and greater cooperation.

In December 2003, the Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader expressed optimism regarding the democratic elections in Serbia but reserved judgment regarding whether Serbia would continue to move closer to Europe. He also expressed his desire for normalization of relations with Serbia-Montenegro and for Serbia to joint the EU if Serbia could meet certain conditions.

In March 2004, protesters hurled stones at Croatia's embassy in Belgrade. Presumably, the protesters were angry over events in Kosovo. Security was increased at the embassy. Croatia's Foreign Minister made a verbal protest to Serbia-Montenegro over the incident. Serbia assured Croatian officials that the incident was an isolated act of violence and would not occur again. 

20041115-20159999 0.5 

On November 15, 2004, the Croatian premier visited Belgrade for the first time since the war that facilitated the breakup of the former Yugoslavia began. The two countries declared a new era in bilateral relations. The President of Serbia-Montenegro, Svetozar Marovic, and Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader signed an agreement aimed at increasing cooperation, addressing issues of refugees and ethnic minorities, and outlined a commitment by both states to assist each other in become members of both the European Union and NATO.

In February 2005, the Serbian President Boris Tadic declares that relations between Croatia and Serbia are key for the future stability and cooperation of the former Yugoslavian states. He stressed the need for the two countries to cooperate in the area of technological advances and on economic issues because neither country was strong enough. 

From the end of RIV891 to November 2004 represents a transition period out of rivalry for Croatia and Serbia. Croatian fears of Milosevic trying to create a ``Greater Serbia'' are somewhat alleviated with the removal of Milosavic from power; however, leaders in Croatia are cautious during this initial post-Milosavic regarding whether Serbia will move closer to Europe. The assassination of PM Djindjic and the democratic election in Serbia in 2003 mark a period of skepticism followed by cautious optimism regarding the future of Serbia and, thus, the prospects for closer relations between the two countries. 

Croatia filed a petition with the ICJ against Serbia for war crimes committed during the 1991-1995 period. This applications is a continuing area of tension between the two states. The signing of a cooperative agreement in November of 2004 marks a key moment in the transition of this relationship from rivalry to friendship. Nevertheless, until the ICJ case is resolved prospects for further improvement of relations may be limited. Consequently, this dyad will remain in transition.
