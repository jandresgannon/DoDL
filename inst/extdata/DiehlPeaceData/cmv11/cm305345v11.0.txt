In 1919, Yugoslav troops pushed into Carinthia, and Austria soon sent troops in as well, triggering this MID. A plebiscite eventually led to the territory being given to Austria. Coded territorial MID because this was centered on disputed territory. TERRLINK: MID3599 3 -- not third party link to territory TERRLINK-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain TERRLINK-NOTES: MARITMID: MID3599 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID3599 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID3599 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3599 from Gibler (2018), an armed resistance in Carinthia formed to expel the Yugoslav forces in 1918. Coded civil war MID because this amounts to a militarized rebel group opposing the government which claimed sovereignty over the territory. Because the Austro-Hungarian empire held the territory previously, the armed resistance fell within Austria post-WWI (i.e., within this dyad).CIVWARLINK: MID3599 3 -- not civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID3599 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID3599 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID3599 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3181TERRMID: MID3181 3 -- not territoryTERRMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certain TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler (2018), Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente, but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force to prevent Austria from joining Germany or the Little Entente. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because Yugoslavia and Austria were not disputing territory here (the earlier issue over Carinthia was resolved at this point), although Austria was intending to voluntarily unify with another country (other countries) to solve its economic crisis. TERRLINK: MID3181 3 -- not third party link to territory TERRLINK-CER: MID3181 1 -- certainTERRLINK-NOTES: MARITMID: MID3181 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certainMARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID3181 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certainISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID3181 3 -- not civil war CIVWARMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certainCIVWARMID-NOTES:CIVWARLINK: MID3181 3 -- not civil war linkCIVWARLINK-CER: MID3181 1 -- certainCIVWARLINK-NOTES: COUPMID: MID3181 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID3181 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID3181 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID3181 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3976 TERRMID: MID3976 3 -- not territory TERRMID-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain TERRMID-NOTES: TERRLINK: MID3976 1 -- third party link to territorial MIDTERRLINK-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3976 coded third party link to territorial MID because this is connected to the Yugoslav Wars, which had an interstate territorial dispute element. Croatia and Slovenia declared independence on 6/25/1991, and this MID occurs two days later, 6/27/1991, making it interstate since Croatia and Slovenia were independent and that was the proximate cause of this MID. MARITMID: MID3976 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID3976 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID3976 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3976 from Gibler (2018), this MID occurred in 1991 while Yugoslavia was experiencing civil and international conflict. (Militarized rebel groups were fighting in Yugoslavian states organized along ethnic lines.) During the conflict in Yugoslavia, Austria publicly speculated about Slovenian and Croatian independence, which angered Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia closed the Austrian border, and Austria massed troops along the border and performed military exercises in response. Coded civil war MID because the war in Yugoslavia, which had a civil war element, was connected to Austria's comments on Slovenian and Croatian independence, which was connected to the events of this MID.CIVWARLINK: MID3976 1 -- civil war link CIVWARLINK-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3976 coded civil war link because this is connected to the Yugoslav Wars, which featured militarized rebel groups in countries outside of this dyad such as Albania and Croatia. COUPMID: MID3976 3 -- not coup COUPMID-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain COUPMID-NOTES: COUPLINK: MID3976 3 -- not coup linkCOUPLINK-CER: MID3976 1 -- certain COUPLINK-NOTES: MID4186 TERRMID: MID4186 3 -- not territory TERRMID-CER: MID4186 1 -- certain TERRMID-NOTES: TERRLINK: MID4186 1 -- third party link to territorial MID TERRLINK-CER: MID4186 1 -- certain TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4186 from cm255345 narrative, this is one of two MIDs connected to Yugoslavia's withdrawal from Kosovo and the lingering hostilities between Yugoslavia and UN/NATO forces. Clashes occurred as Milosevic was attempting to hold onto power in Serbia. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo was partially territorial in nature, as Yugoslavia did not recognize its independence and claimed its territory as its own due to ethnic Serbs. UN/NATO countries' military intervention in Kosovo pulls them into this MID. MARITMID: MID4186 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID4186 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID4186 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID4186 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID4186 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID4186 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4186 the Yugoslavian War involved extensive fighting between insurgent groups organized along ethnic lines, and these groups sometimes fought against states as well.

These MIDs are coded separately due to the temporal separation between them. Clashes occurred as Milosevic was attempting to hold onto power in Serbia. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo was partially territorial in nature, as Yugoslavia did not recognize its independence and claimed its territory as its own due to ethnic Serbs. UN/NATO countries' military intervention in Kosovo pulls them into this MID. MARITMID: MID4343 3 -- not maritime MARITMID-CER: MID4343 1 -- certain MARITMID-NOTES: ISLMID: MID4343 3 -- not islands ISLMID-CER: MID4343 1 -- certain ISLMID-NOTES: CIVWARMID: MID4343 1 -- civil war MIDCIVWARMID-CER: MID4343 1 -- certain CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4343 the Yugoslavian War involved extensive fighting between insurgent groups organized along ethnic lines, and these groups sometimes fought against states as well.

At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. First day of dispute was on 2/21/2000 and last day of dispute was on 4/3/2000.MID4343rivalry=305345 nationa=YUGOSLAVIA-SERBIA nationb=AUSTRIA MID4343 20001124-20001128  revtype1a=POLICY revtype2a=NOT APPLICABLE fatala=NONE fatalpa=0 lhosta=DISPLAY OF FORCE  revtype1b=NOT APPLICABLE revtype2b=NOT APPLICABLE fatalb=NONE fatalpb=0 lhostb=NO MILITARIZED ACTION First day of dispute was on 11/24/2000 and last day of dispute was on 11/28/2000.NO DISPUTE NARRATIVE AVAILABLE FROM COWRIVNOTES: RIV803: MID4186 removed in because does not appear in the COW dyadic 3.1 data or the Maoz 2.0 dyadic data. RIV803: MID4186, this MID has been broken up into two MID4186 & MID4343 because the incidents were more than 6 months apart in mid3.02NARRATIVE-CM:Austria and Yugoslavia disputed the sovereignty of the Klagenfurt Basin in January 1919. Austrian and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Treaty of St. Germain* on September 10, 1919, which provided for Yugoslav sovereignty over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Dalmatia. The *Allied Conference of Ambassadors* (ACA), which consisted of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States, established a commission consisting of 60 military officers from Britain, France, and Italy to monitor a plebiscite in the disputed territory on October 10, 1920. A majority of the residents of the Klagenfurt Basin voted in favor of joining Austria. Yugoslav troops occupied part of the Klagenfurt Basin on October 14, 1920. The ACA demanded the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from the region on Octoner 20, 1920. Yugoslav troops withdrew from the Klagenfurt Basin, and Austria retained sovereignty over the region on November 18, 1920.SOURCES-CM: Ference, 1994, 393-436; Langer, 1972, 1013-1016, 1021-1023; *Survey of International Affairs *(SIA), 1925 (supplement), 14.NARRATIVE-CR:SOURCES-CR:SOURCES: Gibler, D.M. 2018.
