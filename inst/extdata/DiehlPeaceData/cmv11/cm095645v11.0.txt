RIVNOTES: 

RIV254 is not coded as a rivalry because all mids are related to the Iran-Iraq war.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The conflicts between Panama and Iraq hardly qualify as a rivalry in the substantive context. The four militarized disputes between them are actually not genuine disputes between the two governments but are merely the result of Iraqi attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf (MID3049 on 4/19/84, MID2552 on 3/15/87, MID2811 on 4/29/87, and MID2769 on 1/31/88). The attacks were not aimed at Panama but rather any vessles attempting to ship oil or other supplies from or to Iran. This fact alone does not exclude the disputes from making up a rivalry, but when one considers that the attacks were on ships registered in Panama and not actually owned by Panama, it seems that these attacks should not fall into the rivalry category. Regardless of the classification, the disputes are terminated due to the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988.
