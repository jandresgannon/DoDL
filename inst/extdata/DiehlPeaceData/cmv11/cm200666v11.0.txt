MARITMID: MID3229 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID3229 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3229 from Gibler (2018), Israel claimed a port in the Red Sea, and Jordan and UK rejected the claim. In 1949, RAF planes were shot down by Israeli planes, leading to clashes. Coded maritime MID because this was centered on a dispute over sovereignty of a port in the Red Sea. UK was actively involved in the dispute and was not merely supporting Jordan's position, and UK was involved in threats of force as well. Therefore this is a maritime MID between UK and Israel and UK is also linked to the maritime dispute between Israel and Jordan.

TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID1008 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID1008 3 -- uncertain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1008 from Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016), this MID involves clashes between Israel and Jordan during their 1955 war. UK is involved due to their support for Israel. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the Israel-Jordan dispute is territorial. Coded uncertain because GML argue that this case should be dropped/merged with MID1006.
