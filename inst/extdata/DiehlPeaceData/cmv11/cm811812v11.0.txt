TERRMID-NOTES: MID2149 comprises attacks by Khmer soldiers on Laotian civilians along the border in 1977. Laos ordered their soldiers not to return fire in order to avoid straining their resources, which were devoted to fighting an insurgency. The border between Laos and Cambodia was unsettled at the time of MID2149. Both countries had communist governments in the years after the Vietnam War, including during MID2149, but the governments were not friendly. Cambodia was highly suspicious of Vietnam and relations between Cambodia and Laos deteriorated due to Cambodian suspicions that Laos was too friendly with Vietnam, especially after a 1977 treaty of friendship and cooperation between Laos and Vietnam. The Khmer Rouge also had racist attitudes toward ethnic Lao, banning the language from being spoken in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge claimed that "all areas in Laos and Thailand with Khmer language inscriptions were rightfully Cambodian" (Baird 2010: 200). Coded territorial MID because the border was unresolved, the Khmer government claimed part of what was Laos' sovereign territory, and the areas attacked by Khmer forces, Khone Falls and Attapeu, were in the area claimed as rightfully Cambodian by the Khmer Rouge. 

The date of the dispute is somewhere between July 24 1977 and September 29 1977, according to reporting by the NYT. On July 24 1977, the NYT reported that the border was peaceful. On September 29 1977, it mentioned in a story that clashes had occurred along the border but did not mention a specific date. This range is consistent with (and narrower than) the 19770500-19771002 range.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2149 occurred soon after the Cambodian civil war and the Vietnam war ended, but this dispute was not connected to militarized rebels.
