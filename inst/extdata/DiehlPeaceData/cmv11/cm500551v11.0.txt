CIVWARMID: MID1382 1 -- civil war 
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1382 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1382 from Gibler 2018, domestic unrest in Uganda led Amin to accuse Tanzania, Sudan, and Zambia of preparing to invade Uganda in 1974. Tanzania and Uganda then amassed troops on the border, and Uganda threatened the aforementioned countries with military force should they invade. From New York Times 11/11/1974, part of this unrest involved a small group of Ugandan troops that rebelled against the rest of the military and the regime due to a lack of pay and food. The rebellion was quickly put down. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved troops in the military rebelling against the regime; these are organized, militarized rebels. 

CIVWARLINK: MID1382 3 -- not civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1382 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: 

COUPMID: MID1382 3 -- not coup 
COUPMID-CER: MID1382 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: MID1382 Coded not coup because the troops that rebelled were not military elites mounting a leadership coup; they were low-level soldiers. They rebelled due to no pay and low food. 

COUPLINK: MID1382 3 -- not coup link
COUPLINK-CER: MID1382 1 -- certain
