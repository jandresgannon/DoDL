Russia protested to Argentina regarding the shelling of a Russian fishing vessel by the Argentinian coast guard. The incident occurred on 6/13/2002. Argentine forces believed that the vessel was violating their waters, but the Russian crew considered themselves to be in international waters. The Argentines opened fire when the Russian vessel refused to show its catch. Russia took particular issue with the lack of warning shots by Argentine forces. First day of dispute is listed on 8/6/2002 and last day of dispute is listed on 8/6/2002.
