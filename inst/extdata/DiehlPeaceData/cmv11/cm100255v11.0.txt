NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Colombia and Germany was due to German U-boat attacks on Colombian ships during the second World War. On November 26, 1943 a German U-boat sunk a Colombian schooner, marking the first of two German naval attacks on Colombian vessels, MID3886. The second occured on November 27, 1943, MID1789 and involved the sinking of a 120-ton Colombian ship. On November 27, 1943 Colombia declared itself in a state of beligerency against Germany, MID3517. This led to the internment of German nationals in Colombia on December 31, 1943. No further attacks occured against Colombian vessels after 1943, leading to the end of the rivalry with the defeat of Germany and its unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945.
