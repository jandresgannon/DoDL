NARRATIVE-CR:
In 1839 the Turks attempted to conquer Syria (MID217). Syria dominated the Turks early on, but several European powers came to the rescue of Turkey. Britain and Austria dispatched ships and landing forces to bombard Egyptian and Albanian forces (Clodfelter 1992). France had lent troop support to Mohammed Ali but by November 27th of 1840 Ali had agreed to give back Syria and return the Sultan's fleet. 

A decade later Austria and France were both caught up in the Italian Revolutions of 1848 (MID374). In the summer of 1848 Venice and Rome declared themselves independent republics, France lent troop support to the Vatican in order to put down these revolutions (Clodfelter 1992). Although both Austria and France opposed the new republics the French did not support the Austrian control over the Italian state. 

Later in the revolution France lent its support to the Sardinian forces under Emmanuel II (MID115 the War of Italian Unification). The Sardinians directly opposed Austrian rule in Italy (Clodfelter 1992). On May 20th of 1859 French forces engaged Austrian forces at Montebello. In June a massive battle occurred between French and Austrian forces at Solferino. The issue of Italian unification was settled at the Conference of Villafranca where an independent and sovereign Italian government was established. 

The Spezzia Crisis (MID212) was a single day dispute in March of 1880 and appears to have been a minor issue in which no particular issue was at stake between Austria and France. Relations between France and Austria-Hungary went fairly unchanged from 1890 until 1914. The Austro-German Treaty which was signed in 1879 remained in effect until 1918 and enabled a unified anti-Russian stance by both Germany and Austria-Hungary (Nicolson 2001). In 1914 Germany called upon the terms of the alliance and requested Austria-Hungarian support in combating Allied forces. 

The final dispute between France and Austria-Hungary in 1914 was part of the larger issue of the First World War (MID257). Although the dispute is coded as ending on November 11th of 1918 (the date of the armistice between Germany and the Allied Powers) the dispute effectively ended with the Treaty of Versailles which called for the dissection of the Austria-Hungarian Empire (Nicolson 2001). The Austro-Hungarian Empire was entirely dismantled, and a new nation of Czechoslovakia was formed. The state of Poland was revived with new borders, Bulgaria and Hungary were reduced in size, and Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became independent states (Clodfelter 1992). The financial demands of reparations in the armistice and the Treaty of Versailles mainly pertained to Germany. the dismantling of the Austria-Hungarian Empire effectively ended all issues between France in January of 1919.
