RIVALRY: RIV10073
DISPUTE(S): MID258 MID518 

RIVNOTES: Because MID1286 is Cold War-related it is split off from the World War~II rivalry. MID1286 does not involve Bulgaria versus the USA hence it is removed and the one-dispute RIV10074 is eliminated.

RIV10073: The end date of RIV10073 is 19440908. Bulgaria was a member of MID258 in two periods: 19411213-19440823 (when it was allied against US) and 19440906-19450507 (when it was allied with US), according to MIDB3.10 dataset. We record the end date of RIV10073 as 19440908 because that is the date when Bulgaria officially became an ally of US and Soviet Union in WWII.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The conflict between the US and Bulgaria begins with their mutual involvement in World War I. There were no other MIDs until World War II. The character of the rivalry is similar to that of the rivalries between the US and other Eastern European countries. It was a product of alliances in World War II and the Cold War occupation and influence of the USSR in Eastern Europe. There do not seem to be any direct issues between the two countries over which they might engage in open hostility directed at one another. 

MID257 is World War I. As World War I unfolded in the Balkans, the Bulgarian government-with their eyes on Macedonia-hoped to limit the amount of battle they engaged in but to gain territory. Pro-German King Ferdinand and Prime Minister Radoslav entered Bulgaria into the war on the side of the Central Powers, even though the general popular opinion was with Slavic relation Russia and its allies, Britain and France. Ferdinand eventually abdicated after a September 1918 army revolt and his son Boris III took control. After the terrible toll of the war itself, the Treaty of Neuilly in 1919 exacted a great deal from Bulgaria. Land was lost on all sides to Serbia, Romania and Greece, the army was restricted and huge war reparation payments were required. 

There are no MIDs again until the beginning of WWII and this first encounter does not constitute a rivalry according to the rivalry coding criteria. 

The period of rivalry according to the coding criteria starts in 1941 and ends in 1944. There are two MIDs during this period (MID258 and MID518), one is the Bulgarian declaration of war against the United States (MID518), the second is the war itself (MID258). A third MID, MID1286 took place in the Cold War period in 1951 and it is the Bulgarian involvement in the Soviet Yugoslavia rift. Therefore this rivalry is not a first order rivalry of the caliber of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. Instead, this is a rivalry due to alliance commitments and the Cold War alignment of countries. The Bulgarians and the Americans at no time have direct issues of conflict between them other than the declaration of war by the Bulgarians in 1941. 

MID258 is World War II and MID518 is the Bulgarian declaration of war against the US and the UK. With the start of World War II, Bulgaria was in a sticky position. It had just signed a treaty of "inviolable peace and friendship" with Serbia in 1937. Yet Germany by then had strong economic ties in the area, and with promises from the Reich of gaining back the ever-desirable Macedonian lands, Bulgaria reluctantly sided with the Axis powers in 1941. To avoid a revolt by the people, King Boris III refused to sign a declaration of war on the Soviets, and the Bulgarians avoided conflict with their traditional Slav allies for the duration of the war. Although he managed to resist Nazi pressure on that issue, Boris did die mysteriously after visiting Berlin in August 1943. He left behind a son, Simeon II, aged six, and a Council of Regency to rule in his stead. 

Heavy Allied bombing raids destroyed much of Sofia in 1943-44, which served to increase the general anti-war and especially anti-Nazi sentiment. After declaring itself neutral and disarming locally stationed German soldiers, Bulgarians allowed the Red Army to pass its northern borders unopposed on September 8, 1944. The next day, a coalition of communist groups, which had been operating under the name of the Fatherland Front, took Sofia and then the rest of Bulgaria, and September 9 was deemed Liberation Day. 

MID1286 occurred from August of 1949 through November of 1951. This MID is titled `Yugoslavia vs. Cominform countries.' It is covers the rift in relations between the USSR and Yugoslavia. It pits Yugoslavia and the US v. the USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The central combatants here were the USSR and Yugoslavia. This event is also described as the Yugoslav-Soviet Rift. In this mid Stalin feared that he was losing his grip on Eastern Europe and in 1947 ordered creation of a Soviet-dominated socialist bloc. In 1947, the Soviet, East European, Italian, and French communist parties founded the Cominform (Communist Information Bureau). Stalin saw the independent Communists in Yugoslavia as a direct threat. There were other precursors to antagonism including Stalin's wartime objections to Yugoslavian Communist political initiative, his refusal to provide aid to the Communist movement in Yugoslavia, and Red Army looting and raping in Yugoslavia in 1944 and 1945. There were also issues regarding Yugoslavia resistance to participation in Soviet economic schemes that would have had a one way beneficiary relationship towards Moscow. After a series of escalatory steps the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia and called on Yugoslav communists to overthrow Tito. At first the Yugoslav communists and Tito responded in a conciliatory fashion. Yugoslavs supported Soviet foreign policy and implemented Stalinist economic measures. However, collectivization proved disastrous as agricultural output decreased and coercive tactics used by the regime eroded support for the government. Yugoslav relations with the West in 1949 were also in a poor state as there were lingering issues with Italy over Trieste and issues with various countries over nationalized property within Yugoslavia. The Soviet-bloc governments launched an economic blockade against Yugoslavia, excluding it from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CEMA). The Soviets propagandized harshly against "Judas" Tito in Serbo-Croatian broadcasts, attempted to subvert Yugoslav party organizations, and sought to incite unrest among the Hungarian, Albanian, and Russian minorities in Yugoslavia. Troop movements and border incidents convinced Yugoslav leaders that a Soviet-bloc invasion was imminent, requiring fundamental changes in foreign policy. In July 1949, Tito closed the Yugoslav-Greek border and ceased supplying the pro-Cominform Greek communists, and in August Yugoslav votes in the United Nations began to stray from the Soviet line. Welcoming the Yugoslav-Soviet rift, the West commenced a flow of economic aid in 1949, saved the country from hunger in 1950, and covered much of Yugoslavia's trade deficit for the next decade. The United States began shipping weapons to Yugoslavia in 1951. A military security arrangement was concluded in 1953, but the Western powers were unable to bring Yugoslavia into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). During the mid their were minor skirmishes on the border and a US cargo aircraft carrying supplies to Yugoslavia was forced to land in Hungary but subsequently allowed to proceed. 

From World War II until 1989, Bulgarian foreign policy revolved around the Soviet Union. Without exception Sofia imitated or supported Soviet twists and turns such as Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Substantial historical and economic ties supplemented the ideological foundation of the relationship. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bulgaria improved its diplomatic relations with nations outside the Soviet sphere. But in 1989, domestic and international events jolted Bulgaria from forty years of uniformity and forced it to consider for the first time major diversification of its foreign policy, abandoning its paramount reliance on the Soviet Union. This meant a lengthy period of reevaluation, during which general goals were agreed upon but specific policy was hotly debated. 

The death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 had strong repercussions in Bulgaria. By that time, Chervenkov had already moved slightly away from hard-line Stalinist domestic repression and international isolation, but the lack of clear ideological guidance from post-Stalin Moscow left him in an insecure position. In 1953 Bulgaria resumed relations with Greece and Yugoslavia, some political amnesties were granted, and planners discussed increasing production of consumer goods and reducing the prices of necessities. At the Sixth Party Congress in 1954, Chervenkov gave up his party leadership but retained his position as prime minister. Todor Zhivkov, leader of the postwar generation of Bulgarian communist leaders, assumed the newly created position of first secretary of the party Central Committee. Several purged party leaders were released from labor camps, and some resumed visible roles in the party hierarchy. 

In spite of the 1954 party shifts, Chervenkov remained the unchallenged leader of Bulgaria for two more years. The economic shift away from heavy industry toward consumer goods continued in the mid-1950s, and direct Soviet intervention in Bulgarian economic and political life diminished. By 1955, some 10,000 political prisoners had been released. In an attempt to win political support from the peasants, Chervenkov eased the pace of collectivization and increased national investment in agriculture. 

In the 1960s the Johnson Administration had difficulties building bridges to Bulgaria. The Johnson Administration had a general plan of developing relations with the Eastern European countries independent of the Soviet Union. This was a difficult task with Bulgaria. Faced with a government that sought trade benefits while simultaneously unleashing mobs to attack U.S. diplomatic facilities, the Johnson administration insisted on linking economic concessions to overall Bulgarian behavior. The Bulgarians attempted to decouple these issues. The result was slow progress. The two states raised their level of diplomatic exchange to embassies, but the never robust relationship withered when Bulgaria cooperated with the Soviet Union in repressing Czechoslovakian reform Communists.

19440909-19511124 Transition

After declaring itself neutral and disarming locally stationed German soldiers, Bulgarians allowed the Red Army to pass its northern borders unopposed on September 8, 1944. The next day, a coalition of communist groups, which had been operating under the name of the Fatherland Front, took Sofia and then the rest of Bulgaria, and September 9, 1944, was deemed Liberation Day. Thus, Bulgaria became an ally with U.S., U.K. and Soviet Union in the war against Germany. Bulgaria was a member of MID258-World War II in two periods: 19411213-19440823 (when it was allied against US) and 19440906-19450507 (when it was allied with US), according to MIDB3.10 dataset. We record the end date of RIV10073 as 19440908 because that is the date when Bulgaria officially became an ally of US and Soviet Union in WWII. However, soon afterwards with the beginning of the Cold War, Bulgaria and U.S. found themselves in different alliances again.

On September 30, 1947, U.S. appointed a diplomatic representative to Sofia, Mr. Donald Heath, but he was declared persona non-grata by the Bulgarian authorities on January 19, 1950. In February 1950, U.S. stopped its diplomatic relations with Bulgaria over allegations of espionage raised against the American diplomatic staff in Sofia.

MID1286 occurred from August of 1949 through November of 1951. This MID is titled `Yugoslavia vs. Cominform countries.' It is covers the rift in relations between the USSR and Yugoslavia. It pits Yugoslavia and the US v. the USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. The central combatants here were the USSR and Yugoslavia. This event is also described as the Yugoslav-Soviet Rift. In this mid Stalin feared that he was losing his grip on Eastern Europe and in 1947 ordered creation of a Soviet-dominated socialist bloc. The last MID between U.S. and Bulgaria, MID1286 ended on November 24, 1951.

In an attempt to win political support from the peasants, Chervenkov eased the pace of collectivization and increased national investment in agriculture.

Todor Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, in an interview on September 22, 1957 called for resumption of normal diplomatic relations with United States. On March 27, 1959, U.S. restored diplomatic relations with Bulgaria that were stopped in February 1950 due to Stalinist-type purges in that country and accusations of espionage raised against U.S. diplomats. During that time the U.S. diplomatic staff was accused of espionage.

In July 1961 an Israeli commercial airline was shot down over Bulgaria, and 12 U.S. citizens lost their lives. U.S. Government officially complained to the Bulgarian government over the incident. Throughout the early 1960s Bulgaria periodically criticized the U.S. government and occasionally let its citizens to attack the U.S. diplomatic headquarters in Sofia. On October 7, 1966, U.S. President Johnson included Bulgaria on a list of East European Communist states that could receive lower economic tariffs for their products sold on the American market. U.S. raised its diplomatic relations with Bulgaria to the ambassadorial level. The move was keeping with U.S. President Johnson's desire to improve relations with Eastern European Communist states.

On September 25, 1974, United States and Bulgaria signed an agreement establishing a new U.S.-Bulgarian economic council to promote trade. The highest-ranking Bulgarian official ever to visit U.S. was Deputy Prime Minister, Popov in 1974, when he toured U.S. for 2 weeks. In 1975, a Bulgarian diplomat said that Bulgaria's foreign policy problems with U.S. are due to the closeness that exists between Bulgarian and Soviet foreign policies. Secondly, he added that he hopes to see an increase in trade between U.S. and Bulgaria and the signing of some cultural, technological and informational agreements between the two countries. In June 1977, a cultural, scientific and technical cooperation was signed between the two countries. The Carter administration has reached an agreement with Bulgaria in November 1977, on removing travel restrictions on their respective diplomats. This left the Soviet Union as the only Warsaw Pact country that continues to maintain a travel control system created during the Cold War period. The American action was designed in part to demonstrate U.S. compliance with the 1975 Helsinki agreement on security and cooperation in Europe. At the same time, Bulgaria has indicated willingness for the first time to begin negotiations on the settlement of about $15 million in pre-World War II Bulgarian bonds held by U.S. citizens. U.S. officials said the talks are expected to begin in December or in January. The Bulgarian bonds were floated in U.S. capital markets in 1929, but the post-war Communist government of Bulgaria had so far refused to recognize any obligations of the old government. In February 1978, Bulgaria has concluded with the United States an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation during a visit paid to the United States by Nacho Papazov, chairman of the Bulgarian state committee on science and technological progress.

In the 1980s, Bulgaria was as a Communist country as Soviet Union, one of the Communist countries that most respected Moscow's decisions. Unlike their Communist neighbors, Romania and Hungary, they did not apply for the most-favored-nation status in front of the U.S. Congress, but still wanted to improve their economic relations with U.S.

In May 1986 the two countries established a cooperation agreement in the area of narcotics traffic. On August 30, 1989, the U.S. State Department denounced Bulgaria's treatment of its Turkish minority and announced that U.S. Ambassador Sol Polansky has been called home in a gesture of disapproval. 

19891108-19911028 Transition

On November 8, 1989, Bulgaria's Politburo changed its leader, long-standing dictator Todor Zhivkov. That signaled the start of the collapse of Communism in Bulgaria. In June 1990, the U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria was seriously concerned about the freedom of the first multi-party elections in Bulgaria since World War II. In October 1990, U.S. and Bulgaria announced reaching an accord on economic cooperation. Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev visited the United States and had talks with U.S. President George H. W. Bush in 1990, followed by the official visit to Sofia by U.S. Vice-President Dan Quayle.

On October 29, 1991, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to normalize trade relations with Bulgaria and dramatically reduce tariffs on their exports to the United States. On a pair of votes, the House approved trade agreements negotiated with the two countries last January after Bulgaria overthrew its communist government. On November 13, 1991, U.S. President Bush signed a resolution granting trade privileges to Bulgaria as a reward for its moves toward a democratic system and a free-market economy. The resolution, approved by the U.S. Congress, gives Bulgaria most-favored-nation trade status, allowing it to sell goods to the United States at the lowest possible tariffs under terms of a bilateral trade agreement. The American University in Bulgaria was founded in 1991, with assistance from the United States Government, to provide a liberal arts education to students from Bulgaria and other Balkan countries. Peace Corps Volunteers began to arrive in Bulgaria to teach English and aid in community development, and a Fulbright Program Commission was created to establish university exchanges.

In 1996, President Bill Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit Bulgaria. U.S. President Clinton and Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov met at the White House on February 12,1998, to discuss the strengthening of U.S.-Bulgarian relations as well as mutual efforts to enhance cooperation in Southeast Europe and advance Bulgaria's integration into the European and transatlantic communities, including NATO. President Clinton noted the historic changes that have taken place in Bulgaria over the last year and the key role played by President Stoyanov. During his tenure, Stoyanov's Bulgaria has aligned itself firmly with the family of democratic nations, moved forward with difficult economic reforms, strengthened its civic institutions, stepped up its fight against organized crime and enhanced cooperation with its neighbors. The two presidents committed themselves to building a partnership that reflects a new era in Bulgarian-American relations. President Clinton reaffirmed America's commitment to NATO's "Open Door" policy and welcomed Bulgaria's aspiration to NATO membership. The two Presidents agreed that Bulgaria's engagement in the Partnership for Peace, enhanced dialogue with NATO and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council were key tools to making Bulgaria the strongest possible candidate for NATO membership. The centerpiece of the visit was the announcement of a new U.S. Action Plan for Southeast Europe. The Action Plan will give further dynamism to U.S. cooperation with countries in the region in such areas as promoting peaceful resolution of disputes, combating organized crime and consolidating democratic and economic reforms. President Stoyanov expressed full support for the Action Plan and committed Bulgaria to doing its part. On the military front, the U.S. Department of Defense has developed a number of programs to support the reform of the Bulgarian military along Western lines, including for this year: A $900,000 International Military Education and Training program that has eleven Bulgarian cadets studying at U.S. military academies. U.S. President Bill Clinton promised in Sofia on November 22, 1999, the support of the United States for "Bulgaria's integration in the political, economic and military structures of the West". Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov and Prime Minister Ivan Kostov stressed in talks with Clinton their country's determination to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Stoyanov also offered to place Bulgaria's infrastructure and military facilities at the disposal of NATO forces, Bulgarian state radio reported. Should the question of setting up military bases arise before Bulgaria became a NATO member, then Sofia should give a positive response, Stoyanov said. Stoyanov underlined Bulgaria's hopes of joining the Western alliance in the second wave of its eastward expansion. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were the first three former Warsaw Pact countries to join the alliance in the first wave in March this year.

Bulgaria's foreign minister revealed on September 25, 2001, that Bulgaria will allow the United States to use the Balkan country's air space for anti-terrorist operations.

On November 21-22, 2002, at the Prague Summit, Bulgaria was offered membership to NATO. Bulgaria joined NATO on January 1, 2004. Bulgaria signed an agreement with the United States on April 4, 2003, for the deployment to the Gulf region of a 97-member military unit for protection against chemical and biological weapons. Bulgaria is expecting at least 20 million dollars in US aid in connection with its participation in the coalition against Iraq. Khristo Kirchev MP of the United Democratic Forces broke the news Monday April 7, 2003, emerging from a meeting with Foreign Minister Solomon Pasi. Kirchev and other members of the four National Assembly factions are leaving for the United States for a series of meetings at the Senate and Congress. Bulgaria contributed to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq with 485 soldiers. They were withdrawn in 2005, to be replaced by a unit of about 190 non-combat troops in 2006.

In May 2003, US Secretary of State Colin Powell told a joint news conference with Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, that Bulgaria is playing a major role in modern Transatlantic processes. Powell recalled that last week the US Senate ratified Bulgaria's NATO accession protocol. The US secretary of state promised support to Bulgaria in its fight against corruption, the reform in its judiciary and in encouraging economic growth. Bulgaria has always stood by the United States in the fight against terrorism and in the disarmament of Saddam Hussein, Powell said. He added that Bulgaria also supported the efforts of the UN Security Council in Afghanistan and send a Bulgarian contingent to Afghanistan. Powell recalled US President Bush's words that America does not forget its friends. Some 5,000 American troops were deployed on several military sites in Bulgaria and Romania in 2006 as part of a Pentagon plan to create new, flexible bases in Eastern Europe, a U.S. diplomat said. He estimated that 2,700 troops will be deployed in Bulgaria, while Romania will host around 2,300 troops, as well as the joint command of the whole unit. In Bulgaria, the troops will be deployed at the Bezmer air base and the Novo Selo training area in southeastern Bulgaria. Both sites have been chosen because of their convenient location close to the Black Sea port of Burgas. According to Levine, the Deputy U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria, the United States has provided Bulgaria since 1989 with military assistance worth US$100 million and some US$500 million in economic assistance. U.S. Secretary of State, Rice and her Bulgarian counterpart signed an agreement on April 28, 2006, allowing U.S. troops to be deployed in this former Warsaw Pact country. Under the 10-year deal, seen as part of a broader U.S. military strategy of shifting troops based in Europe farther east, up to 2,500 U.S. troops will be deployed in the Balkan country on a rotational basis. Rice, hailing the deal as "foundational" for the broad partnership with Bulgaria, signed the agreement along with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivailo Kalfin.
