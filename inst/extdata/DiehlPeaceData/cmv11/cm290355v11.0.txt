PS-UPDATE2020: Revision based on a new relationship rule that when a state exits a REI, the REI is the only basis for a relationship with a given other state, and the peace scale coding is not .5, then the relationship continues for 5 years and is coded as negative peace (.5) and then the relationship ends thereafter.

PSNOTES: Given joint membership in the EU and NATO, this relationship is given a 1.0 on the peace scale.
