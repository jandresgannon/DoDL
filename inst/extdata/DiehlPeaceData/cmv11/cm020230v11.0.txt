MARITMID-NOTES: MID4031 from cm narrative, this MID occurred 3/7/1995-4/16/1995 and involved a disagreement over fishing rights in the Grand Banks. The Canadians charged the Spanish with over-fishing and ignoring minimum size requirements. They responded by showing their Naval forces, boarding some boats, seizing others, and attacking one. The Spanish sent Naval ships to protect the fishing fleet. The dispute was eventually resolved through negotiations. Coded not maritime because the maritime boundary was not disputed, and this was an issue of overfishing and international commerce.

In March and April of 1995 Canada and Spain were involved in a number of militarized incidents over fishing rights in the Grand Banks. The Canadians charged the Spanish with over-fishing and ignoring minimum size requirements. They responded by showing their Naval forces, boarding some boats, seizing others, and attacking one. The Spanish sent Naval ships to protect the fishing fleet. The dispute was eventually resolved through negotiations. The settlement heavily favored the Canadians. First day of dispute was on 3/7/1995 and last day of dispute was on 4/16/1995.
