MARITMID-NOTES: MID2313 from NYT 12/26/1913, Spain deployed a warship to Mexican waters, triggering this MID. However, the NYT story describes Mexico as welcoming the Spanish ship; the Mexican president boarded the ship and invited those aboard to be special guests in the Mexican capital. Coded not maritime because Spain was not advancing a maritime claim here. Coded uncertain because it is doubtful that is actually a MID, as Mexico did not protest the deployment and appeared to welcome it.
