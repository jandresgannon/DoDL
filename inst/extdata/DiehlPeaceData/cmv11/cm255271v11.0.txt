NARRATIVE-CR:
The first dispute between Germany and Wurttemburg that occurred in the 19th century occurred in 1850 and was the result of the German revolutions of 1848 and attempted unification in 1850. However, the Austrian Empire, backed by France, Wurttemburg and Bavaria prevented German unification under the Prussian Empire with the Treaty of Olmutz on November 29th of 1850 (MID154). The treaty specified that Prussia must give up its separatist plans and that it must restore the old constitution of the German confederation (Williamson 1998). The next dispute was touched off by the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 (MID261). Bismark, having defeated Denmark in 1964, again pushing for German unification turned his Prussian army against Austria in 1866. Wurttemburg committed 7000 troops to support Austria in the war (Clodfelter 1992). However, Austria was soundly defeated and was forced to sign an armistice on July 26th (Clodfelter 1992). Austria was forced to give up any and all claims to Germany or Central Europe. The third and final dispute between the two countries occurred during the Franco-Prussian War (MID88). Again, the issue of German expansion was at the heart of the conflict. Wurttemburg committed 26,000 troops in support of France, but again the Prussian army was too much and in May of 1971 France was forced to cede Alsace and Lorraine to the newly united German Empire (Clodfelter 1992). In addition, France had to pay monetary reparations to Germany as well. With Germany now unified under the Prussians Wurttemburg's support for the continued federal system of Germany became moot and the rivalry ended with the Treaty of Franfurt on May 10th, 1871.
