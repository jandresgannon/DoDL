MARITMID-NOTES: MID1124 from cm RIVNOTES, a severe, near-war crisis occurred between Mexico and Guatemala in 1958. The MID-B data indicates that this is MID1124. Guatemala deployed airplanes when Mexican fishing vessels came very close to the Guatemalan coastline. The planes fired on some of the Mexican vessels, killing several fishermen. Both countries mobilized troops before the crisis was defused. Coded not maritime because the maritime border was not disputed; this was a fishing dispute that escalated.

Guatemala was fighting against a Leftist insurgency, and some rebels were seeking refuge across the Mexican border. Coded civil war MID because Guatemala crossed the Mexican border, triggering this MID, to attack militarized rebels who were fighting an insurgency against the Guatemalan government.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2350 from NYT 5/3/1984, Mexico announced that they would resettle 46,000 refugees away from the Mexican border. Guatemala had repeatedly crossed the Mexican border and attacked refugee camps in search of leftist insurgents. After repeatedly protesting the incursions by Guatemala, Mexico wanted to resettle the refugees away from the border in hopes that it would stop the raids. Coded civil war MID because the incursions by Guatemala were attempts to attack leftist rebels who were fighting an insurgency against the Guatemalan government.

RIVNOTES: very severe, near war crisis in 1958. On the afternoon of December 30, 1958, a group of Guatemalan AT-6 Texan aircraft surveyed the scene of the reported fishing to ensure the Mexican vessels were still there. The following morning, a flight of two P-51 Mustangs took off from the Guatemalan mainland and observed a group of eight Mexican fishing boats. Five of the eight were a mere 1.5-2 miles (2.4-3.2 km) off the coast of the Guatemalan municipality of Champerico. The fishermen responded to the arrival of the fighter-bombers with jeers and obscene gestures.When one boat, the Elizabeth, made a move for the Mexican border, the planes strafed the ships with their machine guns. By the time the shooting had ceased, three fishermen were left dead and fourteen were rendered stranded and wounded in Guatemalan territory
 Within days of the attack, both Mexican and Guatemalan troops were mobilized to the 541-mile (871 km) long Guatemala-Mexico border. Mexican forces tore down a bridge which connected the two countries upon the severing of connections with the Guatemalan government.
 On January 23, Mexican president Adolfo Lupez Mateos terminated diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guatemala
 On September 15, 1959, during a speech regarding the 149th anniversary of the commencement of the Mexican War of Independence, Adolfo Lopez Mateos announced that, through mediation on both sides, Guatemala and Mexico were reestablishing relations. Soon afterwards, Guatemala compensated the families of the injured and dead fishermen, and formally apologized for the incident
