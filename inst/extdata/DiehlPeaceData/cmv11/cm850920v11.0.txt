MID4265

TERRMID: MID4265 3 -- not territorial 
TERRMID-CER: MID4265 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTE: MID4265 no disputed territory in interstate dyad; at this time, any territorial dispute occurs between Indonesia and rebel groups (i.e., secessionist civil war).

TERRLINK: MID4265 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID4265 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTE: MID4265 From narrative, peacekeepers from New Zealand exchanged fire with Indonesian soldiers, killing one Indonesian soldier. UN peacekeepers were intervening in a conflict that centered on the independence of East Timor. The deceased Indonesian soldier was from a group against East Timor independence. Coded not TERRLINK because East Timor was not yet an independent state at the time of this dispute, so no official territorial dispute was present between East Timor and Indonesia, only between Indonesia and rebel groups such as Fretelin.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: The secessionist rebels opposing Indonesia from within East Timor were named Fretelin. From UCDP: “The combination of small-scale guerrilla warfare, civilian protests, and an active exiled lobby brought the conflict onto the international agenda in the late 1980s. Before this, the international interest for East Timor had remained lukewarm although the UN, in a number of resolutions, had condemned the Indonesian invasion. After intense lobbying by Portugal and exiled Timorese, the UN general assembly in 1983 gave the Secretary-General a specific mission to find a solution to the conflict. A line of events, such as the Santa Cruz massacre of 1991, the jailing of Gusmao in 1992 and the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the East Timorese independence leaders Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, finally gained the attention of the international community.

No direct negotiations took place between Fretilin and Indonesia. As a result of the financial crisis that struck Indonesia and the whole region in 1997, and the subsequent ousting of Suharto, Portugal and Indonesia undertook discussions regarding East Timor mediated by the UN. These talks led to the decision to let the Timorese people decide about East Timor’s future status in a referendum. A UN mission administered the referendum in August 1999 with 98.6% of the population participating, of which 78.6% voted for independence.

A UN-sanctioned regional peacekeeping force arrived in September, and on 31 October 1999 the last Indonesian soldiers left the territory, leaving behind a UN Transitional Administration already in control of the territory. Even though anti-independence militias were active throughout 1999 and early 2000 (see one-sided violence, government-civilians for more information about the large-scale violence against civilians in 1999), the transition followed the schedule and on 20 May 2002, Timor Lorosae became an independent state. Four months later, the state became a member of the United Nations. The former leader of FRETILIN, José Xanana Gusmao, now the head of the political party CNRT (National Congress for the Reconstruction of East Timor) which was the transformed CNRM (National Council of the Maubere Resistance), was elected the first President of the independent state.

The UN peacekeeping mission concluded on 20 May 2005, but a smaller contingent of about 275 international security and government advisors remained in the country.” (http://ucdp.uu.se/#/statebased/720)

CIVWARLINK: MID4265 3 -- not civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4265 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4265 the secessionist rebel group Fretilin was, at the time of this MID, within the territory of Indonesia, so the secessionist rebels were not involved in a civil war/insurgency outside of this dyad.

This dispute is related to the peace-keeping process in East Timor. An Indonesian soldier was shot dead in a gun battle with New Zealand troops, while the UN peace-keepers were boosting security along the border with Indonesia. It is understood from the reports that the shot Indonesian soldier was from the group against the independence of East Timor. He was out of uniform and fired at least two shots at the peace-keepers from the Indonesian side of the unmarked border, and was shot four times consequently. First and last day of dispute was on 7/28/2001.
