PS-UPDATE2020:Revision based on a new relationship rule that when a rivalry terminates and the rivalry is the only basis for a relationship, then the relationship continues for 5 years and is coded as negative peace (.5) and then the relationship ends thereafter.

PSNOTES: 

For the period of 19181111-19391104, the begin date was changed from 19181110 to 19181111 because the beginning day of this period was transposed with the ending date of the last period. Therefore, for period 19141030-19181110, end date was changed from 19181111 to 19181110. This was verified based on new republic signing the armistice on the 11th and all agreements/disputes with the former German government were dissolved in the eyes of the Swedish government (Roberts 1999 and Koblic 1972). This change was made from version 1.0 to 1.1 of the data.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Conflict arose between Germany and Sweden during the First World War over German expectations for Swedish cooperation and the fate of the Aland Islands. The MID number for the final confrontation between the two nations is 1774. The end of conflict in the first series of MIDs MID1477 coincides with the surrender of Germany to the allied powers (November 11th 1918). The two key players during WWI were King Gustav V for Sweden and Kaiser Wilhelm II for Germany (Koblic 1972 and Roberts 1999). Although Sweden had declared itself neutral at this point in history, Germany exacted concessions and pro-German policy through the use of threats and intimidation. The MIDs represent the occasions on which Germany asserted its influence over Sweden. 

Sweden had taken the Aland Islands during the Napoleonic Wars because of the strategic value they held. The Balkan islands provide a strong offensive front against Russia. It is for this reason that both Germany and Russia desired possession of the Aland Islands during WWI (Malmborg 2001). By 1914 Sweden feared that Russia was going to launch an offensive to take the entire Balkan region, which shifted Swedish Neutrality to favor German collaboration. Sweden's interests in Germany included the postwar fate of the Aland Islands (Sweden wished to retain possession) and its economic relationship with Germany (Koblic 1972 and Malmborg 2001). 

Sweden supplied Germany with iron ore, oils and paper products and Germany supplied Sweden with its coal needs (Koblic 1972). This relationship gave the Allied powers the opinion that Sweden's neutrality was not sincere and that it was trying to play both sides of the conflict. By November of 1917 the Allied powers secured and agreement with Sweden that reduced the volume of trade with Germany and set strict limits concerning the type of relations Sweden could conduct with Germany. In April of 1918 Swedish representative Eric Trolle went to Berlin and secured an agreement with Germany for the reduction of trade. In the event of a German victory Sweden promised to recognize German command in the Balkans and to leave the discussion for possession of the Aland Islands open. This agreement was accepted in May 5 days later and an agreement with the Western powers was signed instead (Koblic 1972). Sweden had hoped that neither side would find out about the agreements with the other side.

The periods of dispute over trade and land division ended by November of 1918 when the Kaiser abdicated his thrown to a new Republic. The new republic signed the armistice on the 11th and all agreements/disputes with the former German government were dissolved in the eyes of the Swedish government (Roberts 1999 and Koblic 1972).

The second grouping of MIDs coincides with World War II. The key player for Sweden was still King Gustav V and Germany was under the control of Adolf Hitler. The MID number for the last conflict in the group is MID3806. Swedish support of German war activities was stronger during this second war because of previous disputes with the Soviets over control of the Aland Islands. In addition to fear of Soviet invasion, Finland was cooperating with Germany and Sweden had a long-standing friendship with Finland. Although Sweden remained officially neutral, Germany did exact several concessions with more vigor and force then during the First World War (Malmborg 2001). 

In June of 1940 Germany forced the Swedish government to allow German troop transport through its territory to reinforce its Finnish troops (Malmborg 2001). This was in violation of the Hague convention and constituted a breach in Sweden's promise of neutrality (Gihl 1943). Sweden later claimed that because of German promise of military invasion if they refused these concessions that they were left with no choice but cooperation. By June of 1941 Sweden further breached its neutrality by transporting German forces from Norway to Finland (Malmborg 2001). Although, Germany did make it clear that a rejection of this request would be taken as an act of hostility and be met with force.

The Swedish cooperation with Nazi Germany came to a close in 1943 when it became clear that the Allies were gaining the advantage and that Sweden was no longer in imminent danger from invasion. On July 29th the Swedish government annulled the treaties signed allowing troop transport and ceased the export of iron and ammunition on June 6th of 1944. This was the termination of relations between the Swedish government and the German National Socialist party headed by Hitler. During that same month Sweden dismissed all of its pro-German officers (such as its commander-in-chief Olof Thornell and other high ranking officials) and replaced them with pro-Western counterparts beginning the new era of pro-Western neutrality (Malmborg 2001).
