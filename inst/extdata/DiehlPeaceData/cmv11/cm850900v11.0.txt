Territorial-Maritime-Boundary Issues Variables

MID4264

TERRMID: MID4264 3 -- not territorial
TERRMID-CER: MID4264 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4264 no disputed territory in dyad; disputed territory is between Indonesia and East Timor, so although this was a MID that is connected to disputed territory, Australia is not considered to be initiating or receiving a territorial MID.

TERRLINK: MID4264 1 -- linked to territorial dispute
TERRLINK-CER: MID4264 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4264 involved shows of force between Indonesian military and Australian peacekeepers at the beginning of the UN peacekeeping mission. This mission took place following the East Timor referendum in which over 3/4 of Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. Although the referendum eventually led to the resolution of the territorial dispute (the vote was in August 1999), independence was not official until 2002. Thus, this MID occured before the territorial issue was officially resolved. (http://ucdp.uu.se/#/conflict/330)

CIVWARMID: MID4264 1 -- civil war
CIVWARMID-CER: MID4264 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4264 Involved territorial dispute that was associated with civil war between government of Indonesia and FETELIN, a secessionist rebel group for Timorese independence. From UCDP: “The combination of small-scale guerrilla warfare, civilian protests, and an active exiled lobby brought the conflict onto the international agenda in the late 1980s. Before this, the international interest for East Timor had remained lukewarm although the UN, in a number of resolutions, had condemned the Indonesian invasion. After intense lobbying by Portugal and exiled Timorese, the UN general assembly in 1983 gave the Secretary-General a specific mission to find a solution to the conflict. A line of events, such as the Santa Cruz massacre of 1991, the jailing of Gusmao in 1992 and the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the East Timorese independence leaders Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, finally gained the attention of the international community.

No direct negotiations took place between Fretilin and Indonesia. As a result of the financial crisis that struck Indonesia and the whole region in 1997, and the subsequent ousting of Suharto, Portugal and Indonesia undertook discussions regarding East Timor mediated by the UN. These talks led to the decision to let the Timorese people decide about East Timor’s future status in a referendum. A UN mission administered the referendum in August 1999 with 98.6% of the population participating, of which 78.6% voted for independence.

A UN-sanctioned regional peacekeeping force arrived in September, and on 31 October 1999 the last Indonesian soldiers left the territory, leaving behind a UN Transitional Administration already in control of the territory. Even though anti-independence militias were active throughout 1999 and early 2000 (see one-sided violence, government-civilians for more information about the large-scale violence against civilians in 1999), the transition followed the schedule and on 20 May 2002, Timor Lorosae became an independent state. Four months later, the state became a member of the United Nations. The former leader of FRETILIN, José Xanana Gusmao, now the head of the political party CNRT (National Congress for the Reconstruction of East Timor) which was the transformed CNRM (National Council of the Maubere Resistance), was elected the first President of the independent state.

The UN peacekeeping mission concluded on 20 May 2005, but a smaller contingent of about 275 international security and government advisors remained in the country.” (http://ucdp.uu.se/#/statebased/720)

CIVWARLINK: MID4264 3 -- not civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4264 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4264 coded not civil war link because the civi war was within this dyad, in Indonesia. The events in the civil war in Indonesia drove the clashes between Australia and Indonesia, so this is directly a CIVWARMID rather than a third party linked to it.

This dispute is related to peace-keeping operations in East Timor. The Australian-led Interfet force sent to East Timor in September 1999 faced "aggressive probing" from Indonesian aircraft and submarines. Consequently, Australian-led warships and combat jets were on strip alert for the first two weeks of the East Timor military operation. First day of dispute was on 9/12/1999 and last day of dispute was on 9/26/1999.
