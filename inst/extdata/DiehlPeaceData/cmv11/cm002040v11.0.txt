RIVNOTES: 
Two rivalries were combined to form RIV10002, MID1652 MID1665 and MID1677, even though the time density criteria were not met. This is because dispute MID1677 was quite similar to its predecessors in that the US responded to instability in Cuba in the context of a protectorate arrangement facilitated by the Platt Amendment.

PS-UPDATE2020: remains a lesser rivalry, even as relations take a step back under Trump. Major issues of disagreement are internal and not at the severe level that characterized Cuban ties to the USSR and Cuban forces in other countries previously.

MID1652

TERRMID: MID1652 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1652 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1652 from cm narrative, the US had occupied and intervened in Cuban affairs for several years prior to this MID out of its own economic interests. These economic interests became tied to political interests as the US did not want to see anti-US politicians take power and possibly risk US financial assets in Cuba. MID1652 is a threat of military intervention by the US if Cuba's government could not maintain order over labor union activity and general domestic protests, which the US perceived to be threatening to US assets in Cuba. Coded not territorial because although a threat of intervention was made, no claim on Cuban territory was present.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1677 from cm narrative, the President of Cuba fled into exile due to mounting pressure from domestic protests, US, and other international actors. The US helped set up a provisional government but this was soon overthrown by soldiers in the Cuban military. The US continued to exert political and economic pressure on Cuba after these events. Coded not territorial because no claim on Cuban territory was made by the US.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1742 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1742 from MID-B data, this MID occurred 1/14/1959. From NYT 1/16/1959, Fidel Castro threatened the US, saying that if the US intervened in Cuba following the overthrow of Batista, the US "can land the Marines and then there will be 200,000 Gringos dead." Castro went on to criticize the US for supporting Batista during the Cuban Revolution. Coded not civil war MID because while the outcome of the Cuban Revolution did mean that a non-US friendly regime was in power in Cuba, the events of the civil war itself did not produce this MID.

TERRMID: MID246 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID246 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID246 from cm narrative, MID246 is the Bay of Pigs invasion. The US sent US-trained Cuban exiles into Cuba in an attempt to overthrow the government. The Cuban government easily defeated them, and the attempted invasion caused increased hostilities between the US and Cuba and Russia. Coded not territory because the attempted invasion was intended to change political leadership in Cuba, and was not a claim on Cuban territory. 

TERRLINK: MID246 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID246 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID246 The US-Cuba dispute triggered a MID between the US and Russia here as well, but this was not a territorial MID and thus not a link to territory between US and Russia.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID246 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID246 coded not civil war MID because this was a military invasion by US-trained soldiers who had become US citizens. (The US had a policy of granting citizenship to Cuban exiles and refugees.) This was not a militarized rebel group fighting from within Cuba against the government.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID61 From MID-B data, this MID occurred in 1962 and also involves Russia. It is the only MID that occurs in this date range. This MID also follows MID246 which was the Bay of Pig invasion, which lines up temporally with this MID being the Cuban Missile Crisis. The US and Russia exchanged warnings and threats over a period of 13 days when it was discovered that Russia planned to install nuclear warheads in Cuba to deter future invasion attempts by the US. The US implemented a naval blockade of Cuba as well. (US State Dept. Office of the Historian.) Coded not territory because the US and Cuba did not dispute territory, and this was an issue of nuclear weapons presence close to the US mainland.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID2946 from MID-B data, this MID has a date range 2/24/1971-7/6/1971. From NYT Historical Archives, it was reported March 7, 1971 that the US detained 4 Cuban fishing boats, and Cuba responded by detaining American fishing boats a few months later, reported 6/11/1971. In these incidents, the US seized Cuban fishing boats 65 miles off the coast of Key West, and Cuba responded by seizing US fishing boats in retaliation for the jailing of the Cuban fishermen. This was known as the "Cuban Mackerel Crisis." Coded not maritime because the countries did not dispute the maritime boundary.

From NYT Historical Archive 12/18/1971, the US warned Cuba against attacking any more US ships in the Caribbean. The US denounced Cuba's actions, and Cuba had attacked and/or seized ships repeatedly in December. Cuba claimed they were pirate ships. Coded not maritime because the maritime boundary was not disputed between US and Cuba.

On 2/25/1974, the NYT reported that a plane carrying American missionaries was forced down in Cuba and held until the US guaranteed payment of over $6000 to Cuba in exchange for its release. Coded not territory because the border was not disputed, and this was a financial issue that probably occurred due to generally high communist/anti-communist tensions between the countries.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2958 from MID-B data, this MID has date 1/7/1976. From Facts on File (vol. XXXVI pg. 52), a civil war in Angola began in 1975 with the US supporting the FNLA and Cuba supporting the MPLA. Cuba criticized the US for recruiting Cuban exiles in Miami to fight in Angola, and the US announced that Cuba's intervention in Angola had ruined any chances for normal relations between the countries. Coded civil war link because US and Cuba were drawn into this MID via the Angolan Civil War, outside of this dyad.

Soviet troops in Cuba engaged in military exercises as a display of force toward the US.

COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3058 from MID-B data, this is a multilateral MID involving USA, Cuba, Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua & Barbuda, and Grenada. Date range 10/25/1983-11/1/1983. From Facts on File (vol. XLIII pg. 787), this is connected to the coup in Grenada. A coup in 1983 led the US to invade Grenada to take several Americans back to the US in the midst of the political turmoil. Cuba, a supporter of the new government, condemned the US for invading Grenada. Many Caribbean leaders condemned the coup and said they would not have relations with the new government, pulling them into this MID against Cuba. Coded coup link because a coup in Grenada, outside of this dyad, leads to a MID between the US and Cuba here.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The United States leased Guantanamo Bay from Cuba for use as a naval and coaling base on May 22, 1903. President Tomas Estrada Palma was re-elected president of Cuba on December 1, 1905, and he was inaugurated for his second term on May 20, 1906. Members of the *Liberal Party* (PL) led by Faustino Guerra rebelled against the government of President Estrada Palma in Pinar del Rio province on August 16, 1906. President Estrada Palma requested the deployment of United States warships to Cuba on September 8, 1906, and the USS *Denver* was deployed in the Havana harbor on September 12, 1906. The US deployed some 125 troops in Havana on September 13, 1906, but the troops were withdrawn offshore on September 14, 1906. President Theodore Roosevelt of the US sent William Taft and Robert Bacon to mediate in the dispute on September 17, 1906. President Estrada Palma resigned after the failure of US mediation on September 28, 1906. US troops intervened and occupied the island on September 28, 1906, and William Taft established a provisional government on September 29, 1906. Charles Magoon was appointed as head of the provisional government on October 6, 1906, and some 6,600 US troops were deployed in Cuba. Presidential elections were held on November 14, 1908, and Jose Miguel Gomez of the PL was elected president. Jose Miguel Gomez was inaugurated as president on January 28, 1909. US troops completed their withdrawal from Cuba on April 1, 1909. Mario Garcia Menocal of the *Conservative Party* (PC) was elected president in 1916, but the PL claimed election fraud. The PL led by Jose Miguel Gomez rebelled against the government on February 9, 1917. Some 3,000 US troops were deployed in support of the government between March 8, 1917 and 1922. 

The United States again sends troops to Cuba in 1933 during government instability and military coups.

On June 23, 1960, Prime Minister Fidel Castro of Cuba threatened to respond to "economic aggression" by the US with the seizure of all American-owned property and business interests in Cuba. President Dwight Eisenhower of the US imposed economic sanctions (reduction in sugar quota) against Cuba on July 6, 1960. President Eisenhower announced on July 9, 1960 that the US would not allow the establishment in the Western Hemisphere of a communist regime. The Cuban government nationalized banks and large industries on October 14, 1960, and the US imposed further economic sanctions (trade embargo) against Cuba on October 19, 1960. The US alleged that Cuba was receiving military assistance from the Soviet Union. The US referred the matter to the *Organization of American States* (OAS) Permanent Council on October 28, 1960. Some 17,000 Soviet soldiers had been deployed in Cuba. President Dwight Eisenhower warned Cuba on November 1, 1960 against a military takeover of the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay. Cuba complained about US military aggression and referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council on December 31, 1960. The US severed diplomatic relations with Cuba on January 3, 1961 after Castro demanded that the US reduce its embassy personnel in Havana to eleven diplomats. The UN Security Council discussed the Cuban complaint against the US on January 4-5, 1961. The opposition groups, the *Democratic Front* and the *Revolutionary Movement of the People,* established the *National Revolutionary Council* (NRC) headed by Jose Miro Cardona in New York City on March 21, 1961. The NRC urged Cubans to rebel against the government of Fidel Castro on April 9, 1961. Some 1,500 Cubans exiles, trained by the US *Central Intelligence Agency* (CIA) in Guatemala, invaded southern Cuba near *Bahia de los Cochinos* (Bay of Pigs) on April 17-20, 1961. Cuba referred the matter to the UN General Assembly on April 17, 1961. The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on April 18, 1961 calling on UN members to take necessary actions to reduce tensions in the area. The Cuban exile invasion at the Bay of Pigs failed as a result of inadequate air and naval support. Some 115 Cuban exiles were killed during the invasion, and another 1,200 were captured by Cuban troops. Several hundred Cuban soldiers were killed during the rebel invasion. Prime Minister Castro declared *Socialist Republic of Cuba *on May 1, 1961. The US imposed economic sanctions (trade embargo) against Cuba on February 3, 1962. The Soviet Union expressed support for Cuba and condemned the US on February 18, 1962. The Soviet Union decided to provide military assistance (weapons and advisors) to Cuba on September 2, 1962. The Soviet Union condemned US aggression against Cuba on September 11, 1962. On October 10, 1962, the US agreed to pay $60 million to Cuba for 1,113 prisoners resulting from the Bay of Pigs invasion. President John Kennedy of the US accused the Soviet Union on October 22, 1962 of deploying nuclear missiles in Cuba, and he ordered an air and naval blockade of Cuba beginning on October 24, 1962. Cuba, the US, and the Soviet Union requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on October 22-23, 1962. The OAS authorized the use of military force to enforce the blockade on October 23, 1962. Italy and Britain expressed support for the US on October 23, 1962. UN Secretary-General U Thant appealed for peaceful negotiations on October 24, 1962, and he facilitated negotiations between the parties from October 24 to November 7, 1962. France expressed support for the US on October 24, 1962, and Canada expressed support for the US on October 26, 1962. President Kennedy and Soviet Prime Minister Khrushchev agreed on October 28, 1962 that Soviet missiles would be removed from Cuba and that the US would not invade Cuba. President Goulart of Brazil offered to mediate negotiations on October 29, 1962, but the mediation offer was not accepted by the parties. UN Secretary-General U Thant proposed UN inspection of the missile bases in Cuba on October 30, 1962, but Cuba rejected the proposal on November 1, 1962. The Soviet Union withdrew the missiles from Cuba on November 7, 1962, and the US lifted the blockade of Cuba on November 20, 1962. Cuban military aircraft attacked the US fishing vessel *Ala* on February 21, 1963. The US coast guard seized four Cuban fishing vessels and 38 crewmen in US territorial waters on February 3, 1964, and Cuba referred the matter to the UN Security Council on February 4, 1964. Cuba reduced the water supply to the US military base at Guantanamo Bay beginning on February 6, 1964. On December 17, 1971, the US warned Cuba that it would take "all measures under international law" to protect commercial shipping in the Caribbean, following the seizure of two Panamanian-registered ships by Cuban gunboats on December 5-15, 1971. The US partially lifted economic sanctions against Cuba on August 21, 1975, allowing foreign subsidiaries of US companies to sell goods to Cuba. On August 31, 1979, the US announced that it had confirmed the presence of 2,000-3,000 Soviet combat troops in Cuba, as well as some 2,000 Soviet military advisors. *Non-Aligned Movement* (NAM) foreign ministers expressed support for Cuba's demand that the US return Guantanamo naval base on September 8, 1985.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the United States and Cuba begins with the Cuban revolution in 1959 and the rise to power of Fidel Castro. Issues of dispute between the two countries have varied from Cold War tensions involving Soviet support of Cuba and the the missile crisis in 1962 to incidents involving Cuban nationals as refugees to stopping the drug trade as the last mid indicates (MID3950 on 1/31/1990). Despite the wide range of conflicts within the rivalry, the central issue stems from the mutual hostility of each country's regime toward the other's. The United States has consistently had a policy of isolating Cuba from the international community with the desire to end the Castro regime. This policy has led to a lack of formal diplomatic relations for three decades along with an economic embargo of the country by the US. Because the Castro regime has been able to maintain power, the rivalry has continued between the countries regardless as to the administration in Washington, DC. Thus it seems that until the Castro regime ends, there will be no improvement of relations and no end to the rivalry.

Earlier disputes between the United States and Cuba did occur and involve US intervention in Cuban internal affairs. Given the fact that the US assisted Cuba in getting its independence from Spain in 1898, it seems that these earlier interventions are an effort to stabilize a very young government. These interventions even led to occupation in 1906. One could argue that the intervention policy of the US continues through to the present period even with the regime change by Castro in 1959, although it appears that the rivalry really is qualitatively different with Castro.

In 1898, due to a request from the planter class in Cuba, the US intervened in the Cuban-Spanish colonial conflict. US military occupation continued until Cuba achieved independent status in 1902. Prior to achieving independence, and as a condition of their independence, the US pressured Cuba into signing the Platt Amendment as an appendix to the Cuban constitution in 1901. The provision of the amendment allow for US intervention: for the preservation of Cuban independence and of a stable government capable of protecting life, liberty, and individual liberty; preventing Cuba from entering treaties with foreign countries without US approval; reinforced US authority to acquire land and maintain naval stations as a means of enforcing these previous provisions; reinforced the acts of the Military Government during occupation. Two additional provisions called for the Cuban government to continue with sanitary improvements and restricted Cuba's freedom to acquire debt.

During this period, the US and Cuba were heavily engaged economically. In 1903, a reciprocity treaty was enacted, giving Cuban growers preferential access to US markets as a means of stimulating the revival of sugar production. Cuban planters were heavily in debt from property damaged and crops lost during the previous rebellion. As a result, the door is opened for foreign (especially US) investment of capital in the Cuban domestic market. By 1906, an estimated 15% of all land in Cuba was US owned (72).

Although the two countries are engaged heavily economically and the US has considerable influence on the domestic and international affairs of Cuba, the two countries are not allies, nor is there any degree of coordinated activity on the military front. The relationship is characterized, in large part, by the Platt Amendment giving the US influence over domestic and foreign affairs and coercion, both overt and subversive.

On September 29, 1906 the United States officially takes control of the Cuban government due to the open rebellion that breaks out on August 16th. From September 1906 to January 1909, the United States occupies Cuba militarily and the United States appointed Charles Magoon as the military governor of the country. Magoon is tasked with putting down the insurrection and restoring order to the government and country of Cuba. 

In 1909, at the end of a three year US military occupation, the Liberal party assumed power of Cuba. The US, permitted by the Platt Amendment of 1901 to intervene in Cuban politics, had, prior to their 1906 military intervention, taken a conservative stance on interfering in Cuban domestic politics. However, as a means of preventing the need for future military intervention to protect US economic interests, the US vowed to use a more liberal interpretation of the Platt Amendment, expanding their influences to all levels of Cuban domestic politics. This came at a time when the newly empowered Liberal Party was interested in increasing their control over the Cuban state (Perez, 143). During the coming years, the US intervened in Cuban politics to `guarantee an open economy, reduce competition, and preserve a cheap and plentiful supply of labor in a peaceful, orderly, and prosperous environment' (Perez, 143). They used threats of military intervention to overthrow the political class as a means of pressuring the Cuban government to pass and enforce policy aimed at protecting foreign capital and interests. In terms of economics, the US was investing heavily in the Cuban economy. Because of extensive economic interests, the US exerted tremendous control over Cuban immigration policy (source of cheap labor), worked to depress wages and limit the influences of labor unions (Perez 153). However, and despite US efforts, organized labor did make inroads in gaining influence and members. Indeed, after 1910 strikes, boycotts, and labor stoppages were not uncommon. Given the extensive nature of US economic interests in Cuba, the actions of organized labor almost always had negative effects on US capitalists. US business interests put pressure on the US government to protect capital in Cuba; The US government, in turn, pressured the Cuban government to protect foreign capital. If the Cuban government was not able to maintain order, suppress the labor union activity, and protect foreign capital, the US threatened to intervene militarily. The biggest shift between the 1902-1906 period and 1909-1912 period is that the US's interference in Cuban political affairs becomes more overt. In addition, in the previous period the US was prepared, but reluctant to intervene militarily. In the subsequent period, the US uses overt threats of military intervention frequently for policy leverage. The first MID of RIV10002, MID1652, started on August 15, 1912 and ended on the same day. The second MID of RIV10002, MID1665, was a one day event on June 1, 1921. The third MID of RIV10002, MID1677, occurred from July 1993 to January 1934. No information could be found about the 1st and 2nd MIDs of RIV10002. Given the nature of MID1677 and the lack of information on the other two MIDs of RIV10002 this period was coded as a RIV10002-0.5. MID1677 is about the fact that in 1933, under pressure from domestic and international sources and with growing domestic unrest, the President of Cuba, Gerardo Machado, fled Cuba into exile. The US, led by US ambassador to Cuba Sumner Welles, helped install a provisional government led by Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. However, shortly thereafter students and non-commissioned military personnel, in what has been called `the Sergeants Revolt,' overthrew the provisional government and a new government, led by Ramon Grau San Martin, took power. The US, unhappy with this outcome, negotiated with the head of the Cuban military, General Fulgencio Batista, to have Grau step down. The US offered to reform the political and economic circumstances characterizing the US-Cuba relationship. Thus, in January 1934 Carlos Mendieta y Montefur was installed as the new President of Cuba; however, it is widely accepted that General Batista was the de facto leader of Cuba during this time. In return for the removal of Grau, the US abrogated the Platt Amendment and initiated a new trade agreement. 

The last MID of RIV10002, MID1677, ended in January 1934. In 1933, under pressure from domestic and international sources and with growing domestic unrest, the President of Cuba, Gerardo Machado, fled Cuba into exile. The US, led by US ambassador to Cuba Sumner Welles, helped install a provisional government led by Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. However, shortly thereafter students and non-commissioned military personnel, in what has been called `the Sergeants Revolt,' overthrew the provisional government and a new government, led by Ramon Grau San Martin, took power. The US, unhappy with this outcome, negotiated with the head of the Cuban military, General Fulgencio Batista, to have Grau step down. The US offered to reform the political and economic circumstances characterizing the US-Cuba relationship. Thus, in January 1934 Carlos Mendieta y Montefur was installed as the new President of Cuba; however, it is widely accepted that General Batista was the de facto leader of Cuba during this time. In return for the removal of Grau, the US abrogated the Platt Amendment and initiated a new trade agreement. Also, Cuba adopted a new constitution in 1940. The changes to the new constitution were aimed restricting the extent to which Cuba leaders were free to pander to US policy demands. Throughout the 1934-59 period, anti-US sentiment in Cuba is high, only falling briefly during World War II. Nationalist sentiment is also extremely prevalent during the time, with US interference in Cuban politics a constant rallying cry for Cuban opposition parties. After World War II, the US becomes particularly concerned about growing right wing radicalism in Cuba and the growing strength of the Cuban Communist Party. After a brief drop off in economic activity during the Great Depression, US-Cuba economic exchange is high during most of this period; especially after World War II. At the same time, US-Cuba officials frequently had disagreements regarding Cuban debt, trade taxes, unequal treatment of US and Cuban nationals, and the misuse of government funds. In the early 1950s, as a result of US policy of supporting opposition to communist movement in Latin America, began supplying military aid and advisors to Cuba. This continued until an arms embargo was placed on Cuba in 1958 in response to growing concerns regarding Batista's use of the Cuban military to put down domestic opposition. After this embargo, Batista's hold on power rapidly declined until he was forced to fee into exile. Castro's forces took control in January of 1959. The most significant difference between this period and the 1909-1912 period is that military intervention is effectively removed as an option of US foreign policy. US leaders are committed to maintaining political control over Cuban leaders and policy; however, military action is no longer a viable policy option.

Although the last dispute between the United States and Cuba took place in 1996, the fundamental tension between the two countries has yet to be resolved. In 2001, the United States reiterated that their fundamental goal for Cuba is a peaceful transition to a democratic form of government. Normalization of relations between the two countries-i.e. easing of trade and travel restrictions-is tied, according to the Bush Administration, to the liberalization of the Cuban economy and political system. The US announced in 2002 the Initiative for a New Cuba, calling for economic and political reforms in Cuba. The Cuban government has made no effort to enact these reforms. The first MID of RIV4, MID1742 started on January 14, 1959.

On December 17, 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro announced the beginning of a process of normalizing relations between Cuba and the United States. This has sparked a chain of events thereafter between Cuba and the United States such as lifting of some U.S. travel restrictions, fewer restrictions on remittances, U.S. banks' access to the Cuban financial system, and the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana and the Cuban embassy in Washington.
