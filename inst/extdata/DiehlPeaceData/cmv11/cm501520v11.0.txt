MID1426 

TERRMID: MID1426 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1426 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1426 Although the border was settled, Somalia had an active claim at the time to annex portions of Kenya inhabited by ethnic Somalis (per Huth and Allee 2002:390). The desire of Somalis to leave Kenya constitutes part of the defining feature of this MID, thereby making the territorial claim relevant here. 

TERRLINK: MID1426 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1426 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1426 Ethiopia and Somalia had an active territorial dispute at Ogaden (per Huth and Allee 2002), but this MID occurs in the Northern Frontier District, and there is no indication that the Ogaden dispute (outside this dyad) had any impact on the events of this MID.

TERRLINK: MID1378 1 -- third party link to territorial MID 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1378 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1378 Somalia also had an active territorial claim against Ethiopia for areas in which ethnic Somalis lived there (Huth and Allee 2002:385). The desire of Somalis to leave Ethiopia, as well as the Somali/Ethiopian response, constitute part of the defining events of this MID, thereby making the territorial claim relevant here. That claim lies outside the current dyad.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1378 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1378 from Gibler 2018, secessionist rebels who were ethnic Somalis wanted to secede and take pieces of Kenya and Ethiopia to join the state of Somalia. Kenya and Ethiopia formed a pact to combat the rebels, and each struggled to police the rebels in their territory. Somalia backed these rebels in their attacks against Kenya and Ethiopia, triggering this MID between Somalia and Kenya/Ethiopia. Coded civil war MID because this is connected to militarized rebel activity in Kenya, within this dyad. 

CIVWARLINK: MID1378 1 -- civil war link MID
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1378 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1378 coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebels in Ethiopia, outside this dyad, and Ethiopia's attempts to police those rebels within their borders.

Following the attack on a Kenyan border village by militiamen from Somalia, Kenya deployed an additional army unit to the border between the two countries. Additionally, Kenya again fortified its border with Somalia in March 2005 with additional armored vehicles and helicopters to prevent the spread of Somali tribal conflict into Kenya. First day of dispute was on 1/4/2005 and last day of dispute was on 3/17/2005.

Beginning in early November 2006, Kenya deployed additional troops and armored vehicles to the border it shares with the Gedo region of Somalia, most likely as a means of preventing a spillover of civil conflict raging in Somalia between the TNC, Ethiopian forces, and Somali rebels. First day of dispute was on 11/10/2006 and last day of dispute was on 11/10/2006.

NARRATIVE-CM:
On March 8, 1963, Britain announced that a disputed area would be given to Kenya upon its independence. On March 14, 1963, Somalia cut diplomatic relations with Britain because of its support of Kenya in the dispute over territory between the two countries. Britain called for a meeting between Somalia and Kenya in Rome on August 25-29, 1963 to prevent fighting between the two countries. Somalia attacked inside the Kenyan border 16 times in November and early December, 1963. Somalia claimed territory within Kenya following Kenya's independence on December 12, 1963. Kenya declared a state-of-emergency in the Northern Frontier District (NFD) on December 25, 1963, and closed the border with Somalia on December 29, 1963. A four member Ethiopian delegation met with the Kenyan government on December 28 following the passing of a mutual defense treaty one week earlier. Somalis (shiftas) attacked targets within Kenya beginning in January 1964. Kenya referred the matter to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Council of Ministers in February 1964. The OAU attempted to replace British forces along the border with an African peacekeeping force in February, 1964, and ordered a ceasefire. The OAU attempted to mediate negotiations between the parties in Khartoum, Sudan beginning on March 17, 1964. Kenyan and Somalian representatives agreed to a cessation of military hostilities mediated by the OAU on March 30, 1964. Kenyan forces killed 30 Somali raiders in April, 1964 near the northeast town of Wajis. Kenyan police also killed 15 of 160 Somalis who tried to ambush them the same month. Kenya and Somalia resumed military hostilities in 1965. President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania attempted to mediate a cessation of military hostilities in December 1965. The Kenyan government released a report on May 2, 1967 that stated that Somali troops were dependent upon Soviet arms supplies in their ongoing conflict. Kenyan officials began a tour of the Middle East to attempt to end arms supplies to Somalia from the United Arab Republic, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iran. Somalis clashed near Rhamu, Kenya on August 18, 1967, resulting in the deaths of 43 Somalis and three Kenyan soldiers. Prime Minister Mohammed Haji Ibrahim Egal of Somalia requested OAU mediation in September 1967. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, representing the OAU, mediated an agreement between Kenyan and Somalian representatives in Arusha, Tanzania on October 28, 1967, which provided for the normalization of relations and the establishment of a joint border commission. The final peace accord was signed on January 31, 1968. Some 2,000 Somalis, 600 Kenyan civilians, 33 Kenyan policemen, and 21 Kenya soldiers were killed during the conflict. Kenya and Somalia resumed diplomatic relations on February 1, 1968. Kenyan troops and Somali troops clashed near the border on June 27, 1977, resulting in the deaths of six Kenyan policemen and seven Somali soldiers. Kenya referred the matter to the OAU foreign ministers meeting on June 30, 1977. Kenyan Vice-President Daniel Arap Moi and Somali Vice-President Hussein Kulmia Afrah met on July 19, and the two countries pledged on July 20 to cooperate to keep peace along their border. Somalia claimed on September 26, 1977 that the United States offered to sell Somalia arms for their attack on Ethiopia in return for their dropping claims to Kenyan territory. On October 20, 1977, Kenya reported that Somalia still was claiming the disputed area on maps and sent a demand via the Egyptian government as intermediary for Somalia to renounce all such claims. King Khaled of Saudi Arabia facilitated negotiations between President Daniel Moi of Kenya and President Siad Barre of Somalia on September 9, 1979. Six Kenyans were killed during incidents in November 1980. Kenya and Somalia signed a border agreement on December 2, 1984. Somali soldiers crossed the border to Kenya in pursuit of several refugees on September 20, 1989. They killed four Kenyan policemen at the border telecommunications station in the process. Kenya threatened to retaliate.

Because this dispute did not fit within the scope of the basis for the rivalry between the two countries, it may be that the agreements of 1968 and 1984, along with the pledge to maintain peace in 1977 may be the most influential events in terminating the rivalry. Of the disputes pertaining to the disputed NFD, none have really occurred since 1984 however the problems between Kenya and Somalia have taken a different nature, especially after 1991. Specifically the border between the two countries was closed for long periods of time in order to stop the spillover of violence from Somalia to Kenya. Secondly, there have been no diplomatic relations between the two countries until 2003 and in 2006 the leader of Somali groups in southern Somalia has declared his group's desire to establish a greater Somalia which would incorporate territory disputed by Kenya and Somalia and currently owned by Kenya. Thus, the territorial dispute was not solved and even though it became latent, it reemerges in 2006. There are no significant signs to suggest that the rivalry ended, even though the lack of MIDs from 1989 to 2001 may make us believe so. The lack of a functional government in Somalia also makes it difficult to conclude any economic cooperation and security treaties with Kenya.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The majority of the disputes involved in the rivalry between Somalia and Kenya revolved around an area of land in Northern Kenya, the Northern Frontier District (NFD) that was given to Kenya by Britain as part of its independence on March 8, 1963. Somalia claimed that the area of land was rightfully theirs. As part of its policy to unify all Somalis that began in 1960, Somalia claimed that it was an issue of self-determination. The bloodiest fighting occurred over the next few years. Several cross-border incursions by Somalis resulted in casualties.

The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and other individual states made several attempts at mediations. Kenya and Somalia agreed to a ceasefire on March 30, 1964, ending MID1426, which included the fighting in this area since December 29, 1963. This was short-lived though, as Kenyan forces killed 30 Somali raiders less than a month later. There was another attempt by the two countries to have a ceasefire in 1965. This lasted until August 18, 1967 (MID1378), when another clash brought about 43 Somali and 3 Kenyan casualties. In October of 1967, relations were normalized through the Arusha Agreement again between the two countries. A peace accord was signed on February 1, 1968. 

There was another clash along the border on June 27, 1977 (MID3129). Six Kenyans and seven Somalis died. The two countries agreed on July 20 of that year to try to maintain peace along the border. On December 2, 1984, a formal border agreement was signed.

While there was another dispute between these two states on September 20, 1989 (MID3913), the nature of the dispute does not fit into the rivalry over the disputed NFD. Instead, this dispute occurred when Somali troops crossed the border in pursuit of refugees, and killed four Kenyan policemen in the process.

Deposed Somali President Siad Barre, on the run from rebels who toppled him arrived on January 29, 1991, by boat on the Kenyan island of Lamu, according to officials and residents of the island. Barre, whose one-man ruled lasted 21 years, was offered refuge by the Kenyan government after fleeing his capital Mogadishu by road. The ex-president arrived apparently from the coastal Somali town of Kismayu, 240 miles south of Mogadishu, residents contacted by phone from Nairobi said. Lamu, a medieval Arab trading port that is now a tropical holiday paradise, lies 290 miles east of Nairobi. A hotel owner on the island, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that some of Barre's entourage was in his hotel. ''They have security guards around their room. I do not even know their names,'' the hotel owner said. Barre's eventual destination is not known. Kenya made it clear Monday its offer of sanctuary was temporary. Nairobi's relations with Mogadishu were at best strained throughout Barre's rule. The ex-president, now in his 80s, progressively lost control of his capital to rebels of the United Somali Congress after they attacked it late in December. A brutal fight for the city forced thousands to flee, left thousands more dead and drove every Western aid agency and embassy out of the country. Since Saturday, the USC-in loose alliance with two other rebel groups, the Somali National Movement and the Somali Patriotic Movement-has been broadcasting calls for a return to normalcy, for exiles to return home and for a multi-party democracy to replace Barre's dictatorship. The rebels have said they plan to form an interim government before organizing multi-party elections.

On April 5, 1991, the government of Kenya has expressed concern over accusations leveled against Kenya by the new Somali regime. Reacting to remarks made by the new Prime Minister of Somalia, Umar Arteh Ghalib, in an interview he is reported to have given to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the government said the accusation lacked truth and validity. The new Somali Prime Minister is reported to have alleged that the government of Kenya was assisting those fighting the regime by supplying them with arms and ammunition. A statement from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, Wilson Ndolo Ayah, refuted these claims. Ayah said the government takes exception to the unwarranted attack, saying it was tantamount to interference with Kenya's sovereignty. The minister said Kenya had been approached by several NGOs, including (?arms) of the UN, for clearance to enable them to fly to Somalia with the aim of assessing what relief aid would be necessary for the people of Somalia in the light of the war there. He said these agencies had been allowed to airlift food and medicine from Kenya to parts of Somalia. But at no time had the government of Kenya sent food, medicine or any other supplies, including arms and ammunition. Ndolo Ayah said that the government of Kenya had not and would not authorize any organization of persons to send ammunition or arms to any group in Somalia for whatever purpose. Those Somalis who have been allowed to enter Kenya have done so under the auspices of the UNHCR. He said Kenya believes in the policy of good-neighborliness and non-interference and expected other countries to reciprocate.

Kenyan president Daniel Arap Moi reiterated on November 19, 1992, that his country will stick to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the Kenya broadcasting corporation reported. Moi made the reiteration at a meeting here with UN special envoy Ismat Kittani, in an apparent reaction to a reported US accusation that Kenya is backing some warring factions in Somalia. Moi said Kenya is keen on seeing the restoration of security and social order in Somalia but does not support any faction in the war-torn horn of Africa country. Moi told Kittani that Kenya values the sanctity of human life and despite its economic difficulties it has provided humanitarian aid to Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan. Kenya is hosting about 400,000 refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia and Sudan, out of whom some 330,000 are Somalis. Civil strife in those neighboring countries has affected the security of Kenya and put pressure on its economy, said the president. According to Moi, some Somalis who have fled to Kenya to seek refuge are criminals who rob and kill. The influx of refugees has forced Kenya to beef up security along the borders, Moi said asking donor countries and agencies to consider this difficult task and assist Kenya in the situation. at the meeting, Kittani said Somalia has no security, no police, no army and no social order, and that is the reason why the united nations deployed troops to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid. He thanked president Moi and the Kenya government for giving support to the UN in the difficult task of humanitarian work in Somalia.

Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on May 4, 1999, demanded that a U.N. agency send Somali refugees back home from Kenya, but the agency said it is still not safe for them to return to neighboring Somalia. Moi made the demand in Garissa where he spoke to residents in Kenya's Northeastern Province which borders Somalia. He said the same thing in the neighboring town of Wajir. Most of the Kenyan residents in the province are ethnic Somalis. The president said the refugees, who began streaming into Kenya in the early 1990s when Somalia succumbed to civil conflict and famine, had abused the country's hospitality by smuggling in firearms and sneaking out of their camps to commit crimes. Kenyan authorities have long insisted that weapons smuggled into the country from Somalia and neighboring war-torn southern Sudan have fueled the tremendous increase in armed robberies in recent years. There are 108,000 Somali refugees in Dadaab camp near Garissa, about 320 kilometers (220 miles) northeast of Nairobi, according to Millicent Mutuli, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Nairobi. Overall, Kenya is hosting 170,000 refugees from neighboring countries, down from a high of 423,000 in 1992. Mutuli at first said the UNHCR had no options as far as moving the Dadaab refugees. But after UNHCR officials met with government officials later Tuesday, she said the agency was going to look for possibilities for the refugees' voluntary return. ''We appreciate the government's concern for security in northeastern Kenya. We are going to be looking into ways of supporting the government's efforts in maintaining security and also look for possibilities for voluntary return for refugees to safe parts of Somalia,'' she said. Several dozen Somali refugee families have been camped out in front of the UNHCR offices in Nairobi for months. They were supposed to go to Dadaab when their camps on the Indian Ocean coast were closed, but they refused, saying Dadaab was too dangerous, and they want to live somewhere else in Kenya. Mutuli said most of the refugees in Dadaab are from the Bay and Bakool regions in south central Somalia where heavy clan-based fighting has been taking place between the Rahanwein Resistance Army and militiamen loyal to warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid.

On August 26, 1999, Kenya has banned with immediate effect all flights to and from Somalia on security grounds. The ban was announced by President Daniel arap Moi while addressing a political rally in Eastern Province. It comes after he had Sunday ordered the indefinite closure of the Kenya-Somalia border, due to security considerations. "There shall be no flights from Nairobi, Mombasa, Malindi or any other airport near the Somalia border with Kenya and no planes shall land in any of these airports from Somalia," Moi said. Planes carrying humanitarian and relief supplies to Somalia will have to seek government clearance.

Kenya has re-opened its border with Somalia, the president's office announced on April 12, 2000. It quoted President Daniel arap Moi as saying the move would allow customs officials to now operate at all border entry points to facilitate the continuation of legal business between the two neighbors. Moi ordered the closure of the border August, explaining that he had taken the move to prevent the illegal entry of aliens, contraband and illegal arms. He said then that the influx of arms and other contraband was detrimental to the security of the country, blaming the rising insecurity in northern Kenya and in most urban centres of the country on this influx. Moi also announced a total ban on all flights between Kenya and Somalia and ordered Kenyan security personnel to police the border between the two countries. He said the insecurity emanating from the warring factions in Somalia, which was spilling over into Kenya, was not conducive to the country's security and development agenda. Somalia has been without a central authority since the overthrow of the late President Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Since then, the country has remained ungovernable with various clan leaders controlling over different areas of the country, including the capital, Mogadishu, with one area breaking off calling itself Somaliland.

On November 21, 2000, Kenya has announced that it fully supports the recently inaugurated provisional government in Somalia, its eastern neighbor, saying the constitution of the authority was a welcome move. In an announcement that went short of formally recognizing the administration of Somalia President Abdikassim Hassan Salat, President Daniel arap Moi said Kenya had no objection in Somalia's quest to re-establish an Embassy in Nairobi. Kenya, Moi added, did not also object in Somalia joining international or regional organizations. Moi, who was conferring with the Somalia Prime Minister Ali Khalif Galaydh at his Harambee House office, was however, quick to add that peace and security in the country should be the commitment of all leaders. He advised Somalia to improve its national image by among other issues, establishing a conventional judicial system, adding that Kenya was ready to assist the country return to normalcy. Moi reiterated Kenya's adherence to the policy of good neighborliness, adding that he had in the past personally met several Somalia leaders representing different factions and interests to discuss the country's peace. Moi expressed the hope that in the foreseeable future, there would be greater understanding and harmony between East Africa and the horn of Africa for the attainment of greater economic gains. Premier Galaydh, who brought a special message from his President, appealed to Kenya to assist his country in the reconstruction of her dilapidated infrastructure. The new government in Somalia, he observed, appreciated Kenya's peace initiatives for Somalia and other troubled spots in the region. Kenya, he added, was committed to peace and security in the IGAD region, as her people realized that the two were a prerequisite for development. The Prime Minister also discounted fears that there was any kind of fundamentalism in the new government in Somalia and further extended an invitation to Moi to visit Somalia at an opportune time.

Kenya has agreed to support and re-open diplomatic ties with the new government in Mogadishu, the Somali Prime Minister, Ali Khalif Galaydh, said in Nairobi on November 21, 2000. Galaydh, who has been holding two days of talks with Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi and Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana, expressed satisfaction at the "supportive gesture" by the Kenyan government. He told a press conference that Kenya had played host to thousands of Somali refugees, who fled the war in their country over the past 10 years. The Prime Minister said he was in Nairobi to discuss with the Moi government, Somalia's desire to resume bilateral co-operation with Kenya, and to seek Nairobi's support. He confirmed that Kenya had agreed to the resumption of ties with the war-torn country. "Somalia wants to be back and take its rightful place. We want to be in IGAD (Inter Governmental Authority on Development), and Somalia wants to take its rightful place there too," he added. Galaydh confirmed that Somalia would take part in the forthcoming IGAD talks scheduled for Khartoum, Sudan. According to the prime minister, Somali President Abdulkassim Salat Hassan would like to participate in the IGAD talks in order to bolster its position in the region and to garner more support from neighbors. "Somalia needs the support of its neighbors in order for it to stand on its (feet) again," he said. "We need the diplomatic and political support because we are certain and determined that our government is going to work," he said, while appealing for international support and goodwill. Galaydh disclosed that during his stay in Nairobi, he also briefed his hosts on the security and political situation in Domslid. He expressed optimism that no force could destabilize the government, installed early this year in Mogadishu. Prime Minister Galaydh urged the opposition warlords, who still control pockets of the country, to end their hostilities and join forces with the new government. He said the government would remain tolerant and ready to accommodate all peace-loving Somalis. The opposing forces did not participate in the Atta Peace Conference in Djibouti, which brought about the new government. 

President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya on 28 July, 2001 declared a ban on cross-border trade between Kenya and Somalia. The decision had been made to curb the influx of arms into Kenya, said the paper. This is the second time in three years that Moi has imposed a ban on trade with Somalia. In August 1999, he also banned trade with Somalia, citing similar reasons. The ban was lifted six months later. The paper quoted Moi as saying Kenya would only deal with Somalia after a legitimate government had been installed in Mogadishu. The Kenyan MP for Fafi in northeastern Kenya, Elyas Barre Shill, said the move would not solve Kenya's security problem. He suggested that Moi should instead extend more support to the Transitional National Government (TNG) in Somalia, which would then deal with the arms problem from its side of the border, according to Monday's 'Daily Nation'. Meanwhile, the Kenyan assistant foreign minister, Mohamud Abdi Affey, told IRIN that the Kenyan government had recognised the TNG as Somalia's legitimate government, and that the president's statement had been "completely misinterpreted". Moi was actually referring to certain factions engaged in business activities between Kenya and Somalia who had "no interest in the establishment of a strong administration in Somalia", he said. Affey said the intention of the Kenyan government was "to exert pressure on these factions to rally behind the interim administration so that we can have a strong administration to deal with".

Kenya has appointed an ambassador to neighboring Somalia for the first time since 1990, when factional fighting sent the Horn of Africa nation spiraling into anarchy, the foreign ministry said on July 2, 2003, in a statement. Mohammed Affey will take up the post, but will coordinate affairs between the two countries from Nairobi due to continuing insecurity in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, the statement said. Kenya, like many other nations, closed its embassy in Mogadishu in 1990 as factional fighting erupted there. The fighting led to the overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 and the country plunged into anarchy and disintegrated into clan fiefdoms. Somalia's remaining relations were strained to the limit after the slaughter of UN peacekeepers in Mogadishu and the killing of 18 US Marines in 1993. But now, the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a grouping of seven eastern African states-Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and nominally Somalia-is currently mediating a peace settlement between warring sides with some progress already made since the talks started in Kenya on October 15. IGAD chief negotiator, Kenyan Bethwel Kiplagat, has pledged that a transitional government might be in place in Somalia by the end of the year.

Kenya's economic co-operation strategy with Somalia will revolve around the development of a vibrant livestock sector, revitalization of the Horn of African nation's aviation industry, and the clean-up of oil spills in the country's major Indian Ocean ports. In an exclusive interview in Nairobi on August 18, 2004, Kenyan Planning and National Development Minister Professor Anyang Nyongo told PANA that the government will protect its economic interests with the post-war Somalia. Those who are in a hurry to marginalize Kenya especially after the completion of the Somali peace process are in for a rude shock. We will not keep off especially when the new Somali state is being born," Nyongo said. "We have the technological capacity to help Somalia clean up its major ports. We could allow them to utilize our own engineers to unclog their ports affected by heavy oil spills but we are still waiting for the new government. We will definitely assist them once they ask for assistance," he said. The war-ravaged Somali is bracing for the return of peace and the installation of the new post-war government within the next two months. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), spear-heading mediation efforts among the warring factional leaders, is upbeat that the new Transitional Parliament would be inaugurated in Nairobi, as originally planned. Meanwhile, Nyongo hopes Somalia will join the 21-member state Common Market for Eastern and Central Africa (COMESA), the sub-regional East African Community (EAC), grouping Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania as a means of promoting regional trade. "We are looking forward to enhanced trade once peace returns to the country. We want Somalis to come to Mombasa-Kenya's coastal resort city-to shop for their essentials instead of flying to Dubai (the United Arab Emirates), this is the spirit of Pan Africanism," Nyongo reiterated. 

Kenya wants to enhance cross-border livestock trade with Somalia, a key economic mainstay for the Horn of Africa nation, promote fishing within the Indian Ocean and help promote new investments in Somalia once the country is back on the peace path, the minister said. He said key livestock markets exist in Europe and the Middle East but the two countries need to urgently address the threat of animal diseases. "It would be too difficult to convince the European Union (EU) that our livestock products are safe if any disease breaks in Somalia. We are intensifying inter-state livestock trade, which does not respect any borders but proper animal health care is crucial for this," the Kenyan minister said. He said Kenya will offer its Numerical Machining Complex, a state-owned enterprise which specializes in high technology engineering and foundry works to help in part of Somalia's reconstruction works. The Kenya Ports Authority, which serves about 11 countries in the east African region will also deploy its oil spills controlling machinery with the backing of Kenya's Pipeline Corporation (KPC) to clean up oil spills in Somali harbors, subject to the request of the yet to be installed Mogadishu government, Nyongo said. "Somalia's economy is closely intertwined with Kenya's. We have an important air-traffic flow between the two countries. Somalia's Diaspora also plays a substantially supportive role to Kenya's economy," he added. Kenya becomes the first country to candidly outline its economic strategy with Somalia, which has been without a government for the last 14 years since the collapse of General Mohamed Siad Barre's military rule. 

Somalia's transitional government and Kenya signed a framework agreement to work together on security and other issues on September 6, 2005, the first such agreement Somalia has signed with any country in 14 years. Somalia's transitional government has been eager to get international recognition since it left its temporary base in Kenya in June to try establish itself in the Horn of Africa country that has not had an effective government since 1991. In the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, Somali Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullahi Sheik Ishmail and Kenyan Foreign Affairs Chirau Ali Mwakwere signed the agreement that the two said provides only a basis for discussing how they will coordinate security along their long porous border. Ishmail said that the areas the two countries will work on are cross-border security, economic and financial cooperation, trade, education and health issues. Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said that other priorities for Somalia's collaboration with Kenya are helping Somali communities devastated by more than a decade of conflict and setting up local administrations throughout the country. There has been no effective central government in Somalia since clan-based warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Warlords then turned on each other, plunging the country of 7 million into chaos. The transitional government, formed after lengthy peace talks in Kenya last year, raised some hope, but its members quickly split over where the government should be based and whether it needs peacekeepers from neighboring countries to help establish order. Gedi played down those differences. "There are no split groups within the transitional federal government. The transitional federal institutions are one," he told journalists. "I recognize there are differences of opinion and this happens all over the world."

On August 20, 2006, the Kenyan government brushed aside accusations of Islamists in Somalia that Kenya joined the enemies opposing the success of the Union of Islamic Courts. Mohammed Abdi Afey, the Kenyan ambassador to Somalia, told Shabelle in an interview through the phone that his government never intended to cut its relationship with the Union of Islamic Courts. "Kenya is leading the rotating presidency of the Inter-Governmental authority on Development, IGAD, and conveys the result of every IGAD meeting to whom it may concern, and there is no any particular cruel intention that Kenya holds against Somalia, the Islamists in particular", said the Kenyan ambassador, adding that there was never unilateral decision from Kenya against any country within the regional organization. He said that sending African troops to Somalia was IGAD decision and Mosses Mwantagala, the assistant of Kenyan foreign minister, read the message as Kenya's Moi Kibaki was the president of IGAD. "Kenya is pleased to see that Mogadishu is secure and we have witnessed that when we were in Mogadishu. Kenya is always part of the solution, not of the problem", said Mr. Afey, adding that they briefed Kenyan senior authority after they went back to Kenya. The ambassador said that Kenya was the first country to send a minister to Somalia Mogadishu in particular. The news came after supreme leader of the Union of Islamic Courts, sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, called Kenya as an enemy of the Somali community. The previous week a delegation led by the Kenyan deputy foreign minister Mosses Mwantanga paid a visit to Somalia in an effort to convince the Union of Islamic Courts to go to the negotiating table in Khartoum Sudan. The Somali federal government and the Islamists are due to meet at end of this month.

Kenya has put its armed forces on high alert following the deterioration of security in neighboring Somalia it was learnt on September 30, 2006. They are maintaining a round-the-clock surveillance on the border, confirmed Foreign Affairs Assistant Minister Moses Wetang'ula. In addition the government has ordered the Navy, Kenya Ports Authority and the Marine Police to monitor all shipping in Kenya's territorial waters, said Mombasa DC [District Commissioner] Mohammed Maalim. Only ships authorized to ply within the country's current 200 nautical miles limit would be allowed in Kenya's territorial waters because of the current insecurity in Somalia, he added. Announcing the increase in security on the Kenya-Somalia border, Mr Wetang'ula could not however confirm reports attributed to Somalia's prime minister, Ali Mohammed Gedi, that both Kenya and Ethiopia were prepared to protect Baidoa-the fledging government's seat of power-from any possible attack by the Islamist group that is making rapid advances in the country. Mr Gedi's government controls only a small area around the town of Baidoa, while the Union of Islamic Courts has taken a large swathe of the land to the south. Earlier this month, the African Union agreed to a request by the transitional government to send in a regional peacekeeping force. Government spokesman Alfred Mutua commented that Kenya did not have a policy of invading other countries. But he added: "We are concerned about the flow of refugees from Somalia to Kenya which is an indication of the level of escalation in Somalia." Kenya was working with both sides to the Somalia conflict to find a solution to their problems but it was true that Kenya had been mandated by IGAD to support the Somali transitional government. 

The military will retaliate if anyone tries to "touch Kenya," the Kenyan defense chief warned on October 6, 2006 a day after Somalia's Islamic militiamen advanced to a border village and then withdrew. Minister of State for Defense Njenga Karume declined to name any group or person and said that Kenya, however, does not see any reason to deploy troops along its border with Somalia and for now has only increased police patrols. "The security of this country has been highly heightened. Anybody who might touch Kenya will face the full force of our military," Karume told journalists in the port city of Mombasa. Karume said that there are worrying trends in Somalia an indirect reference to that country's Islamists, who control the Somali capital and much of southern Somalia with piracy near Somali waters and an increasing flow of refugees from neighboring Somalia. It was a rare on-the-record comment by a Kenyan defense official on the situation in Somalia. In Geneva, the U.N. refugee agency said that the number of Somalis fleeing to Kenya has risen dramatically and could stretch the capacity of aid organizations to critical levels. In the past two days at least 2,000 Somali refugees have arrived through two border crossings, at Liboi and Amuma, bringing the total number who have fled to Kenya this year to more than 30,000, UNHCR said. Karume was speaking to journalists in the port city of Mombasa after receiving six patrol speed boats from the U.S. government. "The donation of boats is part of a much broader effort to help the government of Kenya protects its borders, especially due to the growing insecurity along its borders," Karume said. "This donation is particularly important in view of the deteriorating situation within Somalia, about which the Kenyan and U.S. government share similar concerns," U.S. Ambassador Michael Ranneberger said. Karume said that the situation in Somalia, if not checked, could damage Kenya's key foreign exchange earner, tourism, and its shipping sector. Somalia's militiamen traveled in 15 pickup trucks fitted with machine guns to Liboi village on the Somali side of the border, said truck driver Bashir Haji Ali, who saw them from the Kenyan side of the border. Abu Zeynab, a spokesman for the Islamic militia based in Somali seaport Kismayo, confirmed that the men went to Liboi midmorning before retreating to their base at Af Madow, about 140 kilometers (85 miles) east of the border. On Wednesday, Islamic militiamen advanced to within 20 kilometers (a dozen miles) of Baidoa, the only town controlled by the government, the closest the fighters have made it to the fragile administration's headquarters. Abdirahman Dinari, a spokesman for the Baidoa-based government, described the militia's advance as "a provocative action." Somalia has not had an effective national government since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohammed Siad Barre and then turned on one another, throwing the country into anarchy. A transitional government was formed in 2004 with U.N. help in hopes of restoring order after years of lawlessness. But it has struggled to assert authority, while the Islamic movement seized the capital, Mogadishu, in June and now controls much of the south. The Islamic group's strict and often severe interpretation of Islam raises memories of Afghanistan's Taliban, which was ousted by a U.S.-led campaign for harboring Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida fighters. The United States has accused Somalia's Islamic group of sheltering suspects in the 1998 al-Qaida bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden has said Somalia is a battleground in his war on the West. Associated Press writer Mohamed Olad Hassan in Baidoa, Somalia and Salad Duhul in Mogadishu, Somalia contributed to this report.

On November 19, 2006, the leader of the Islamic group that controls much of southern Somalia has revived the idea of a "Greater Somalia" that would incorporate regions of Kenya and Ethiopia a move that could further stoke tensions with the neighboring countries. Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, chairman of the Council of Islamic Courts, told that his group would work to unite ethnic Somali peoples, but he did not say how it proposed to achieve a "Greater Somalia." This is the first time that Aweys has spoken about expanding the influence of the Islamic courts outside Somalia since his group seized control of the capital, Mogadishu, in June and then consolidated its control over most of southern Somalia. "We will leave no stone unturned to integrate our Somali brothers in Kenya and Ethiopia and restore their freedom to live with their ancestors in Somalia," he said.

On November 28, 2006, Kenya started to feel how the crisis in Somalia was slowly and dangerously creeping into Kenya, this time over allegations that the country is hosting Ethiopian and American forces intent on attacking Somalia. This is a serious claim that has, rightly, been dismissed by the Government. Kenya's unease about the chaos enveloping Somalia can easily be discerned from the many peace initiatives that Nairobi has instituted in the last decade. And its goodwill towards Somalia can further be deduced from the thousands of refugees from Somalia that it has hosted for even a longer period.

Because this dispute did not fit within the scope of the basis for the rivalry between the two countries, it may be that the agreements of 1968 and 1984, along with the pledge to maintain peace in 1977 may be the most influential events in terminating the rivalry. Of the disputes pertaining to the disputed NFD, none have really occurred since 1984 however the problems between Kenya and Somalia have taken a different nature, especially after 1991. Specifically the border between the two countries was closed for long periods of time in order to stop the spillover of violence from Somalia to Kenya. Secondly, there have been no diplomatic relations between the two countries until 2003 and in 2006 the leader of Somali groups in southern Somalia has declared his group's desire to establish a greater Somalia which would incorporate territory disputed by Kenya and Somalia and currently owned by Kenya. Thus, the territorial dispute was not solved and even though it became latent, it reemerges in 2006. There are no significant signs to suggest that the rivalry ended, even though the lack of MIDs from 1989 to 2001 may make us believe so. The lack of a functional government in Somalia also makes it difficult to conclude any economic cooperation and security treaties with Kenya.
