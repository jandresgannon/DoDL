TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1265 from Gibler (2018), after WWI, several countries, including Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, pressed territorial claims against Hungary, recently broken away from Austria-Hungary. Here, Romania attacked Hungary to claim territory from Hungary, and France, as part of the Allies, alowed this to happen and facilitated the Hungarian surrender of territory to Romania. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute which France became involved in here.
