RIVNOTES: RIV1040 and RIV1041 seem to be related to the maritime boundaries between the Danish-held Greenland and the Norwegian-held Jan Mayen, even though I could not find specific information for this dates. This dispute was finally settled by the International Court of Justice in 1993. 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Denmark informed Norway of its intention to extend its "political and economic interests" to the entire island of Greenland on July 14, 1919, and requested formal recognition from Norway of Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland on January 18, 1921. Denmark announced its claim of sovereignty over southern Greenland on May 10, 1921, but Norway informed the Danish government that it could not recognize its claim since it would interfere with Norwegian fishing rights in the area. Danish and Norwegian representatives held negotiations concerning the dispute in Copenhagen and Kristiania beginning on September 25, 1923. Denmark and Norway signed an agreement on July 9, 1924, which provided for the protection of Norwegian fishing rights near southern Greenland. Norway claimed territory in eastern Greenland on June 28, 1931, but Denmark rejected the claim. Norway formally annexed eastern Greenland on July 10, 1931. The countries submitted the dispute to the *Permanent Court of International Justice* (PCIJ) on July 12, 1931. Norway annexed territory in southeast Greenland on July 12, 1932. The countries submitted the dispute to the PCIJ on July 18, 1932. The PCIJ decided the eastern Greenland dispute in favor of Denmark on April 5, 1933. The countries withdrew the southeast Greenland dispute from the PCIJ on April 18, 1933, and the PCIJ terminated its proceedings on the dispute on May 11, 1933.
