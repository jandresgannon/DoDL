NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Germany/Prussia and Saxony in the 19th century came about as a result of the Prussian attempt to defeat Austria and unite Germany under a single Prussian rule. Germany and Austria struck a military agreement in 1864 that allowed Prussia to attack and dominate Denmark. Prussia used the alliance with Austria to engage several small German states during the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864 (Clodfelter 1992). In February of 1864 Prussia attacked Hanover and Saxony (MID502), with the conflict ending in a compromise as Prussia was busy with Danish forces until the end of July. With the defeat of Denmark in 1964, Austria and Prussia received joint control over two provinces. This became a source of tension with Prussia demanding control over both provinces on one side and with the Hapsburg Empire backed by Bavaria, Saxony and Hanover on the other. Another small dispute regarding Prussian troop movement through Saxony occurred in November of 1964 (MID381). The two previous disputes were relatively low key and were only indicators of the conflict to come. In 1966 Prussia launched the Austro-Prussian war against the Hapsburg Empire and its supporters, including Saxony (Clodfelter 1992). Saxony contributed several hundred thousand troops and participated in two major battles on the side of Austria (MID261). With the defeat of Austria, the Prussian Empire under Otto von Bismark took control of Germany and annexed some of the smaller states such as Saxony into the German Federation (www.onwar.com 2003).
