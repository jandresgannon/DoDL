TERRMID-NOTES: MID1669 from Gibler 2018, the border between Italy-owned Somaliland and Ethiopia was undelimited, and attempts to resolve it were unsuccessful. In 1923, several minor border clashes occurred in the disputed area. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the disputed territory between Ethiopia and Italy.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID406 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, Italy and Ethiopia disputed territory, and in 1930, Italy built and manned border fortifications in the disputed area. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to disputed territory. However, GML recommend this case be dropped, since no protest came from Ethiopia; it is therefore coded uncertain.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Ethiopian troops defeated Italian troops in the Battle of Adowa. Ethiopia and Italy signed a peace treaty on October 26, 1896, which provided for Italian recognition of the independence of Ethiopia. The countries disputed the location of the border between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland. Ethiopia and Italy agreed on May 16, 1908 to establish a joint boundary commission to demarcate the border. *Ethiopia and Italy signed the *Treaty of Amity* on August 2, 1908. Ethiopia and Italy signed the *Treaty of Friendship, Conciliation, and Arbitration* in Addis Ababa on August 2, 1928. Ethiopian troops and Italian troops clashed in the Wal-Wal (Ualual) border region on December 5, 1934, resulting in the deaths of some 100 Ethiopians and 30 Italian native troops. Ethiopia referred the matter to the *League of Nations *(LON) Council on December 15, 1934. On January 3, 1935, Ethiopia informed the LON Council that Italy had mobilized troops in the border region. Italy sent reinforcements to East Africa beginning on February 23, 1935. Ethiopia proposed to resolve the dispute through arbitration on March 8, 1935, but Italy rejected the proposal on March 18, 1935. Ethiopia referred the matter to the LON Council on March 17, 1935. Ethiopia and Italy agreed on May 15-16, 1935 to submit the dispute to a five-member arbitration commission. The Ethiopia-Italy arbitration commission convened in Milan, Italy on June 6, 1935. Britain imposed military sanctions (arms embargo) against Ethiopia and Italy on July 25, 1935. The Ethiopia-Italy arbitration commission issued a report on September 3, 1935, which suggested that there was no evidence to suggest whether Ethiopia or Italy was responsible for the Wal-Wal clash. The LON Council established a five-member conciliation committee (Britain, France, Spain, Poland, and Turkey) on September 7, 1935. The LON conciliation committee presented proposals to the disputants on September 18, 1935, but Italy rejected the proposals on September 22, 1935. Ethiopia mobilized its military on September 28, 1935. Some 207,000 Italian troops invaded Ethiopia on October 3, 1935, and Italian troops occupied Adowa on October 6, 1935. The United States imposed military sanctions against Ethiopia and Italy on October 5, 1935. The LON Assembly established the Coordination Committee (Sanctions Conference) headed by Augusto de Vasconcellos of Portugal to coordinate measures taken against Italy by member-states. The LON Coordination Committee approved the imposition of economic sanctions (trade embargo) against Italy on October 11-19, 1935. Britain and France began mediation efforts on October 29, 1935. Italian troops occupied Gorahai and Makalle on November 7-8, 1935. The LON Assembly imposed economic sanctions (trade embargo) and military sanctions (arms embargo) against Italy beginning on November 18, 1935. Britain and France submitted a peace proposal to Ethiopia and Italy on December 11-12, 1935, but Italy rejected the proposal on December 18, 1935. Italian troops occupied Gondar on April 1, 1936, and Ethiopia again appealed to the LON Council for assistance on April 1, 1936. The LON Council appealed to Italy to end military hostilities against Ethiopia on April 20, 1936, but Italy rejected the appeal. Italian troops captured Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, on May 5, 1936. Italy formally annexed Ethiopia on May 9, 1936, and Marshal Badoglio was appointed governor-general of Ethiopia on May 10, 1936. Some 4,350 Italians and 275,000 Ethiopians were killed during the conflict. The US lifted military sanctions against Ethiopia and Italy on June 20, 1936. The LON Council lifted the economic and military sanctions against Italy on July 15, 1936. Germany recognized Italy's annexation of Ethiopia on October 24, 1936. Austria and Hungary recognized Italy's annexation of Ethiopia on November 12, 1936. Italy withdrew from the LON on December 11, 1937. British troops commanded by Lt. General William Platt attacked Italian troops in Eritrea on January 19, 1941. British and Ethiopian troops captured Addis Ababa on April 5, 1941. Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia on May 5, 1941, and the country was liberated on May 10, 1941.

I could not find any record of MID1669 in 1923, although it was in August of 1923 that Ethiopia was admitted as a member of the League of Nations. There was a substantial debate within Europe as to whether or not to allow this because of Ethiopia's continued use of slaves. There may have been some Italian opposition to Ethiopia's recognition. Ras Tafari visited Italy in 1924, and by accounts had a positive interaction with Benito Mussolini. In 1925, Italians took control of a line of strategic water holes. By 1926, Italian patrols of these areas elicited Ethiopian protest. Ethiopia and Italy signed the *Treaty of Friendship, Conciliation, and Arbitration* in Addis Ababa on August 2, 1928. 

In the late 1920s, Italians in Eritrea convinced Ras Gugsa Wole to rebel against the Tafari regime in Ethiopia. This effort ended on March 31, 1930 when Gugsa was killed on the battlefield. This is MID406. MID407 is designated to occur during the month of September 1931. This is during the 2 1/2 month period in which Haile Sellassie was consolidating his power, culminating in the opening of parliament on November 3, 1931. There is little record however, of any direct disputes between Italy and Ethiopia during this month. Mussolini really began laying the groundwork for taking Ethiopia in 1932, building roads within Ethiopian territory and setting up the infrastructure for a campaign.

Ethiopian troops and Italian troops clashed in the Wal-Wal (Ualual) border region on December 5, 1934, resulting in the deaths of some 100 Ethiopians and 30 Italian native troops. Ethiopia referred the matter to the *League of Nations *(LON) Council on December 15, 1934. On January 3, 1935, Ethiopia informed the LON Council that Italy had mobilized troops in the border region.

Ethiopia mobilized its military on September 28, 1935. Some 207,000 Italian troops invaded Ethiopia on October 3, 1935, and Italian troops occupied Adowa on October 6, 1935.

The LON Council appealed to Italy to end military hostilities against Ethiopia on April 20, 1936, but Italy rejected the appeal. Italian troops captured Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, on May 5, 1936. Italy formally annexed Ethiopia on May 9, 1936, and Marshal Badoglio was appointed governor-general of Ethiopia on May 10, 1936. Some 4,350 Italians and 275,000 Ethiopians were killed during the conflict, designated as MID111. 

British troops commanded by Lt. General William Platt attacked Italian troops in Eritrea on January 19, 1941. British and Ethiopian troops captured Addis Ababa on April 5, 1941. Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia on May 5, 1941, and the country was liberated on May 10, 1941. Some 4,000 Italian soldiers and 1,100 British soldiers were killed during the Allied reconquest of Ethiopia. This conflict is designated MID258.

On May 5, 1943, Mussolini proclaimed that Italy would return to Africa and take Ethiopia back. On June 2 of that year, the Ethiopian Prime Minister requested that Ethiopian troops be allowed to spearhead an invasion of Italy in order to get revenge for Italy's occupation of Ethiopia. Aside from the ongoing African campaign, these are the two main comments that were reported as directed between the two countries during the period, designated MID3527. It seems that the main conflict that made up the rivalry (Italy's claim over Ethiopia) ended in May of 1941, thus ending the basis for the rivalry itself.
