RIVNOTES: 
RIV5.10: 
RIV11348 was originally coded as two separate rivalries (RIV1347 and RIV1348). Yet these were combined because there was only a16 year gap between the rivalries and most of the disputes in both rivalries involved cross-border insurgency.

PS: 19480104-19531015 0.5 19531016-20209999 0.00

PS-UPDATE2020: remains a severe rivalry in the absence of resolution of a border disputes, refugees across borders, and controversies over internal turmoil in Myanmar. Some evidence of recent friendlier relations between miitaries of the two sides.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3574 coded somewhat territorial MID because this was partially connected to disputed territory. The claim to Hill 491 is not an official territorial claim in Huth and Allee 2002. Rather, it seems that Burmese troops came across a hill that was strategically valuable and claimed it. The claim, however, did not last, and the unnamed hill does not appear in other MID narratives.

The underlying issue of this MID stemmed from hostile actions taken by Myanmar against SSA and KNU rebels, resulting in spillover effects and increased tensions across the Myanmar-Thailand border. Thailand deployed additional troops to the shared border several times to prevent such spillover effects and incurions into Thai territory by rebels. On some instances, Myanmar and Thai troops clashed directly when Myanmar's internal conflict spread over the border. First day of dispute was on 2/8/2002 and last day of dispute was on 10/27/2002.

This dispute involves a basic conflict between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand over the use of Burmese/Thai border territory by Karen rebel forces operating against the Burmese government. In border fights with the Karen, Burmese government shelling often spills over into Thailand, and Burmese forces pursue Karen guerillas into Thai territory prompting a Thai military response. The issue of which side initiated the incidents is ambiguous in many of these cases. The areas of operation include the Karen base of Kawmoora in Burma, opposite the Thai village of Mae Sot, 240 miles north of Bangkok, and the Tak province, the Song Yang district of Thailand. First day of dispute was on 2/8/1995 and last day of dispute was on 3/1/1995.

A peace agreement between the Shan warlord Khun Sa and the Burmese government results in Burmese troops occupying territory also claimed by Thailand. The warlord Khun Sa and his army provided a buffer between Thailand and Burma by holding the contested border territory. Subsequent to the peace agreement, Burmese troops move in the area and remain. The dispute takes place in Doi Lang, 672 km north of Bangkok. First day of dispute was on 1/3/1996 and last day of dispute was on 1/8/1996.

This dispute involves demarcation of territorial waters between Myanmar and Thailand. In this instance, a Thai fishing trawler in the disputed territorial waters is attacked by an armed Burmese fishing boat. A Thai naval vessel responds to the distress call and is fired upon by the Burmese fishing boat. The Thai patrol boat returns fire and is subsequently attacked by two Burmese frigates. The Thai vessel returns fire against the Burmese frigates. Burma's claim to the waters is based on old British charts, while Thailand's claim rests on charts drafted by France. The exchange of gunfire occurs off the west coast of Thailand, near the city of Ranong. First and last day of dispute was on 1/12/1999.

This dispute involves a chronic problem in Thai/Burmese relations; specifically, anti-government rebel forces seeking to topple the Burmese government operate along the Thai/Burmese border leading to violent engagements that spill over into Thailand. In one incident in this MID, Burmese troops move into Thai territory in an attempt to encircle rebel forces and end up in a gunfight with Thai military forces. Frequently, Thai military forces fire live or smoke shells into Burma in an effort to keep the fighting within Burmese territory. First day of dispute was on 2/10/2001 and last day of dispute was on 4/29/2001.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Burma and Thailand has had a number of origins and issues. The Thai and Burmese have an historically conflict prone relationship. The two share a 1,100-mile border in addition to a common religion and similar culture. They have engaged in a number of wars over the centuries. The rivalry between them that is composed of mids begins in the 1950s. Here, the problem of Chinese Irregular Forces in Burma caused tension. After Mao gained control of China, Nationalist Chinese forces fled to Burma and conducted operations in northern Burma. Burmese forces occasionally pursued them. The Chinese would then flee to Thailand for refuge. The Burmese would then pursue the Chinese into Thailand frequently engaging in conflict with Thai forces. Second, continuing insurgent activity in the common border area has caused recurrent fighting. Much of the fighting that has taken place between the Burmese and the Thai has concerned internal fighting between various insurgent groups such as the Shan and the Karen ethnic groups. This internal fighting has frequently spilled over into Thailand. There is also the issue of opium production and smuggling. Many insurgent groups use the illegal production and trafficking of opium as a source of revenue to finance their military operations. Thus, much of the opium issue is tied up or subsumed within the insurgent issue. Many opium refineries were located in Burma, just a few hundred yards from the Thai border. Thus, when Burmese officials raided the opium facilities those involved could easily move across to the Thai side of the border. Most heroin that reached world markets is produced in the region called the golden triangle in the frontier region of Burma, Laos, and Thailand. And the majority is then trafficked through Thailand. There have also been some disputes with respect to fishing waters. Thai fishermen have poached in Burmese waters frequently in the 1960s and 1970s. They considered the Burmese waters to be more plentiful than the Thai waters that have been exploited for their resources.

The first MIDs to occur involved the pursuit of Chinese nationalist troops in northern Burma. The Chinese took refuge in Burma after the 1949 victory of Mao's communist forces in the Chinese civil war. The Burmese sought to drive the Chinese nationalist forces out and would frequently chase these groups across the Thai border that frequently triggered conflict with the Thai. Later in the rivalry similar conflict occurred involving the Shan and Karen states (both of which have militarized rebel/insurgent/secessionist movements). In these conflicts the source of the conflict was similar to those involving the Chinese nationalist forces. The Burmese Army would pursue the rebels into Thai territory resulting in Thai retaliation and engagement by both sides in relatively short skirmishes in which a few to a dozen lose their life.

Chinese Nationalist Forces operating in Burma. MID2018 occurred in October of 1953. Chinese nationalist forces sought refuge in Northern Burma and Thailand. Burma sought to force them to evacuate Burma and bombed the nationalist Chinese camps. It also bombed camps in Northern Thailand killing Thai armed forces in the process.

MID2023 occurred in late March early April of 1954. Karen rebels in Burma declared intent to establish an independent state within Burma. Fighting broke out between the government forces of Burma and the Karen insurgents aligned with the Chinese nationalist forces. Thailand fortified its border to prevent the spread of the fighting to Thailand.

MID2024 took place in March of 1955. Here the Burmese Army pursued Chinese Nationalist forces in Northern Burma and in Thailand. The Thai fortified their border in response.

MID2841 occurred in June of 1959. The Thai government charged that a Burmese plane bombed and strafed a frontier Thai village killing one person. The Burmese claimed they were in pursuit of rebels in the incident.

This marks the end of this stage in the rivalry between Burma and Thailand. There is a sixteen-year lull in the militarized aspect of the rivalry between the two countries but the issues that motivate the rivalry are similar in both periods and that these two rivalries should be combined. The issues on both sides of the lull involve the activity of separatist movements using Burmese territory and then fleeing to Thai territory when pursued by Burmese forces.

There are also a number of militarized issues occurring in the interim period not coded in the MID dataset. In November of 1969, former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu went to Bangkok and was granted political asylum. He then set up a rebel organization to overthrow the Ne Win regime in Rangoon. This caused a military alert response in Burma. Also in 1969, a Thai fisherman was shot in Burmese waters. Thailand reacted angrily and announced a naval exercise in the Indian Ocean to protect Thai fishermen. Moreover from 1965 until 1976 nearly 300 Thai fishing vessels were captured by Burmese naval vessels. Thus, the rivalry does not end in this period.

MID3130 occurred in June of 1977. Thai forces provided Karen rebels sanctuary in Bangkok and given special detainee status because of their anti-communist position.

MID3074 occurred in December and January of 1983. Here the Burmese navy was involved in the detention of a number of Thai fishermen for poaching Burmese fishing waters. Over 400 were arrested and eventually returned in 1985.

Burmese troops and Thai policemen clashed near the border on March 12, 1984, resulting in the deaths of two Thai policemen and 15 Burmese soldiers(MID3027). The Burmese cross into Thai territory in pursuit of Karen separatists.

MID3618 occurred from May until November. Burmese forces initiated a renewed effort to fight Karen insurgents along the Thai border. Here as in past, Burmese troops pursue insurgents across the Thai border and engage in hostilities with Thai forces.

MID2777 occurred in April and May of 1987. Thai military forces seized control of approximately 30 strategic hilltop positions held by Shan Rebels. The Thais were making an effort to show Rangoon its new policy of fighting against Burmese insurgents in the common border area. The Thais however, did not coordinate these activities with the Burmese. The Burmese reacted militarily to the Thai movements.

MID2747 occurred from August through October of 1988. All cities, towns and major villages in Burma are shaken by daily mass demonstrations for democracy. A general strike cripples the country. Karen insurgents initiate offensives during this period to recapture lost territory. The Burmese pursue insurgents in fighting across the Thai border engaging with Thai forces.

400 Burmese troops crossed into Thai territory to attack the Karen rebel base at Wangkha. In the operation the Burmese attacked a border village in Thailand on May 21, 1989, and Thailand demanded compensation from Burma in June 1989 (MID3919).

MID3960 occurred in February of 1990. The Karen separatists had an encampment in Thailand along the Burmese border near the Three Pagodas Pass. Burmese Army soldiers attacked the Karen insurgents in Thailand. Thai security forces then fired on the Burmese forces killing nine or ten.

MID3574 occurred in 1992. Here the Burmese and the Thais disputed a hill named hill 491 (the hill is 491 meters tall). The Burmese captured the hill from Thai control when pursuing Karen insurgents. The Burmese wanted to retain control of the hill due to the strategic advantage it gave the army in pursuit of the Karens.

MID4002 occurred in February of 1995. Here, as in the previous MIDs, Burmese pursuit of Karen insurgents into Thailand resulted in Thai security forces firing on Burmese troops.

MID4003 occurred in January of 1996. For decades, the Shan state (a Burmese region that borders Thailand) has served as a buffer between Thailand and Burma. Thailand and Burma are historic enemies with frequent conflict in the past. A rebel movement in the Shan state has directed the conflict in the region internally between the Shan and Burmese Army in Rangoon. During this MID the Burmese Army fight a battle with Khun Sa, the leader of this rebel group and announce the signing of a ceasefire with the leader. They have been at war for decades. This deal causes tension in Bangkok as the Thai feel a threat in the loss of their buffer. The Thai military is put on alert.

On January 12, 1999 MID4138 occurred. Here the Burmese and the Thai clash over three small islands of the Thai west coast city of Ranong. The source of the clash is competing claims to the islands and the fishing waters associated with them. The Burmese use British charting and claims of the area while the Thai use differing French charting and claims. The Thai and Burmese navy came to the aid of fishing vessels of both countries that were embroiled in an armed clash. The respective navies exchanged fire resulting in the deaths of three Burmese sailors and two Thai sailors.

MID4314 occurred from February through April of 2001. Burmese troops pursued soldiers from the rebel Shan State Army and wanted Bang Pang Noon hill to set up their artillery but Thai Rangers refused them access. The following morning Thai troops began to shell the base. Both sides exchanged gunfire and mortar shells in Mae Sai district, as well as in other areas. The clashes between Thai and Burmese troops broke out the next morning when about 500 Burmese troops seized the hill, taking 19 Thai rangers hostage at the base camp there.

Burmese-Thai relations have been tainted by a long history of protracted border conflicts, sporadic hostilities over narcotics trafficking, Burmese insurgents operating along the Burmese-Thai border, and the large number of Burmese who cross the border to work illegally or claim refugee status. In fact, the Burmese Government closed the Burma-Thai border for several months during the summer of 2002.

Thailand expressed "grave concern" on July 13, 2006, over Myanmar's shooting of a Thai helicopter near the two countries' border earlier in the week. The helicopter was delivering food Sunday to army rangers in Thailand's northern Mae Hong Son province near a military base in Myanmar when it was shot at three to five times, Thailand's foreign ministry said in a statement. The statement said "Myanmar" fired the shots, but did not say specifically who might have done it or why. The rounds pierced the aircraft's underbelly and left several holes in it, the ministry said. No one was injured, and the engine was not damaged. Anuson Chinawanno, director of the East Asia division at the Foreign Ministry, sent a letter to Myanmar's ambassador in Bangkok expressing Thailand's "grave concern," and urging closer cooperation along the border "to prevent misunderstandings and such incidents from happening in the future." Myanmar officials did not immediately respond to the statement. Thailand and Myanmar have a history of tensions, many of them focusing on Myanmar ethnic rebel groups who operate along the border.

However, official and unofficial economic ties between the two nations are significant, and the current Thai and Burmese Governments seem eager to reach a new, more cooperative, level in their bilateral relations. Moreover, efforts at improving ties have taken place intermittently since the beginning of the rivalry.

On August 1, 1950, Thailand closed its border with Burma in order to avoid a spill-over into its territory of the Burmese-Nationalist Chinese troops in Burma. There were no problems between Thailand and Burma at the time, and actually Thailand's closure of the border most likely helped the Burmese military. I could not locate any other information about the Thai-Burmese relations during this time period.
