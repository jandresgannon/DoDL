CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3127 from Gibler 2018, the Zambian president expressed public support for militarized rebel action in South Africa to oppose the regime there, and threatened to attack South Africa if they experienced an invasion from South African troops. Later, Zambians were killed in clashes with South African troops in South Africa-controlled Namibia. Tanzania is also pulled into this MID against South Africa by threatening to assist Zambia if South Africa invaded. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in South Africa.
