NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Chile and Spain developed out of continuous Spanish intervention in the region during the 19th century. Conflict between the two states began with Chilean opposition to the Spanish supported Flores expedition to establish a monarchy in Ecuador in 1846 (MID1498 on 12/7/1846), along with Chilean support of Peru during its conflict with Spain. The last three mids (MID1595 on 8/10/1862, MID1563 on 4/14/1864 and MID1482 on 2/1/1865) bring the issue of intervention directly to Chilean interests. As early as 1862, the Spanish navy arrived in Chilean waters as a show of force to the Latin American republics that Spain was determined to protect its nationals and economic interests in the region. In April 1864, Spain began harrassing Chile and initiated belligerent actions toward the country after it began to conclude its dispute with Peru over the Chincha islands in late 1864. The Spanish claimed that the belligerent actions were in response to Chile's instigation of Peruvian hostility to Spain. For this active participation by Chile, Spain demanded reparations. Instead of honoring these demands, Chile declared war on Spain in May,1865. 

Chile was joined by Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador in 1866, forming the Quadruple Alliance. The war ended in May, 1866 after the Spanish navy suffered damages by Peru during the bombardment of Callao. The naval ships returned back to Spain, concluding the militarized part of the dispute. On October 6, 1866 US Secretary of State Seward offered to mediate the dispute. All disputants except Peru agreed to the mediation. Due to strong domestic support of the war, Peru refused the offer in March 1867. On March 27, 1868 the US offered to mediate again. Peru accepted the offer. In 1869, Chile consented to mediation by the US involving all the disputants. On April 11, 1871 Chile and Spain agreed to an armistice. This armistice concluded the dispute between the two countries. 

While Chile soon found itself embroiled in other conflicts, namely the War of the Pacific in 1879, making continuation of the rivalry with Spain unlikely, the most important aspect of the ensuing peace between Spain and Chile was the gradual departure of the Spanish empire from Latin America. In 1868, Spain suffered a liberal revolution after suffering severe economic depression due to falling exports and a shrinking railroad industry. The depression was also deepened by the war with Peru and Chile in 1866 due to the fact that Spain alienated creditors in London and Paris who maintained economic interests in both countries. The Spanish economy at this point was rather strongly connected to both British and French capital markets. The revolution internally divided the Spanish government, from 1868 - 1874. Additionally in 1868, Cuba began its war of independence from Spain that lasted until 1878, further distacting Spanish interests from territory it had already lost to independence movements. By 1870, for example, Spain had sent over 100,000 troops to Cuba, to try and end the war. In 1874, Spain resumed its monarchy after the liberal revolution failed. The monarchy was able to end the war in Cuba with the peace of Zanjon in February 1878. Additionally during this period, it officially ended war with Peru with a treaty of peace and friendship on April 14, 1879. Peace and stability for Spain and its influence in Latin America, however, proved temporary as Cuban revolts for independence began again in 1895, leading to war with Cuba and the United States in 1898. With Spain's defeat, the Spanish empire in Latin America was terminated, thus ending the possibility of continued rivalries with any of its former colonies.
