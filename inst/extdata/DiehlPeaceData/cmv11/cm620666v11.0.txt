CIVWARMID: MID2591 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID2591 2 -- somewhat certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2591 from Gibler 2018, in 1986 Israel forced down a Libyan plane in Israel that was suspected of carrying a wanted terrorist, but found he was not aboard and released the plane. Coded civil war MID because from NYT 1986, Israel suspected that a Palestinian terrorist leader was on the plane and that the leader was returning from a conference of radical Arab and Palestinian organizations in Libya. The specific organization the leader belongs to is unclear, which explains why we code it somewhat uncertain. The claim that the wanted terrorist was a leader who was traveling internationally to attend a conference of radical organizations, however, suggests that the group is an organized, militarized rebel group.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Israeli military aircraft fired on a Libyan airliner over the Sinai Peninsula on February 21, 1973, resulting in the deaths of 93 individuals. Tunisia condemned Israel on February 21, 1973, and Tanzania condemned Israel on February 22, 1973. The *International Civil Aviation Organization *(ICAO) condemned Israel on March 1, 1973. Israeli military aircraft intercepted a Libyan civilian plane near Cyprus on February 4, 1986, and forced the Libyan plane to land in northern Israel.
