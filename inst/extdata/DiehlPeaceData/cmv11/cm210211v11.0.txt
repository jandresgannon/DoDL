PSNOTES: Riv5.20 dataset has the end date of RIV489 as 18330521. I modified it to 18390419 as that is the date on which the Treaty of London that acknowledged Belgium's independence was signed. On that date Netherlands accepted the loss of Belgium. Until then Belgium was a break-away/secessionist kingdom from the Netherlands, which did not acknowledge Belgium's independence. Netherlands-Belgium-Luxembourg Customs Convention signed in 1944 and Benelux Union in 1958.

Riv5.20 dataset has the end date of RIV489 as 18330521. I modified it to 18390419 as that is the date on which the Treaty of London that acknowledged Belgium's independence was signed.

From 1839 to 1944 there have been a number of disputes between Belgium and Netherlands, especially in the aftermath of World War I when Belgium wanted to annex the Dutch provinces of Limburg, all Dutch territory east of Meuse River and south of Scheldt River (the Wielingen Treaty, accepted by Belgium, rejected by the Netherlands). The negotiations over these issues broke up several times and in 1937 the two countries agreed to bring this issue to the attention of the Permanent Court of Justice. On September 9, 1944, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the Benelux Customs Union and this signaled the start of the Belgium-Dutch alliance. On January 1, 1948, the Benelux Treaty entered into force. On April 4, 1949, both Belgium and the Netherlands became original members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 1957 the Treaty of Rome, providing for even more integration of the European Communities was signed with Belgium and the Netherlands as original members. On November 1, 1960, the Benelux Economic Union entered into force, allowing for the free movement of workers, capital, services, and goods between the three countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg). On February 7, 1992, the Maastricht Treaty was signed and with it the creation of the European Union was accomplished. The Maastricht Treaty basically extended the free movement of workers, capital, services, and goods between all members of the European Union, and copied the Benelux institutional system to the EU level. 

Belgium and the Netherlands took each other to the international courts to solve several pending issues: the frontier at the enclave of Baarle-Hertog (1959)-at the International Court of Justice, and the revitalisation of the so-called Iron Rhine railroad (2005)-at the Permanent Court of Arbitration. These cases, even though they went to the international courts of justice represent insignificant, small disputes between the two countries.
