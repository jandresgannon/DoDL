TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Serbia was not claiming the Yugoslavian states' territory as under its own sovereignty, but did dispute their international boundaries in the sense that Serbia thought the Yugoslavian states should not have their own boundaries independent of a Yugoslavian state. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the US became involved in this MID, which is territorial, civil war, and civil war link. See CIVWARMID and CIVWARLINK.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/indepence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia, armed the villagers, and the newly armed villagers violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. The US was pulled into this MID when they reversed their policy of supporting a united Yugoslavia and denounced Serbia as the aggressors and imposed economic sanctions. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced the US and other NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Netherlands, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, this civil war MID appears in many dyads, as it is a multilateral MID involving Yugoslavia vs. all the UN/NATO countries who imposed sanctions, a blockade, a no fly zone, or shows of force against Yugoslavia in order to stop the ethnic cleansing, international war, and civil war incitement by Serbia. Denmark's involvement in NATO pulls them into this MID.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of "protecting" the ethnic Serbs there.

In response to Yugoslav involvement in Bosnian civil war, Western countries first showed force and then began a blockade against Yugoslavia. On 7/16/1992 there was a show of force by USA, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Italy. The blockaded against Yugoslavia commences on 11/22/1992 with Belgium joining the states mentioned above. Netherlands joins the MIDdue to its assistance to the US and France by enforcing a No-Fly zone over Yugoslavia on 4/12/1339. End date is the end date of the Blockade.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 6/11/1998 and last day of dispute was on 6/10/1999.

NARRATIVE-CM:
MID4137 In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99.

MID4186 This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. 

MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000. MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

PS-NARRATIVE:

On January 31st, 1946, the new constitution of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was adopted, modeling the Soviet Union's. Yugoslavia was officially a Communist country. 

On October 28, 1965, Yugoslavia tried to reach out to the EFTA countries outside of the Common Market, in an attempt to create a better trade agreement with them. Denmark, the leader of EFTA during this year agreed to analyze Yugoslavia's proposal. 

Josip Vrhovec and his delegation left Copenhagen on 2nd February, 1980. During his visit the Yugoslav Foreign Secretary was received by Queen Margaret II and Premier Anker Joergensen. He had talks with Kjeld Olesen, Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs. The two Ministers discussed bilateral and international relations. They expressed concern over the increasing use of pressure in international relations, the violation of the sovereignty of small countries and the intensified rivalry by the big powers. The normalization of international relations demanded above all that foreign intervention was stopped and that the sovereignty of all peoples and countries was strictly respected. The talks were cordial and friendly and held in an atmosphere of full mutual respect. It was noted that the attitudes of the two countries were close or identical. The two Ministers also discussed relations between Yugoslavia and the EEC and emphasized that the earliest possible regulations of outstanding problems would have a very positive effect on economic co-operation. On the subject of Europe, they agreed about the significance of the Madrid review meeting and stressed that everything possible should be done for the meeting to proceed under the most favourable conditions. The Ministers also pointed out the need for stricter respect for and implementation of the London agreement on Zimbabwe, Josip Vrhovec invited Kjeld Olesen to visit Yugoslavia. The invitation was accepted.

Under an agreement concluded by the two governments in Belgrade, payments of the principal falling due between 1st January 1985 and 15th May 1986 are rescheduled. The agreement provides for the granting of a credit to Yugoslavia of 45,000,000 Danish crowns which has been approved.

The two countries signed an agreement in Belgrade on 5th March, 1987, on deferring the payment of Yugoslavia's debt to Denmark due in the period between 16th May 1986 and the end of 1988. Under the agreement, Denmark has made a 53,000,000 crown refinancing loan to Yugoslavia.

Danish Foreign Minister, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen arrived for a two-day official visit to Yugoslavia on 27th October, 1988. In talks on the same day, Ellemann-Jensen and his opposite number Budimir Loncar assessed that bilateral relations were stable, but ought to be more substantial, particularly in the sphere of economic co-operation. The barely 100,000,000 dollar trade exchange last year gave rise to dissatisfaction on both sides, because the countries' economies were capable of offering more. The Danish side expressed particular satisfaction with the signing, during the visit, of an agreement on the reciprocal execution of court decisions, whereby convicted persons will be able to serve their prison terms in their own countries. In their talks on international topics, the two sides focused their attention on trends in Europe, with special emphasis on economic integration and the CSCE process. Ellemann-Jensen confirmed that Denmark supports Yugoslavia's demands in the EEC relating to the possibilities of promoting its co-operation with the Twelve. Yugoslavia and Denmark also welcomed the new climate of detente which had facilitated important, albeit only initial, steps of disarmament. Talks in the afternoon between the two Foreign Ministers were due to deal with the non-aligned movement, the positive development of relations between Moscow and Washington, crisis areas, the North-South dialogue and the developing countries' overindebtedness. 

On the same day Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was received by Raif Dizdarevic, President of the SFRY Presidency. The two sides noted that economic co-operation was lagging behind realistic possibilities and needs and voiced interest in establishing more regular dialogue on inter-governmental level. Special stress was laid on Yugoslavia's interest in the consolidation of relations with the EEC. The talks were attended by Budimir Loncar. 

The countries' Foreign Ministers had further talks on the 28th October, 1988, concerning bilateral economic co-operation. In a toast at a luncheon in honor of his Danish guest, Budimir Loncar said that Yugoslavia wished to strengthen cooperation with the EEC, with full recognition of Yugoslavia's position as a European, Mediterranean and developing country. The wide gap between the North and South was the main source of problems in international relations, Loncar pointed out, adding that trends to step up dialogue elevated small and medium sized countries to significant positions on the global scene. In reply, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen noted that his country wished to continually promote comprehensive relations with Yugoslavia and strongly supported the SFRY's demands relating to its co-operation with the EEC. Noting that eight years had passed since the last meeting between Yugoslav and Danish Foreign Ministers, Ellemann-Jensen invited Budimir Loncar to visit Denmark ''as soon as possible''. The Danish Minister ended his friendly visit the same afternoon and left Belgrade by special aircraft.

Leaders of Nordic nations gathered for a summit here reaffirmed their commitment on August 15, 1995, to keeping peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia despite the deterioration of the Balkans situation. Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland all said they would not pull out troops unilaterally despite the escalation of fighting in Bosnia through the summer and the Croatian offensive earlier this month in the formerly Serb-held Krajina region. "We will not withdraw our soldiers unilaterally," Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said. "It is the United Nations, and it alone which can decide to keep them (peacekeepers and observers) there or withdraw them." The informal three-day summit in this western Greenland town brought Rasmussen together with his Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish counterparts-David Oddsson, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Ingvar Carlsson. Denmark has 1,300 soldiers and observers in former Yugoslavia, as against Sweden's 1,201, Norway's 892 and Finland's 486.

On August 16th, 1995, Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic has appealed to the Danish government to unfreeze Yugoslav funds in Danish banks to allow humanitarian aid for the Serb Krajina refugees. Kontic's letter to Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was handed over to Deputy Permanent Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Niels Egelund by Yugoslav charge d'affaires in Denmark, Vladan Skoric. Skoric informed the senior Danish official about the difficult humanitarian situation in which the Serb Krajina people found themselves following Croatia's offensive and about the measures taken by the Yugoslav government to assist the refugees. Skoric also asked Egelund that Denmark send humanitarian aid to the refugees living in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The Danish governments on April 12, 1996, became the latest to recognize the rump Yugoslavia, now Serbia and Montenegro. In Copenhagen, the Danish government said it too would open diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, but it said that future bilateral relations between Denmark and Yugoslavia would depend on the evolution of the peace process. Denmark also wants Belgrade to take back 1,700 Serbian deserters stranded in Denmark after Serbia "refused to authorize their return," Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said. Belgrade must also make concessions to greater autonomy for Kosovo Albanians, he said.

The first MID of RIV915, MID4137 engaged Denmark starting with June 11th, 1998.

The last MID of RIV915, MID4343 ended on November 28th, 2000.

Yugoslavia counts on Denmark's support in solving the Kosovo problem and stop the violence in southern Serbia, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic said on December 13, 2000. He held talks with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen in Belgrade. The Yugoslav minister noted that Denmark should play a special role in stabilizing the situation in the region due to the appointment of former Danish defense minister Hans Hakkenrup as head of the U.N. civil mission in Kosovo. Svilanovic said that Yugoslavia is ready to make any contribution to Hakkenrup, who will take office in January. The minister believes that the talks with his Danish counterpart will facilitate close cooperation not only between the two countries but also between the Yugoslav government and the U.N. mission in Kosovo. Petersen noted that the new head of the U.N. mission knows well the region and is ready to carry out his tasks with all responsibility. Denmark will join the program of helping restore the energy sector of Serbia and intend to support the activity of non-governmental organizations of the country and independent press.

The Danish national police have now begun sending home 900 refugees from Serbia-Montenegro who have been refused asylum. An agreement between the Danish and Serbian authorities from 8 March, 2003, means that the rejected asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia-who came to Denmark at the end of the 1990s-are now to be sent home. Over the last few weeks the national police have submitted about 100 cases to the authorities in Belgrade, who have a deadline for formally acknowledging receiving the country's former citizens. Deputy National Police Chief Hans Viggo Jensen tells DR Nyheder Danish radio news that a small group of asylum seekers has already been escorted to Belgrade on so-called 'compulsory expulsions' and that more will follow over the next few weeks.

The Danish Army Operative Command has decided to cut its peacekeeping force in Kosovo by 113 soldiers-a quarter-so that in August 2003 there will only be about 350 Danish soldiers left in KFOR, which is under NATO command. Denmark has had troops posted to Kosovo since 1999. When the Danish contribution was at its peak more than 700 Danes were stationed in two different camps-Camp Holger Danske and Camp Olaf Rye-in the Serbian and Albanian parts of the town of Mitrovica respectively. The 113 soldiers who are being withdrawn are a reconnaissance corps, an anti-tank weapon squad and a few mechanics and so-called signals personnel. According to the Danish Army Operative Command the decision should be seen as part of NATO's general reduction of the total number of soldiers in KFOR because of the improved situation and stability in the area. Shortly after the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia in the summer of 1999 NATO decided to send a total of 45,000 soldiers from 28 different countries to Kosovo to bring security to the tense situation between Kosovo and Serbia.

Denmark's prime minister on October 23, 2003, pledged to support Serbia in its efforts to eventually join the European Union, but warned that the republic must push ahead with reforms and help bring war crimes suspects to justice. Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, leading a delegation of government officials and Danish investors, spoke after talks with his Serbian counterpart, Zoran Zivkovic. "I am impressed by the progress made here in Serbia," Fogh Rasmussen said. "Denmark supports Serbia's European aspirations," he said. "But there is still some work to do." In particular, he noted that before the Balkan country can apply for EU membership, it should take steps toward "a stable democracy, strong institutions, rule of law (and) respect for human rights and minorities." He also stressed that Serbia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal if it is to be welcomed by the West. "War criminals should be brought to justice," Fogh Rasmussen said. Serbia's current, pro-Western government toppled former autocratic president, Slobodan Milosevic, in 2000 and then extradited him and scores of his lieutenants to the court in The Hague, Netherlands, to answer charges related to the Balkan wars of the 1990s. The court earlier this week indicted four Serb generals who led the fighting in Kosovo and is urging the government to hand over other suspects still at large. The government said that although it wants to cooperate, it won't arrest the four because the indictments come at a difficult time: nationalist opponents are trying to topple the government by calling a vote of confidence in parliament. The vote is expected to occur in the next weeks. Zivkovic acknowledged that Serbia "must meet its international obligations" and urged Danish business leaders to seek opportunities in Serbia. The republic, he said, "has become a safe place for foreign investors."

Although Zivkovic's government has enacted some democratic reforms since it came to power in 2000, it still is plagued by corruption, political fighting and influence peddling. The former prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, was assassinated in March. Fogh Rasmussen arrived in Belgrade after a visit to Kosovo, the southern province that has been under NATO and U.N. control since the 1999 war there. In Kosovo, Rasmussen visited Danish troops serving as peacekeepers in the troubled province.

Denmark said on April 23, 2004, that it reached an agreement with the U.N. war crimes tribunal that will let people from the former Yugoslavia convicted by the court serve their sentences in the Scandinavian country's prisons. The convicts likely would serve in some of Denmark's high-security prisons. The agreement was retroactive, meaning anyone convicted by the tribunal since Jan. 1, 2004, can be incarcerated in Denmark. Neighboring Sweden and Finland have similar agreements with the Hague, Netherlands-based tribunal. In 1994, Denmark's Supreme Court sentenced Refic Saric, a Bosnian Muslim, to eight years in prison for his role in 14 cases of violently mistreating and assaulting fellow inmates, two of whom died, in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1993. He served his time in Denmark.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller suggested on May 19, 2005, that the process to resolve the political status of Kosovo could produce a solution by mid-2006. Moeller arrived in the province's capital Pristina after talks with leaders in Belgrade where he said that the future solution for the troubled province must be acceptable to both Kosovo and Serbia. Denmark this month chairs the U.N. Security Council which will discuss Kosovo next week. The troubled province, where independence-seeking ethnic Albanians are a majority, is currently run by the United Nations and NATO peacekeepers. Moeller said the Security Council was expected to begin discussion on Kosovo's final status around September. "My hope is and I'm working for an end of that discussion in nine months time," he said. U.N.-sponsored talks to determine Kosovo's future could start as early as September if the province's leaders fulfill a list of U.N.-set standards for democracy and protection of minorities. In Kosovo, he met with Kosovo's president Ibrahim Rugova and Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi. Kosovo formally remains part of Serbia-Montenegro, Yugoslavia's successor state, but has been an international protectorate since the 1999 NATO bombing halted Serbia's crackdown on separatist ethnic Albanians and forced Belgrade to relinquish control over Kosovo to the United Nations and the alliance.
