COUPLINK: MID3058 1 -- coup link
COUPLINK-CER: MID3058 1 -- certain 
COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3058 from MID-B data, this is a multilateral MID involving many Caribbean nations and the US against Cuba and Grenada. From cm narrative, the US landed several thousand troops in Grenada when a coup by the deputy Prime Minister deposed the Prime Minister. A military council took power. From Facts on File (vol. XLIII pg. 787), several Caribbean nations condemned the coup in Grenada and refused to have relations with the new government, while Cuba supported the new government and condemned the US invasion. The widespread condemnations trigger MIDs between Grenada and many Caribbean nations, and between Cuba and many Caribbean nations since Cuba supported this coup. Coded coup link because the coup in Grenada is outside of this dyad and leads to a MID between Cuba, a supporter of the coup, and Barbados, a denouncer of the coup.
