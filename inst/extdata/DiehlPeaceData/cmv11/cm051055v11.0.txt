TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3058 from cm002055v11.0 narrative, MID3058 is the US and CARICOM-backed invasion of Grenada. Some CARICOM members cut diplomatic ties with Grenada and put economic sanctions on Grenada. At the same time the threat of military intervention, including by some CARICOM member-states was present. Coded not third party link to territory because the US invasion of Grenada, which Jamaica supported, was not a territorial dispute but was a US operation to evacuate Americans.

COUPMID: MID3058 1 -- coup MID
COUPMID-CER: MID3058 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: MID3058 from MID-B data, this is a multilateral MID involving many Caribbean nations and the US against Cuba and Grenada. From cm narrative, the US landed several thousand troops in Grenada when a coup by the deputy Prime Minister deposed the Prime Minister. A military council took power. From Facts on File (vol. XLIII pg. 787), several Caribbean nations condemned the coup in Grenada and refused to have relations with the new government, while Cuba supported the new government and condemned the US invasion. The widespread condemnations trigger MIDs between Grenada and many Caribbean nations. Coded coup MID because the coup in Grenada is within this dyad and leads to a MID between Jamaica, a denouncer of the coup, and Grenada. 

COUPLINK: MID3058 3 -- not coup link
COUPLINK-CER: MID3058 1 -- certain 
COUPLINK-NOTES: MID3058 no coups in any other countries involved in this MID.
