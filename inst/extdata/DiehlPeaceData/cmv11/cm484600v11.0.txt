CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from Gibler 2018, Zaire was being invaded by rebels seeking refuge primarily in Angola. France, Belgium, Egypt, and Morocco offered military support to Zaire to fight against the rebels, pulling them into this MID on the same side as Zaire and against Cuba and Angola who were backing the rebels. Coded civil war link because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Zaire, outside this dyad, but coded uncertain because Gibler 2018 does not consider Congo Brazzaville a party to this dispute.
