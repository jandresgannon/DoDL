CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3953 Gibler 2018, cattle herders from Mauritania and Senegal clashed with each other over resource scarcity. This led to clashes between both countries who were each trying to protect their respective citizens. Coded not civil war because although the civilians involved were engaging in deadly force, they were not militarized against their own or the other country's government. They took up arms to fight against other non-state groups due to resource scarcity.
