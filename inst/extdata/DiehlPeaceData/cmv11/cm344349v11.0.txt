On 08/06/2002 a Croatian coast guard vessel escorts Slovenian fishing vessels, accompanied by a Slovenian police boat, out of what Croatia claims was its territorial waters. Slovenia protested the incident and claims that the Croatian vessel was actually in Slovenian waters. In the time preceding the incident, each side had claimed its territorial waters had been frequently violated by foreign fishing vessels. The two sides came to an agreement on the demarcation of maritime borders in July 2001, but the settlement was not ratified by Croatian parliament. On 8/23/2002, the Croatian foreign minister agreed to meet with his/her Slovene counterpart to reduce the tension over maritime borders. First day of dispute was on 8/6/2002 and last day of dispute was on 8/6/2002.
