TMB Notes: When we code WWII MID1694, it is terrlink=1, certainty=1, notes=MID1694 This is a MID embedded within WWII. On 21 January 1942, Japan signed a treaty with Thailand; the latter then declared war on the United Kingdom on 25 January 1942 (Brecher & Wilkenfeld 2000, 407). From NYT 6/14/1942, Japan had invaded Thailand and used it as one of its base of operations. During the period 1942-1945 (date range of MID1694), Thailand was under Japan's sovereignty, and Japan, being at war with the Allied Powers, threatened Australia, who was allied with the US and Europe. See also NYT 3/4/1942 for evidence of Japanese threat to Australia. Coded third party link because this was connected to WWII in which a series of territorial claims were being made.
