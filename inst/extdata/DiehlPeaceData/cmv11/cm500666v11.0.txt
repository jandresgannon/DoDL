CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1377 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked an Air France plane with many Israeli passengers aboard and demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Uganda allowed the plane to land in Uganda, and the Israeli military launched an attack on the Ugandan airport and killed about 20 Ugandan troops. Israel claims the PFLP are terrorists. Coded civil war MID because the PFLP conducts sustained, organized, militarized attacks against Israel. It is therefore an organized, militarized rebel group that targets Israel, a state within this dyad.
