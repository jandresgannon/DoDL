MID1793

TERRMID: MID1793 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1793 from Gibler 2018, in 1947-1948, Israelis and Palestinians disputed who would control the area that is modern-day Israel. The Israelis declared independence and sovereignty over the land in 1948, and a coalition of Arab nations (Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan) attacked Israel that same day because they denied Israel's claim to sovereignty and wanted a Palestine state. A war broke out, and Israel emerged victorious in 1949. Coded territorial MID because Syria disputed Israel's claim to the territory that become Israel. 

TERRLINK: MID1793 1 -- third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1793 in this dyad, the TERRMID is between Syria and Israel, but this MID also involves a territorial MID between Israel and the other Arab states outside this dyad. 

MARITMID: MID1793 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain
MARITMID-NOTES: MID1793 the dispute between Israel and the Arab nations involved in this dispute (Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon) also included a dispute concerning sovereignty over the waters off the coast of what is current-day Israel.

ISLMID-NOTES: 

CIVWARMID: MID1793 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1793 this MID involves fighting between Israelis and Palestinians before a state was created. Thus, the militarized groups were non-state armed groups fighting for control of the state, making them militarized rebels per our coding scheme.

TERRMID: MID3445 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID3445 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3445 from Gibler 2018, in 1949 Israel and Syria were attempting to negotiate a ceasefire when Israel violated Syria's borders, disrupting the talks. Syria threatened to use force. Per Huth and Allee 2002, Israel and Syria were disputing several pieces of territory after Israel claimed territories beyond the 1947 borders drawn by the UN. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to disputed territory. 

TERRLINK: MID3445 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID3445 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3445 Other Arab states have territorial disputes with Israel at this time, but the events of this MID do not connect to those disputes.

MID3411

TERRMID: MID3411 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID3411 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3411 from Gibler 2018, in 1950 Israeli police boats became entangled in a Syrian fishing net. Jewish civilians approached to help and were fired upon by Syrian border guards. Israel also protested that Syrian troops crossed the border and stole livestock from Jewish farmers. Per Huth and Allee 2002, Israel and Syria were disputing borders, since Israel claimed several pieces of territory beyond the lines drawn by the UN in 1947. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to disputed territory along the Jordan River, an inland river boundary. 

TERRLINK: MID3411 3 -- not third party link to territory

TERRMID: MID3400 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID3400 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3400 from Gibler 2018, this MID describes some of the same events as MID3411 but is still considered a distinct MID. In 1950, an Israeli patrol boat was entangled in Syrian fishing nets. When Israeli fishermen approached to help, they were fired upon by Syrian border guards. Per Huth and Allee 2002, Syria and Israel had several territorial disputes at the time, since Israel expanded its borders beyond the 1947 UN lines. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute (the incident happened at a portion of the disputed border, and the tensions between Israel and Syria were directly connected to the territorial dispute).

TERRMID-CER: MID3427 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3427 from Gibler 2018, in 1951 Israel and Syria had a series of incidents connected to disputed pieces of territory that were set up as demilitarized zones at the time. Israeli and Syrian forces clashed at Lake Hullah, which was disputed, and at Tel al Mutilla, also disputed. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to disputed territory.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3401 from Gibler 2018, in 1951 an Israeli border patrol was fired upon by a Syrian outpost. Per Huth and Allee 2002, they were disputing their borders at the time. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute.

TERRMID-CER: MID3413 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3413 from Gibler 2018, Israeli fishermen were fired upon by Syrian troops in the Sea of Galilee, which was being disputed at the time. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute. The Sea of Galilee is not considered to be a maritime issue because it is an inland body of river though which the Jordan River, an inland river boundary, flows.

MARITMID-CER: MID3414 1 -- certain
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3414 from Gibler 2018, in 1952 Syria fired on an Israeli fishing boat. Per Huth and Allee 2002, the states were disputing territory, but this MID does not seem to be connected to the disputed territory. It seems to be a product of general tensions between Israel and Syria. Neither Gibler 2018 nor the New York Times coverage of these incidents (NYT 1/30/1952, 1/10/1952) mentions disputed territory/maritime space, nor do the governments in their public statements.

TERRMID-CER: MID3402 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3402 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, in 1952 Syria declared that the Middle East was 'not large enough for both Arabs and Jews.' Israel took this as a threat and protested. Coded somewhat territory because this was tangentially related to the active territorial dispute, and coded uncertain because GML recommend the case be dropped as it does not constitute a true threat.

TERRMID-CER: MID3428 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3428 from Gibler 2018, Jordan and Syria agreed to a plan for water sharing from the Yamuk River in 1953. Israel protested this agreement and began building facilities for water resources in several locations on the river, including in one of the disputed demilitarized zones. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to disputed territory. 

TERRLINK: MID3428 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID3428 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3428 Israel and Jordan had an active territorial dispute at this time (Huth and Allee 2002). They disputed several small demilitarized zones until the conclusion of the 1967 war. However, those disputed zones were not the same zones as the ones disputed between Israel and Syria. (There was no overlap in territory claimed by Syria and Jordan.) There is no indication in cm narrative, Gibler 2018, or news coverage of this MID that suggests Israel's dispute with Jordan contributed to the events of this MID. In their public statements, neither country referenced the Israel-Jordan dispute (NYT 10/31/1953).

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3417 from Gibler 2018, from 1953-1958 a series of disputes occurred over water rights to the Jordan River (an inland river boundary), in an area of disputed territory. Israel entered the demilitarized zone and began constructing a canal. A series of clashes occurred. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute.

Although there was an active territorial dispute at this time (Huth and Allee 2002), there is no indication that this MID was directly connected to that disputed territory. Neither Gibler 2018 nor the New York Times coverage of this incident mention the disputed territory (NYT 3/16/1954).

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3415 from Gibler 2018, in 1954 Syria seized an Israeli vessel in the Mediterranean, and Israel responded by seizing a Syrian plane and its crew. From New York Times (8/16/1954, 12/15/1954), these seizures did not happen in disputed territory. However, Syria claimed that this was connected to a border skirmish that had occurred at their disputed border in December. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to their territorial dispute.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3418 from Gibler 2018, in 1955 Israel accused Syria of firing on Israeli fishing vessels in the Sea of Galilee (inland territory/not maritime boundary). Syria then fired on Israeli planes that flew over the demilitarized zones, areas which were disputed and had been agreed by both parties to refrain from entering.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3416 from Gibler 2018, in 1955 Israel seized a Syrian ship that was trying to reach Gaza. Coded not territory because Syria did not claim Gaza. Gaza was being disputed between Israel and Egypt, but Syria was not trying to interfere in this dispute or help Egypt. Syria was attempting to bring medical aid to Palestinians, per New York Times (8/6/1955).

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3416 This MID involved Gaza, an area disputed by Israel and Egypt (outside this dyad), but per New York Times 8/6/1955, Syria was not trying to become involved in that dispute. It was instead trying to deliver medical aid supplies to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

TERRMID-CER: MID3419 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3419 from Gibler 2018, Israel claimed the waters in the Sea of Galilee as within their territorial waters but this was disputed by Egypt and Syria. Syrian fishermen continued to fish in the waters, often provoking clashes between Israel and Syria. At this time, Syria and Egypt were both members of the United Arab Republic, pulling Egypt into this MID, although the clashes were between Israeli and Syrian jets. Coded territrial MID because this was connected to a dispute over the Sea of Galilee, and this is considered a territorial dispute, since the sea is an inland body of water through which the Jordan River, an inland river boundary, flows.

This also involves a dispute over diversion of water from the Jordan River, also disputed territory. Separately, Israeli and Syrian forces clashed in a demilitarized and disputed zone at the Huleh Valley. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to several disputed pieces of territory.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3433 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this is another MID that should be folded into MID3434 due to temporal overlap and description of the same events. From Gibler 2018, a series of clashes from 1961-1966 occurred at the disputed border near the Sea of Galilee. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute, a disputed land boundary near the Sea of Galilee. Coded uncertain because GML recommend this case be dropped.

Israeli troops exchanged fire with Syrian gunmen who had entered Israel via the ISR-SYR border. The Israelis killed one and captured another. Syria claimed they were police simply looking for a drink of water, while Israel countered that they were Syrian soldiers disguised as civilians on an infiltration mission.

NO MILITARIZED ACTION 

Israel and Syria experienced tensions due to Syrias support for Hezbollah and various other rebel groups operating against Israel (MID4182). In one incident, Israeli planes buzzed the palace of Syrian president Bashar al- Assad, perhaps as a show of potential attack capabilities against the Syrian capital. In another, Israel bombed a Palestinian militant training in Syria camp after a suicide attack in Israel. Israel also staged military exercises on the border with Syria in a clear show of force against the Syrian government and their policies. First day of dispute was on 8/17/2003 and last day of dispute was on 11/14/2003.

USE OF FORCE 

Largely in a continuation of the underlying issues of MID4512, Israeli warplanes buzzed the summer residence of Syrian president Bashar al- Assad. Syrian anti-air defenses opened fire on the Israeli planes in response. Syria also put its forces on alert during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and both countries threatened to use force against the other if they initiated a military action. First day of dispute was on 8/17/2003 and last day of dispute was on 11/14/2003.

MID3 1993-2001:

MID4182 IS A THIRTEEN YEAR LONG DISPUTE, AND SYRIA VIS-A-VIS OSCILLATES IN AND OUT OF THE DISPUTE IN THIS PERIOD. THOSE PERIODS (WHICH ARE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS APART) ARE NOTED BELOW BUT THE COW NARRATIVE IS THE SAME FOR ALL:

This dispute contains hundreds of militarized incidents between, primarily, Israel and Lebanon. Syria sporadically participated on the side of the Lebanese. Virtually all of the incidents occur when Israel attacks Hezbollah guerillas in Southern Lebanon in response to Hezbollah attacks on Israeli troops. Israeli violations of the Lebanese border, in an effort to monitor Hezbollah activities, are also common. Lebanon repeatedly protests the incursions, and often fights with the Hezbollah guerillas when the Israeli forces attack. The dispute begins in 1993 and continues through December 2001 with remarkably little change in the character of the incidents. The dispute is, therefore, still ongoing with no outcome or settlement.

The US facilitated negotiations between Israeli and Syrian representatives in Washington DC between December 10, 1991 and April 1992. The US mediated negotiations between Israeli and Syrian representatives in Shepherdstown, West Virginia beginning on January 3, 2000.

The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006 because the main issue of contention: the existence of Israel; the ownership of the Golan Heights have not been solved yet. The 2006 invasion by Israel of Lebanon has exacerbated the tensions between Syria and Israel even more.

SB-CR:
Israel / Syria Years: 1948-Present. Issues at stake: Existence of Israel; border (Golan Heights); Syrian/Israeli presence in Lebanon. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 21. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1985 (in dispute data set; more recent disputes have occurred). Wars: 1948-1949, 1967, 1973. Summary: The roots of the Israeli-Syrian rivalry lie in the circumstances of Israel's creation (see summary under Israeli-Egyptian rivalry above). Syria refused to recognize Israel as a legitimate state, and refused to ratify its borders with Israel. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel captured the Golan Heights on Israel's northeastern border. Border confrontations have occurred both before and after the capture of the Golan Heights. A 1974 Israel-Syria disengagement agreement returned to Syria additional territory captured by Israel in the 1973 war, but not the Golan Heights. After the Lebanese civil war of 1975, disputes have also occurred over Lebanon, where Syria and Israel have supported different factions. Israeli forces fought with Syrian forces (particularly Air Force and air defense units) during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. In the 1980s disputes have occurred more often over Lebanon and the continuing Israeli presence in its self-declared "security zone" than over the direct border. However, Syria has continued to demand the return of the Golan as well as Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. The Israelis demand Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, and are resistant to returning the Golan Heights from which the Syrians have easy access to Israel's northern territories. This dyad is one of the most disputatious of all rivalries, both in frequency and in total number of disputes, although there have been fewer wars than in the Egyptian-Israeli rivalry. No settlement of the disputed issues has yet been reached. Notes: Peace talks between Israel, Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians began in 1992, but have not produced settlement yet (1993). The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006 because the main issue of contention: the existence of Israel; the ownership of the Golan Heights have not been solved yet. The 2006 invasion by Israel of Lebanon has exacerbated the tensions between Syria and Israel even more. Sources: Goldstein (1992), Information Please Almanac (1991).
