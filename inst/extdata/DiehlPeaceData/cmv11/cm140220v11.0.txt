MARITMID-NOTES: MID624 from MID-B data, this MID has date 4/1963. From NYT 3.4.1963, Brazil and France had a dispute over fishing rights near the Brazilian Coast. More specifically, France was fishing for lobsters near Brazil, which Brazil protested, and Brazil seized several lobster fishing vessels. France claimed lobsters are fish and therefore international fishing law grants them the right to fish in that area, while Brazil claims lobsters are "crawlers" and thus subject to the same laws as oil and other resources under the continental shelf. Coded not maritime because this was a fishing, or crawling, dispute.
