*Middle East Journal *(MEJ), Spring 1986, 315.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Cyprus and Iraq is wholly a product of the Iran-Iraq War. Both Iran and Iraq put pressure on the opponent's oil assets during the war - especially from 1984 until 1988. Iraq attacked Cypriot tankers when they were carrying Iranian oil and at times attacked Cypriot tankers by mistake. This period was a dangerous time for any tanker in the region as they were all targets for both Iran and Iraq. In fact Cypriot tankers were also the frequent target of Iran during this period. Iraq attacked Cypriot tankers in the Persian Gulf numerous times from 1984 until the war's end in 1988. The individual attacks are listed below. The attacks ceased when Iran and Iraq ended their war in 1988. This removed the incentive to attack assets of the opponent. 

MID3043 occurred on 22 Aug 1984. Iraq attached the Cypriot tanker Amethyst with missiles. The missile holed the starboard tank setting fire to that tankers accommodations and engine rooms. Oil spilled out and caught fire. This attack occurred south of Kharg Island. 

MID2584 occurred from December 1985 through March of 1986. This mid covers a series of Iraqi attacks on Cypriot oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. In December Iraqis attacked the Polis. The vessel was heavily loaded and was hit by an Exocet missile south of Kharg Island. The Polis continued to saild unders it won power. On January 1st, Iraqis attacked the Cypriot tanker Superior with missiles that did not explode. In late February, Iraqis attacked the Cypriot tanker Polikon. In March Iraqis attacked the Cypriot tanker Achievement causing fires in the engine room and crew accommodations. Iraqis also attacked the Cypriot tanker Superior in March casing some damage. 

MID2595 occurred in October of 1986. Iraqis attacked the Cypriot tanker Angel in the Persian Gulf. 

MID2824 occurred from December of 1987 until May of 1988. This mid also covers a series of Iraqi attacks on Cypriot oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. On December 2nd and 4th Iraq attacked Cypriot tankers Anax and Acttinia. On 12 December Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker Pirot carrying a full load of Saudi oil. The tanker caught fire. On 16 December Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker Mimi M in the Southern part of the Persian Gulf. On 11 January 1988, Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker United Venture in the central Gulf with two Exocet missiles while carrying a cargo of gasoline. The ship sustained extreme damage and some of the crew were killed. On 27 January Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker Coral Cope 14 miles off the Iranian coast. The Cypriots sustained casualties but the tanker was not severely damaged. On March 8, Iraqis attacked the Cypriot tanker Felicity in the Northern part of the Persian Gulf. On March 18, Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker Kyrenicol. The tanker was hit by Iraqi aircraft fire. On March 30, Iraq attacked the Cypriot tanker Anax.
