TERRMID-NOTES: MID4177 from Gibler 2018, in 1999 Uzbek troops crossed into Kyrgyzstan and began building fortified positions around Kyrgyz oil wells. Kyrgyzstan asked them to leave, and they complied. Coded not territory because they were not disputing a boundary. Per the official state newspaper of Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyzstan was puzzled by the incident, but did not interpret it as a border claim. Uzbekistan also did not make any public statement suggesting this was about claiming territory (BBC 4/11/1999). After the Uzbek construction crews and troops left, Kyrgyzstan considered the matter settled, and this did not re-occur.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID4428 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4428 from Gibler 2018 and cm narrative, in 2005 approximately 500 Uzbek citizens crossed into Kyrgyzstan, and Kyrgyzstan reinforced their border in response. Coded civil war MID because clashes days earlier in Uzbekistan led to a refugee influx into Kyrygyzstan (Associated Press 5/16/2005; Xinhua News Agency 5/26/2005). (The refugees are simply referred to as "civilians" in cm narrative and Gibler 2018.) The refugee flow that is connected to the border closure here is therefore directly connected to militarized rebel activity in Uzbekistan, within this dyad.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4430 from cm narrative and Gibler 2018, Uzbek citizens crossed into Kyrgyzstan and attacked a border checkpoint, prompting Kyrgyzstan to reinforce its border. Coded not civil war because there is no indication that the citizens were militarized rebels. Per BBC 12/14/2005, the Kyrgyz who approached the border checkpoint were drunken locals who did not want Uzbek troops in the area.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4432 from cm narrative and Gibler 2018, Kyrgyz border guards fired upon Uzbeks accused of entering Kyrgyz territory. Coded not civil war because there is no indication that the citizens were militarized rebels. News from Kyrgyz news outlets claim that the civilians were merely herders moving their cattle (text of Kyrgyz news agency story from BBC 9/27/2006). Russian news agencies say that the Kyrgyz civilians tried to grab the border guards' rifles, forcing them to defend themselves by firing (Russia & CIS Military Newswire). Neither side claims that militarized rebels were involved.

TERRMID-CER: MID4442 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4442 the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border is quite convoluted at some points due to an effort at grouping citizens by ethnicity when the borders were drawn. However, ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz live on either side of the border in some places, contributing to communal tensions at those locations. The Uzbek president declared himself the protector of all ethnic Uzbeks, even if resided in Kyrgyzstan (IHS Global Insight). However, there is no indication in Gibler 2018, Huth and Allee 2002, cm narrative, or news coverage of this MID that the border was disputed. Coded not territory because this was connected to ethnic tensions, not a border dispute.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4442 from cm narrative and Gibler 2018, border guards from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan become engaged in a clash on Kyrgyz territory. There were no casualties. Later, on June 12, 2010, Uzbekistan fortifies its border with Kyrgyzstan, citing unrest in Kyrgyzstan. Coded civil war MID because per MID4426 narrative, there were militarized rebels in Kyrgyzstan, contributing to the unrest there.
