MARITMID-NOTES: MID1702 from cm narrative, all MIDs in this dyad are triggered by Ecuador seizing US fishing boats. The two countries disagreed on the location of Ecuador's maritime boundary. Ecuador asserted it had sovereignty over all waters 200 miles from its coast, while the US asserted that Ecuador only controlled waters 12 miles off the Ecuadorian coast. As a result, the US routinely sent fishing vessels into waters between 12 and 200 miles off the Ecuadorian coast, and Ecuador periodically seized the boats and demanded fine payments. Whether Ecuador seized the boats or looked the other way largely depended on whether the current regime was US-friendly. Coded maritime MID because the countries disagreed about Ecuador's maritime boundary and the US fishing vessels were seized in these disputed waters. The maritime issue was salient to both countries due to valuable fishing resources.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Ecuadorian naval ships seized one United States fishing vessel near its coast on June 18, 1969, and seized four US fishing vessels near its coast on June 20, 1969. Ecuador release the US fishing vessels after fines were paid on June 20, 1969. 

SOURCES-CM:
*Facts on File*, June 26-July 2, 1969.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The US-Ecuador rivalry centered around the issue of fishing rights off of the Ecuadorian coast. In 1950 Ecuador proclaimed sovereign rights over a 200 mile zone off of its coastline. This was in part due to the US claim of jurisdiction over all resources on its continental shelf in 1945, which for the first time challenged the freedom of the seas doctrine in place during the period. All of the MIDs from 1952 to 1981 (MID1702 MID1705 MID3242 MID1803 MID1805 MID1158 MID602 MID3105) were due to Ecuadorean seizures of US fishing boats which, according to Ecuador, were encroaching upon its exclusive economic zone as stated by the Santiago Declaration of 1952 and the 1958 Law of the Sea Treaty. The United States did not recognize these claims and only recognized a 12 mile limit for Ecuador. The seizures by Ecuador had been done in cycles depending on whether the government in power was friendly or not to US interests. The rivalry reached its most intense point during the Velasco administration in 1971 when Velasco in an effort to restore some of his popularity domestically seized and fined around 100 US fishing boats within the 200 mile zone, collecting more than $6 million in US dollars. As a result, The United States withdrew practically all of its military and economic aid while Ecuador dismissed all US military advisers. Since the last mid in 1981 which led to a US embargo of Ecuadorian tuna, a new Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 (in force on November 16, 1994) along with improved relations probably has ended the rivalry. It should be noted though that neither Ecuador or the United States is a signatory to the Law of the Sea Convention as of June 2003, suggesting that improved relations have helped bring the rivalry to a close. 

During the 1980s, Ecuadorian president Febres Cordero closely aligned his foreign and economic policies with that of President Ronald Reagan's, especially those policies regarding US interests in Central America and international debt by Latin American countries as highlighted in the Baker Plan. In 1983, Cordero's government even broke relations with the Nicaraguan Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega, reacting to a US request to blockade international aid to Nicaragua. Cordero also allowed for the US sponsored "Operation Blazing Trails" which involved US troops to repair bridges and roads in Ecuador. In 1986, Cordero even made a week-long visit to Washington to show support for the Reagan administration and bilateral relations between the two countries. In 1988 under the Borja administration, the United States gave Ecuador US$48 milllion in assistance to Ecuador and was Ecuador's leading economic partner. In 1989, Ecuador approved the US proposed Brady Plan that provided a portion of debt to be removed for poor countries in exchange for guaranteed repayment of the remaining debt. Although the fishing issue is unresolved, it has not seemingly been a barrier to normal US-Ecuadorian relations, leading to the suspicion that the rivalry is over or not likely to take on any major significance in the two countries' relations as it did in 1971.

SB-CR:
US / Ecuador Years: 1952-1988 (Censored) Issues at stake: Territorial waters limits; specifically, disputes over fishing rights. US desire to influence Ecuador's policies. End Date: Ongoing as of 1988, no real settlement as the US and Ecuador still disagree over the issue of territorial limits, although recent conflicts have been minimal or non-existent. Number of militarized disputes: 7. Number of 30 day reciprocated militarized disputes: 1. Last militarized dispute: 1972. Wars: None. Summary: The entire period of the rivalry covers several turbulent periods in Ecuador's history. A series of coups and counter-coups in Ecuador through this period demonstrated political instability; the US generally sought through the period to influence Ecuadorian policy so that it reflected a pro-Western, anti-Communist stance. US policies included aiding pro-Western regimes that came into power, causing some elites to resent US interference. Resentment was also fueled in some cases by conditions attached to US aid and the Rio Protocol. Among the specific issues, the US hoped for a pro-US regime in Ecuador which would not attempt to enforce Ecuador's claim to a 200 mile fishing limit. The specific point of contention that has been voiced repeatedly is Ecuador's claim that fish represent an economic resource, it has jurisdiction over a 200 mile area from its coast. While both the US and Ecuador accept an unconditional 12 mile territorial limit, the US does not accept Ecuador's claims about 200 mile control, and has continued to encourage fishing by US fishing fleets inside the 200 mile zone. The US government enacted legislation in the mid-1970s under which it pays the costs of any fishermen fined by Ecuador for incursions in this area. Ecuador's policy regarding enforcement of the limit has varied by administration. For example, between 1952 and 1956 a few US ships were captured and detained, between 1956 and 1960 a pro-US government did not capture any vessels, between 1960 and 1963 a large number of seizures took place, few seizures occurred under the military regime from 1963 to 1966, and an upsurge in seizures again took place after the junta fell in 1966. The various rounds of the seizures have earned the name of the *Tuna Wars* between Ecuador and the US. Fluctuations in policy continued through the 1970s, with a shift in attention to oil in the early 1970s being followed by new seizures in the mid 1970s. Conflict over fishing rights also continued in the 1980s, with a ship seizure in 1981 (one which is not listed in the COW militarized dispute data base) and a US Congressional renewal in 1986 and 1987 of the act paying fines incurred by US vessels when fishing in foreign waters. With that renewal the US clearly restated its position on the issue of territorial limits, while Ecuador in Law of the Sea documents still claims 200 miles as its *exclusive economic zone.* Other minor issues of dispute arose in the 1980s, with the US blocking the sale of jets to Ecuador in 1983 and joining in human rights criticism of Ecuador in 1988. The territorial waters issue remains the central issue in the rivalry which has not been resolved, however. Note: In many ways, this is one of the most minor rivalries in this set of rivalries. The US and Ecuador never had a fundamental dispute that prevented cooperation on other issues. The issue of territorial waters seemed settled repeatedly, but then a new Ecuadorian administration changed policy. While there is a consistent issue, it is a relatively minor one.

This was in part due to the US claim of jurisdiction over all resources on its continental shelf in 1945, which for the first time challenged the freedom of the seas doctrine in place during the period. 

On February 1, 1946, US returned to Ecuador a military base it used in the Latin American country. On August 31, 1949, the President of Ecuador, Galo Plaza Lasso expressed gratitude towards the United States for the help it provided his country following a devastating earthquake in early August.

All of the MIDs from August 1952 to 1981 (MID1702 MID1705 MID3242 MID1803 MID1805 MID1158 MID602 MID3105) were due to Ecuadorean seizures of US fishing boats which, according to Ecuador, were encroaching upon its exclusive economic zone as stated by the Santiago Declaration of 1952 and the 1958 Law of the Sea Treaty.

19821210-19851011 Transition

The last MID of RIV33, MID3105, ended on January 20, 1981. The UN Law of the Sea Convention was signed on December 10, 1982. However, Ecuador, has not signed the convention, while US signed it but did not ratify it as of 20069999. The signing of the UN Law of the Sea Convention by other UN members did play a role regarding the relations between the countries. On March 15, 1983, the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry, referring to Ronald Reagan's unilateral position on US rights over the natural resources in 200 miles of its coastal waters and seabed, has said that the US President's announcement claiming territorial sovereignty over a 200-mile area recognized the rightness of the claims of the countries that were members of the Permanent System of the South Pacific (Spanish: Sistema Permanente del Pacifico Sur). The Foreign Ministry said that President Reagan's announcement was a reaffirmation of the rights specified in the UN convention on the law of the sea after a 15-year struggle by developing coastal countries to defend their marine resources. Ecuador had firmly maintained this position for 40 years. During the early 1980s, Ecuadorian president Febres Cordero closely aligned his foreign and economic policies with that of President Ronald Reagan's, especially those policies regarding US interests in Central America and international debt by Latin American countries as highlighted in the Baker Plan. Restrictions over imports into the US from Ecuador of tuna products, placed as a result of the MIDs, were lifted in 1983.

Although the fishing issue is unresolved, it has not seemingly been a barrier to normal US-Ecuadorian relations, leading to the suspicion that the rivalry is over or not likely to take on any major significance in the two countries' relations as it did in 1971.The principle issues of disagreement between the United States and Ecuador are fishing rights and te disposition of appropriate boundaries regarding territorial waters (see rivalry narrative above). As of June 2006, and despite both countries expressing a willingness to explore possible solutions, the territorial waters issue has yet to be resolved. However, the two countries have not experienced a MID over the issue since 1981 and enjoy a high degree of economic interdependence. 

The United States is Ecuador's primary trading partner, with 38% of Ecuador's exports heading to the US. Total trade has been increasing steadily between the two countries, with trade rising from 2.2 billion in 2001 to 3.5 billion in 2006. Ecuador enjoyed free entry into US markets for many goods via the Andean Trade Preferences Act signed in 1991 (expiring in December of 2001). In 2002 the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) went into affect (set to expire in 2006) giving Ecuador further preferential access to US markets. The United States and Ecuador are currently (along with Colombia and Peru) in negotiations over the proposed Andean Free Trade Agreement. The United States also gives direct aid to Ecuador through the Agency for International Development (USAID). 

In 1999 the two countries signed a joint military agreement giving the United States access to airbases in Ecuador for the purpose of detecting drug trafficking operations.

There have been recent events acting to elevate tensions between the two countries. On June 30, 2001, US Coast Guard officials seized a fishing vessel in Ecuadorian territorial waters. The boat was taken back to Manta, Ecuador to be searched for illegal narcotics. During the course of the inspection for illegal narcotics, the ships cargo was destroyed and the ship was heavily damaged. This same ship was seized and searched on March 3 and 4 of 2002. The owner of the vessel has filed a complaint against the US Coast Guard seeking restitution for the damages. Ecuador's government argues that the seizures are in clear violation of the bilateral treaty signed in 1999. The treaty allows the US government to use airbases in Manta as forward operating locations (FOL). Ecuador permits the US to fly reconnaissance flights for the purpose of identifying illegal narcotics trafficking; however, the treaty explicitly forbids the US from interdicting vessels in Ecuadorian air space or territorial waters. Ecuador suggests that violations of this treaty and a push by the US to renegotiate the treaty to allow for these interdictions have increased tensions between the two countries.

The incidents described above are independent of the MIDs over fishing rights and control of territorial waters experienced in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The absence of current conflict suggests that the rivalry has come to an end; however, the unresolved nature of the issues driving the previous rivalry leaves open the possibility of future disputes. In addition, tensions regarding the extent to which the US is violating the bilateral treaty signed in 1999 and pressure from the US to relax the restrictions in that treaty continue to characterize the relationship. Consequently, while below the level of rivalry, this dyad has yet to reach a relationship characterized by positive peace.

All of the MIDs from August 1952 to 1981 (MID1702 MID1705 MID3242 MID1803 MID1805 MID1158 MID602 MID3105) were due to Ecuadorean seizures of US fishing boats which, according to Ecuador, were encroaching upon its exclusive economic zone as stated by the Santiago Declaration of 1952 and the 1958 Law of the Sea Treaty. The United States did not recognize these claims and only recognized a 12 mile limit for Ecuador, disagreeing with Ecuador over the limits of its territorial waters and fishing rights. While both the US and Ecuador accept an unconditional 12 mile territorial limit, the US does not accept Ecuador's claims about 200 mile control, and has continued to encourage fishing by US fishing fleets inside the 200 mile zone. The seizures by Ecuador had been done in cycles depending on whether the government in power was friendly or not to US interests, and so Ecuador's policy regarding enforcement of the limit has varied by administration. The various rounds of the seizures have earned the name of the *Tuna Wars* between Ecuador and the US.

The rivalry reached its most intense point during the Velasco administration in 1971 when Velasco in an effort to restore some of his popularity domestically seized and fined around 100 US fishing boats within the 200 mile zone, collecting more than $6 million in US dollars. As a result, The United States withdrew practically all of its military and economic aid while Ecuador dismissed all US military advisers.

The last MID that ended on January 20, 1981 led to a US embargo of Ecuadorian tuna.
