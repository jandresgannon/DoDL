MARITMID-NOTES: MID2176 from cm350640v11.0 narrative, this is a maritime MID between Greece and Turkey, who were disputing a section of the Aegean Sea. From NYT 3/6/1983, a NATO military exercise was scheduled to take place in the Aegean, and Greece refused to take part in the exercises. Turkey had demanded that Greece demilitarize an island in the Aegean, Limnos Island, and the NATO exercise was not scheduled to include defense of the island, which Greece interpreted as the US and NATO supporting Turkey's demand for demilitarization of that island. Turkey renewed its demand of the demilitarization of Limnos, triggering this MID, and the US is pulled in against Greece here because of Greece's protest against the NATO exercise in which the US was participating. Coded not maritime because while the US is linked to the maritime MID between Greece and Turkey here, the maritime dispute is not between US and Greece.
