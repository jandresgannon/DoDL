NARRATIVE-CR:
Conflict between Germany and Brazil began in 1917 with their first militarized dispute involving the German sinking of Brazilian ships during World War I (MID400 on 4/5/1917). Further disputes occured during World War II (MID258 on 3/25/1939, MID1787 on 1/18/1942 and MID3503 on 8/22/1942). 

The rivalry hardly appears to be a unique German-Brazil rivalry and more a part of a growing anti-German coalition during the war period. The disputes that take place involve either shipping incidents, the severing of diplomatic relations or the actual declaration of war by Brazil on Germany on August 22, 1942. All conflict is concluded with the defeat of Germany and its unconditional surrender on May 8, 1945.
