This dispute is comprised of a series of incidents generated by United States led efforts to restore the rule of Haitian President Aristide after he was deposed in a coup. The incidents begin with a naval blockade in October of 1993 where the United States was joined by a number of other nations (Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Haiti, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). As the blockade wore on, and the military junta led by General Cedras remained in place, the United States resorted to a number of threats of military action and displays of force. The dispute was resolved with the return of Aristide only after the intercession of US Special Envoy Jimmy Carter. An invasion force was in the air as the deal was brokered. First day of dispute was on 5/29/1994 and last day of dispute was on 9/29/1994.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Haiti and the Dominican Republic disputed their border since Haiti ended its occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1844. The countries signed a peace treaty in Port-au-Prince on November 9, 1874, which provided for the demarcation of their border. Haiti and the Dominican Republic signed an arbitration agreement in Santo Domingo on July 3, 1895, which provided for the submission of the border dispute to the Vatican for arbitration. The Vatican declined the request for arbitration since the parties asked for arbitration "restricted to the simple interpretation of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1874." The countries agreed to establish a mixed demarcation commission on May 28, 1899. Haiti and the Dominican Republic disputed the sovereignty of the Massacre river from February 15 to June 17, 1901, when the countries signed a convention settling the dispute. Haitian and Dominican troops clashed near Puerto Plata on December 27, 1910. The United States secretary-of-state offered to facilitate negotiations between Haiti and the Dominican Republic on January 21, 1911, and the Dominican government accepted the offer on January 31, 1911. Haiti and the Dominican Republic withdrew their troops from the border region on February 1, 1911. Haitian and Dominican representatives held negotiations on a arbitration convention in Washington DC from April 27-August 30, 1911 and April 27-July 13, 1912. Haiti and the Dominican Republic signed a border agreement in Santa Domingo on January 21, 1929, which specified the border between the countries. The mixed commission suspended demarcation on October 28, 1930, when the commission was unable to resolved five points of disagreement concerning the border. The countries resolved the remaining points of disagreement on February 27, 1935, when President Stenio Vincent of Haiti and President Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic signed an agreement to resume the work of the mixed border commission. Haiti and the Dominican Republic signed a protocol in Port-au-Prince on March 9, 1936, which revised the 1929 border agreement. Some 15,000 Haitian laborers who had crossed the border in search of work were killed by Dominican troops beginning on October 4, 1937. Haiti and the Dominican Republic signed an agreement on October 15, 1937, which provided for the peaceful resolution of the dispute. President Vincent of Haiti requested the good offices of Cuba, Mexico, and the US on November 12, 1937, and the countries accepted the request on November 17, 1937. The three countries unsuccessfully attempted to facilitate negotiations from December 3-11, 1937, when the Dominican Republic rejected the suggestion of a commission of inquiry. Haiti referred the matter to the *Pan American Union* (PAU)-the secretariat of the *Union of American Republics* (UAR)-on December 14, 1937. The PAU established a conciliation commission (Argentina, Guatemala, Peru) on December 15, 1937. The PAU conciliation commission decided on January 31, 1938 that the Dominican Republic should pay Haiti an indemnity of $750,000 for the deaths of Haitians by Dominican soldiers. Haiti and the Dominican Republic also signed a border agreement on January 31, 1938. Haiti accused the Dominican Republic of supporting subversive activities by Haitian exiles from Dominican territory, and Haiti referred the matter to the *Organization of American States* (OAS) Permanent Council on February 16, 1949. The OAS Permanent Council appealed for peaceful negotiations on February 26, 1949. Haiti referred the matter to the *Inter-American Peace Committee* (IAPC) on March 24, 1949. The IAPC established a conciliation commission (Argentina, Mexico, US) on May 28, 1949. The IAPC conciliation commission mediated the signing of a joint declaration on June 9, 1949, which called for the peaceful resolution of the dispute. Haiti accused the Dominican Republic of continuing to support subversion by Haitian exiles. Haiti referred the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on January 3, 1950. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, US) chaired by the representative from Uruguay on January 6, 1950. The OAS commission of inquiry issued a report on March 13, 1950, which indicated that the Dominican Republic had been supporting Haitian exiles. The OAS Permanent Council established the *OAS Special Committee for the Caribbean* (SCC) on April 8, 1950. The OAS SCC consisted of five members from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay and the US. The OAS SCC was disbanded in May 1951. Haiti severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on September 9, 1960. On April 26-27, 1963, Haitian police entered and searched the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince where several opponents of the Haiti government had taken refuge. The Dominican Republic severed diplomatic relations with Haiti, and referred the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on April 28, 1963. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry (Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador) headed by Alberto Zuleta Angel of Colombia on April 28, 1963. Haitian troops surrounded the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince on May 2, 1963, and Dominican troops were deployed near the border on May 5-6, 1963. On May 8, 1963, the OAS Permanent Council authorized the commission of inquiry to "offer the parties their services for the purpose of finding a prompt solution to the [dispute] and to ward off the threats to the peace and security of the area." Haiti referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council, and the UN Security discussed the matter on May 8-9, 1963. The US imposed diplomatic sanctions (suspension of diplomatic relations) against Haiti on May 17, 1963. The OAS committee of inquiry issued a report on June 10, 1963, which indicated that there had been an illegal entry of the chancery of the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince by two Haitian policemen. Haiti accused the Dominican Republic of supporting an exile invasion of Haiti, and referred the matter to the OAS on August 5, 1963. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry on August 6, 1963. The OAS commission of inquiry reported that, while there had been an invasion from Dominican territory, there was no evidence of Dominican government support of the invasion. Haitian troops and Dominican troops clashed near the border on August 17 and September 1, 1964. Haiti referred the matter of Dominican aggression to the *United Nations* (UN) Security Council on August 30, 1963, but Haiti withdrew the referral on September 4, 1963. Haiti and the Dominican Republic restored diplomatic relations following the presidential election in the Dominican Republic on June 3, 1966. The Dominican Republic closed the border with Haiti on November 29, 1987 as a result of civil and political violence in Haiti. The Dominican Republic re-opened the border on December 4, 1987. Dominican police and soldiers arrested and deported some 3,000 illegal Haitian immigrants from the country in December 1987. Dominican troops killed six Haitians attempting to cross the border to the Dominican Republic on June 18, 2000.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the Dominican Republic and Haiti occurs from 1986 to 1994 and involves the problem of migration across their common border and Haitian refugees due to constant civil strife in Haiti. Disputes prior to this period involve issues unrelated to the current rivalry. MID1120 MID1207 at the beginning of the 20th century involved the demarcation of their common border and ended with an agreement in 1936. In 1949, the two countries were in dispute over Dominican Republic intervention in Haitian affairs MID2041 and MID1112 from February 1949 to January 1950. In 1963, Haiti illegally entered the Dominican Republic's embassy to capture two Haitian political opponents MID1002. 

On February 1, 1986 the DR closed and fortified its borders with Haiti due to chaos and a possible refugee problem when President Duvalier of Haiti went into exile (MID2354). Amidst civil violence in Haiti, the Dominican Republic closed and fortified its border with Haiti on November 29, 1986 (MID2736). In 1991, tension between the countries increased due to the Dominican Republic's deportation of Haitians from its territory. Haiti accused the DR of trying to foment dissent in Haiti and protested against the deportations. On October 13, 1991 Haiti's UN ambassador accused the Dominican Republic of helping arms reach the Haitian military that ousted President Aristide in a coup in September 1991. The military regime in Haiti recalled its ambassador on November 1, 1991. In May1994, the DR had amassed half of its army along the border in order to enforce a UN embargo of Haiti along with preventing Haitian refugees from crossing into the country (MID4016). On November 29, 1994 the Dominican Republic closed its border with Haiti. 

While the border has been relatively quiet between the two countries, there is no reason to assume the rivalry is concluded. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have resumed normal diplomatic relations. In April 2002, the countries even signed a accord for a free trade zone on the border. Nonetheless, since Haitian stability is far from secure, the rivalry does have the possibility of flaring up again, forcing the Dominican Republic to fortify and/or close its borders. Additionally, the Dominican Republic has not been particularly cooperative with the Aristide regime with regard to exiles and refugees. In May 2003, the Dominican army released five Haitians the Aristide regime accused of plotting to overthrow his government. On May 22, 2003 President Mejia of the Dominican Republic refused to extradite this group of Haitian exiles at the request of the Haitian government.

Haiti and the Dominican Republic signed an agreement on October 15, 1937, which provided for the peaceful resolution of the dispute. President Vincent of Haiti requested the good offices of Cuba, Mexico, and the US on November 12, 1937, and the countries accepted the request on November 17, 1937. The three countries unsuccessfully attempted to facilitate negotiations from December 3-11, 1937, when the Dominican Republic rejected the suggestion of a commission of inquiry. Haiti referred the matter to the *Pan American Union* (PAU)-the secretariat of the *Union of American Republics* (UAR)-on December 14, 1937. The PAU established a conciliation commission (Argentina, Guatemala, Peru) on December 15, 1937. On January 31, 1938, the Dominican Republic agreed to pay $750,000 to Haiti for the slaying of Haitians that occurred in the Dominican Republic. The PAU conciliation commission decided on January 31, 1938 that the Dominican Republic should pay Haiti an indemnity of $750,000 for the deaths of Haitians by Dominican soldiers. Haiti and the Dominican Republic also signed a border agreement on January 31, 1938. From 1942 to 1946 anti-Haitismo was part of the official policy of the Dominican Republic, against a Haitian president, Elie Lescot, Trujillo was not able to control anymore. Underlying conflict issues like the demarcation of the border, the territorial waters as well as the memories of the 1937 massacre of Haitians, were still present. From February 16, 1949 to May 1951 Haiti and Dominican Republic had disputes (MID2041, MID1112) over the alleged support the Dominican Republic gave to Haitian exiles to conduct subversive activities against the Haitian government. On December 1949, the Dominican Ambassador to Port-au-Prince reveals to the Haitian President the existence of a complot financed by the Dominican President Trujillo to assassinate high ranking officials of the Haitian government and the President, too, and to destabilize the country. The OAS set up a commission of inquiry to look into this matter. It found out that the Dominican Republic was responsible for supporting subversive activities. The OAS Special Committee for the Caribbean was disbanded in May 1951.
In 1951 the two countries set up a Mixed Haitian-Dominican Commission to settle the disputed issue of the use of territorial waters. This Commission worked until 1956. In 1952, an agreement was signed by both countries to regulate the number of Haitian workers working for the Dominican sugar industry. These agreements were renewed until 1986. From 1957 to 1961, the two dictators, Francois Duvalier and Rafael Trujillo understood that it was mutually convenient to protect each other, rather than to fight against each other. They had a common goal-survival-and a common enemy, Fidel Castro's revolutionary Cuba. However, anti-Haitismo was still high among the Dominican masses. Haiti severed diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic on September 9, 1960.

On April 26-27, 1963, Haitian police entered and searched the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince where several opponents of the Haiti government had taken refuge. The Dominican Republic severed diplomatic relations with Haiti, and referred the matter to the OAS Permanent Council on April 28, 1963. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry (Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador) headed by Alberto Zuleta Angel of Colombia on April 28, 1963. Haitian troops surrounded the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince on May 2, 1963, and Dominican troops were deployed near the border on May 5-6, 1963. On May 8, 1963, the OAS Permanent Council authorized the commission of inquiry to offer the parties their services for the purpose of finding a prompt solution to the dispute and to ward off the threats to the peace and security of the area. Haiti referred the matter to the *United Nations *(UN) Security Council, and the UN Security discussed the matter on May 8-9, 1963. The US imposed diplomatic sanctions (suspension of diplomatic relations) against Haiti on May 17, 1963. The OAS committee of inquiry issued a report on June 10, 1963, which indicated that there had been an illegal entry of the chancery of the Dominican embassy in Port-au-Prince by two Haitian policemen. Haiti accused the Dominican Republic of supporting an exile invasion of Haiti, and referred the matter to the OAS on August 5, 1963. The OAS Permanent Council established a five-member commission of inquiry on August 6, 1963. The OAS commission of inquiry reported that, while there had been an invasion from Dominican territory, there was no evidence of Dominican government support of the invasion. Haitian troops and Dominican troops clashed near the border on August 17 and September 1, 1964. Haiti referred the matter of Dominican aggression to the *United Nations* (UN) Security Council on August 30, 1963, but Haiti withdrew the referral on September 4, 1963. Haiti and the Dominican Republic restored diplomatic relations following the presidential election in the Dominican Republic on June 3, 1966.

The election of Joaquin Balaguer in 1966, and his twelve-year tenure in power ushered in a new era in Haitian-Dominican relations. The 1960s and 1970s were years of cordial relations between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in spite of the anti-Haitian views of Balaguer. During this period, a new generation of progressive Dominican scholars questioned, criticized, and shattered the racist claims of antihaitianismo. These intellectuals denounced antihaitianismo as being an ideological weapon of the Dominican dominant class. However, the fact remained that antihaitianismo was still the dominant popular ideology. On February 1, 1986 the DR closed and fortified its borders with Haiti due to chaos and a possible refugee problem when President Duvalier of Haiti went into exile. The first MID of the RIV160, MID2354, started on February 1, 1986.

19940929-19960321 Transition

The last MID of RIV160, MID4016 ended on September29th, 1994. On September 29th,1994 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 944, directing that all sanctions imposed by the Council under preceding resolutions be terminated on the day following President Aristide's return to Haiti. The same day the embargo on Haitian ports and airports was lifted. This is a period of transition from the end of the rivalry to a more cooperative relationship between the two countries. The major issues of contention regarding the Haitian immigrants are still present, however the countries are on a path towards re-establishing bilateral relations. With the establishment of Mr.Aristide as President of Haiti in 1994, the spill-over of the political turmoil in Haiti ceased to be an issue of contention.

On March 22nd, 1996, the first visit at the presidential level between Haiti and the Dominican Republic took place. The two countries decided to establish a commission to deal with the many disputes they face. Among the issues of dispute are: immigrants, trade and anti-Aristide officers and paramilitaries who sought refugee in the Dominican Republic after 1994. Throughout the 1990s various negotiations and joint commissions were established by the two countries to regulate the Haitian immigrants working on the Dominican sugar cane plantations. Trade between the two countries increased so that Haiti is the third country of export for Dominican products in the Americas. In August 1996 the Dominican police arrested two of the Haitian ex-leaders who were sought by the Haitian officials. This was an important issue in the Haitian-Dominican dispute. However, despite the warming relations between the two countries, Dominican troops killed six Haitians attempting to cross the border to the Dominican Republic on June 18, 2000. Every year there are incidents at the border with Haitians who want to immigrate. Despite the warming relations deep issues of dispute remain like Haitian immigration and the about one million Haitian immigrants in the Dominican Republic, the political instability in Haiti, deep cultural and racial prejudices as well as a history of disputes and hatred. Lately, the border has been relatively quiet between the two countries. Haiti and the Dominican Republic have resumed normal diplomatic relations. In April 2002, the countries even signed a accord for a free trade zone on the border. Nonetheless, since Haitian stability is far from secure, the dispute does have the possibility of flaring up again, forcing the Dominican Republic to fortify and/or close its borders. Additionally, the Dominican Republic has not been particularly cooperative with the Aristide regime with regard to exiles and refugees. In May 2003, the Dominican army released five Haitians the Aristide regime accused of plotting to overthrow his government. On May 22, 2003 President Mejia of the Dominican Republic refused to extradite this group of Haitian exiles at the request of the Haitian government. Bilateral relations have improved, following the visit to the Dominican Republic of the newly elected Haitian President, Rene Preval, in March 2006, but continued illegal immigration from Haiti stemming from the country's entrenched socio-economic difficulties will keep underlying tensions high.
