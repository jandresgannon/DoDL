CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID361 from Gibler (2018), gunmen in Somalia hijacked a bus full of French students, and when France deployed troops, small clashes with Somalian troops occurred. From Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2/4/1976, the gunmen were part of a militarized rebel group who were demanding independence from France, as Djibouti was a French colony at the time. Coded civil war MID because a militarized rebel group in Somalia caused this MID between France and Somalia.
