RIVNOTES: 
RIV10005 is the result of a combination of three rivalries, MID1532, MID1681 MID1531 MID1530 MID1599 MID1529, and MID2234 MID100 did not originally meet the time density criteria (although just barely). The disputes generally involve the same issues and the same pattern of US intervention to promote stability in Haiti.

MID1002

TERRMID: MID1002 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1002 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1002 from cm narrative, Haitian president Duvalier sent troops into a Dominican chancery in pursuit of his former lieutenant, who had fled into the Dominican Republic. The DR responded by placing the armed forces on alert. In response to this tension, the US, Canada, and Britain sent naval forces to the Gulf of Gonave to prepare to intervene.

CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1002 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1002 is a multilateral MID, as British and Canadian naval forces deployed to prepare for intervention, and DR forces were placed on alert in response to the Haitians crossing the border. However, the other MIDs are all Haiti-other country, so this is not coded as a LINK variable because it did not cause any third parties to have a dispute with each other.

DISPLAY OF FORCE 

This dispute is comprised of a series of incidents generated by United States led efforts to restore the rule of Haitian President Aristide after he was deposed in a coup. The incidents begin with a naval blockade in October of 1993 where the United States was joined by a number of other nations (Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Haiti, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). As the blockade wore on, and the military junta led by General Cedras remained in place, the United States resorted to a number of threats of military action and displays of force. The dispute was resolved with the return of Aristide only after the intercession of US Special Envoy Jimmy Carter. An invasion force was in the air as the deal was brokered. First day of dispute was on 10/18/1993 and last day of dispute was on 9/29/1994.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The rivalry between the US and Haiti is largely the result of US attempts to maintain order and stability in the region under the auspices of the Monroe Doctrine and is one that continues throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Since its recognition of Haiti in 1862, the US consistently attempted to expand its influence in Haiti, sending its navy into the deepwater port of Mole St. Nichoas as early as 1869 to secure this strategic area from potential hostile foreign powers, MID1532. Indeed, US interventions, MID1681, MID1531, MID1530, MID1599, and MID1529 characterize the rivalry with mostly naval and marine deployments to protect Haiti from foreign powers such as Germany, France and the UK who occasionally showed intentions of intervening in Haiti, most often to secure repayment of loans given to the Haitian government. Two MIDs between the two countries at the beginning of the 20th century also continued to characterize this pattern, MID2234 and MID100.

In December of 1914, the US sent in marines to enter the national bank, MID100, taking $500,000 in gold to New York for security reasons since the government of Haiti remained consistently unstable throughout the beginning of the 20th century, with seven presidents holding office between 1908 and 1915 during which approximately 20 uprisings and attempted coups occurred. The US invasion of Haiti in July 1915 represented the most severe conflict between the two countries; a conflict that resulted in the US occupation of the country until 1934. During this occupation, the United States disarmed the capital, Port-au-Prince, arrested suspected Caco revolutionaries (those who fought against the occupation) and installed essentially a puppet government cooperative to US interests. Also during this period, the US seized control of Haiti's customs houses and drafted a new constitution, adopted in 1918. The occupation ended largely due to increased international condemnation sparked in part because of a massacre by the US marines on the southern coast of Haiti in December, 1929 when 1,500 Haitians were killed after being fired upon because of their demonstrations against the occupation. 

In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a commission led by W. Cameron Forbes to investigate the condition of the Haitian occupation. The Forbes Commission recommended the withdrawal of US troops from Haiti later that year. In November of 1930, Stenio Vincent was elected the new president and the process of negotiating a withdrawal began. On August 15, 1934 the US officially left the country. 

After the withdrawal, the new Vincent regime managed to maintain a semblance of the order imposed on Haiti by the US occupation. Although the threat of renewed US intervention was constant, arguably the Great Depression and increasing war clouds in Europe forced the US to limit its concerns about the country's affairs. In the mid 1930s, Vincent managed to transform the government from one that was marginally representative to a dictatorship, thus beginning a new period of instability. Upon his unconstitutional *election* to a third term, the United States refused to sanction his presidency, forcing Vincent to step down and allow the election of Elie Lescot, Haitian ambassador to the US, as the next president. Relations between the two countries improved as Lescot made several efforts to draw Haiti closer to the US. In 1944, Haiti declared war on Japan the day after the US in a show of support. The US responded by promising to purchase more cotton from Haiti and providing weapons and tanks under the Lend Lease program. In addition, Lescot allowed the US Coast guard to station itself at Bizoton outside of Port-au-Prince while offering Mole St. Nicolas as a base for the navy. Also in 1944, Lescot allowed Reynolds Aluminum to mine bauxite in the island. Like Vincent before him, however, Lescot also began to assume a dictatorial leadership for the next four years that found itself the subject of a coup in January of 1946, when a military junta took control for seven months and subsequently established a new set of elections bringing Dumarsais Estime to the presidency until May of 1950. 

Estime, again like his predecessors took a dictatorial posture that could not withstand a severely damaged economy. His harsh rule led to regular intervals of assassination and coup attempts. This instability was furthered by Estime's repraisals that consisted of invoking martial law, banning newspapers and attacking outspoken critics. In May of 1950, the same military junta that helped him to get elected, removed him from office. 

In December of 1950, Paul Magloire, one of the junta leaders, took the office of president after being directly elected from the people. Magloire was able to further strengthen the ties to Washington, visting the United States and getting Richard Nixon, then vice-president, to visit Haiti in return. Soon after the visit, the US and UN contributed to the construction of a dam on the Artibonite River. He too followed down the dictatorial path, however, enjoying economic success early in his reign when coffee prices rose along with the tourist, rice and cotton industries. This economic success, however, did not follow an equitible distribution. After being criticized of stealing much of the state's revenue, along with a series of scandals concerning the misappropriation of hurricane relief funds due to the devastation of Hurricane Hazel in October 1954, Magliore's regime was quickly discredited. After a series of strikes, invoking martial law and the dissolution of the legislature in December 1956, Magloire was forced to resign, going into exile in the United States and leaving Joseph Nemours Pierre-Louis as provisional president until February 3, 1957. On that day a general strike the day before caused the city of Port-au-Prince to effectively shut down. 

Haiti remained essentially leaderless with interim presidents until September when Francois Duvalier was elected. Duvalier was pro-American in his foreign policy which helped to secure US aid, largely in part to the US fear of Castro's ability to spread revolution from nearby Cuba. After Duvalier's reign of terror in Haiti, the US under the Kennedy administration decided to end most of its military and technical aid to the country in 1962. *Papa Doc's* extensive corruption and brutality brought the US back into Haiti on April 26, 1963, MID1002, when Haitian troops entered a Dominican chancery in search of former Lieutenant Francois Benoit who President Duvalier suspected of murdering the driver and two bodyguards of his children's limousine. These murders came after a series of terror attacks by Duvalier to eliminate any rivals from elections that were to be held in February. These elections never occurred. 

On the 28th of April, the Dominican Armed Forces went on alert as Juan Bosch demanded that the Haitians leave the chancery and withdraw its troops that had it surrounded. US ships entered the Gulf of Gonave in preparation for intervention, along with British and Canadian naval forces. On May 15, 1963 Duvalier declared the beginning of an unconstitutional second term, ending or at least limiting his terror attacks and ending any justifications for foreign intervention. On June 3, 1963, US ships left the Gulf of Gonave. Duvalier died April 14, 1971 leaving a hereditary presidency for his son Jean-Claude. 

With the Carter administration's focus on human rights, the relations between the two countries were strained once again as the Haitian president did not conform to US standards. During the 1980s, the Haitian economy took a turn for the worse, with the AIDS epidemic wiping out tourism, agricultural output declining by 1.3 percent per year and the external debt rising from $320 million in 1980 to $690 million in 1985. Further distancing from the US occurred when the Haitian government began to expand the state into the manufacturing industry, allowing the ruling family and friends to undermine competition in order to gain monopolies. The US Agency for International Development disagreed with this policy. In January of 1986, the United States threatened the end of American aid if Haiti did not pursue democratic processes and respect human rights as according to the Mica Amendment to the US Foreign Assistance bill. Without US aid, the Duvalier regime was quickly threatened and in 1986, the Duvaliers went into exile in France with US transport. 

Duvalier's departure brought on a series of coups beginning in 1986 and going on through 1990 until Jean Aristide was elected into office in December. Although very popular with the masses, Aristide immediately faced coup attempts, succumbing to one in September 1991. The US and Organization of American States quickly supported Aristide's regime because he was democratically elected and began an embargo of all non-humanitarian commercial traffic to Haiti, enforced by the US navy. The Bush administration's position on Haiti followed a recipe of aggressive mediation along with forced repatriation of Haitians illegally in the US as a result of fleeing Haiti after the coup. 

Upon Clinton's election in 1992, a resurgence of Haitian migrants to the US occurred, forcing the US to add more pressure on Haiti to resolve the crisis. On July 3, 1993, the UN managed to broker the Governors Island Accord between Aristide and the coup leader General Cedras that was intended on restoring democracy to Haiti with Cedras' stepping down from power on October 30. The Accord provided for a multinational UN mission to support the transition and two weeks after it was signed, US military personnel arrived to begin the operation. As the USS *Harlan County* prepared to entered into port it was greeted by armed Cedras supporters that were against any US and UN interventions. Due to the recent events in Somalia and the deaths of 19 US soldiers there, the US withdrew the *Harlan County* as it was only minimally armed. After this incident the US Congress began a series of hearings on US courses of action in Haiti. On June 16, 1994, the US withdrew its staff at the embassy in Port-au-Prince. On June 25, the US announced that it would increase its sanctions by ending all commercial and financial transactions between the two countries, causing the provisional president Emile Jonassaint to declare a state of emergency. Haitian refugees to the US increased after these actions, further increasing the tensions between the two countries. Through August 1994, the US began to prepare for an invasion of Haiti, claiming to have exhausted all other diplomatic avenues, with the UN Security Council passing a resolution allowing the US to carry out a military intervention in Haiti on behalf of the UN on July 31. 

On September 19, 1994 US troops arrived in Haiti bringing back the exiled Aristide regime to power, MID4016. In December 1995, new presidential elections were held and Rene Preval was elected. During Preval's administration, the Haitian population became increasingly discontent with familiar accusations of corruption and exploitation. In 2000, Aristide was elected to the presidency again, in a questionably legitimate fashion according to members of the US Congress who claimed that Preval's government organized the election in such a way as to ensure handing over the government to Aristide. 

Given the nature of US intervention in Haiti since the 19th century, it seems that while there have been many years of peace in between interventions, the 20th century disputes are certainly very much related to the same issue, stability. With this in mind, it seems worthwhile to consider this rivalry one that may be far from over. At the present, there does appear to be some stability in Haiti although democracy is not as certain. Thus it seems that the US-Haiti rivalry could reemerge if the Aristide government takes the path that most of Haiti's leaders have taken toward dictatorship and terror attacks against the population, particularly since the terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001 have made the US more attentive to unstable regimes that might potentially foster terrorists.

SB-CR:
US / Haiti Years: 1869-1915. Issues at stake: US regional influence; rights to a US naval base in Haiti; US influence over Haitian government policy; US desire for stable pro-US government. End Coding: In 1915 the US occupies Haiti, imposing a settlement of the rivalry. Number of militarized disputes: 7. Number of 30 day reciprocated militarized disputes: 1. Last militarized dispute: 1915. Wars: none. Summary: Throughout the 1843-1915 period, as well as in recent decades, Haiti has been unstable, subject to violence, and vulnerable to outside pressure. The US sought to influence Haitian government policy during the frequent periods of political instability in Haiti, with the US desiring a stable pro-US government in power. Several specific issues were raised during the course of the rivalry, generally as a result of the US desire to maintain and extend its influence in Haiti and the Caribbean. One specific issue was the US desire for a naval base in Haiti, a request never granted by any Haitian leader. Disputes through the period are mostly US threats and uses of forces accompanied by *no response* by Haiti. In a few instances Haiti used military force against the US, as for example in 1888 when Haitian military personnel boarded a US ocean liner, discovered two Haitian rebels hidden on board, and arrested the liner's crew. 1891 was the last militarized dispute between the two states until the US occupation of Haiti in 1915. However, relations did not improve between the two during that interval, despite minor treaties signed in 1902 and 1909. Rather, the lack of militarized disputes more reflected simply the US choosing not to take action during that period. Unrest in Haiti continued through the period with only short (3-5 year) periods of relative stability. In 1893 there were explicit discussions among the Haitian elite suggesting that they feared that the US might invade or take other actions against Haiti, and the US continued to put pressure on Haiti and make statements about Haitian politics. The US occupation of Haiti was prompted by the immediate concerns of severe civil unrest in Haiti and fears of European involvement in Haiti, which was viewed as a clear threat to US regional hegemony. Haiti had a significant debt to certain European states, particularly Germany, and the US was afraid that these lenders would take WWI as an excuse to occupy or intervene in Haiti. The US occupation seems to have had a large element of preventive war. Notes: This rivalry is unique in a two ways. First, it isn't really a *reciprocated* rivalry in that the US took advantage of its power differential to try to influence Haiti when it wanted to, this was the source of disputes more often than in most rivalries. Second, the termination of the rivalry took place under quite different circumstances from most rivalries as well. Very few rivalries end with a truly imposed solution; even states forced to agreements have opportunities to voice their rejection of terms. In Haiti, because the US occupation was so long (to 1934) and extensive, this was not the case. In effect the US settled issues of Haitian unrest and a pro-US government by creating a new Haiti for this period. Related to this, this case may have the most extreme power differential of the rivalries in the data set. The settlement is somewhat problematic because of this long occupation, in that it is unlikely that elites accepted US occupation willingly, and the imposed settlement did not endure long beyond US departure.

On September 9, 1915, the last MID of RIV10005, MID100 ended. Haitian and US representatives signed an agreement on September 16, 1915, which provided for a 20-year US protectorate over Haiti. The Haitian Senate ratified the protectorate agreement on November 11, 1915. Admiral Caperton dissolved the Haitian Congress on June 19, 1917, and established a military government. A new constitution was approved in a plebiscite on June 18, 1918. Charlemagne Perlate and Benoit Batraville led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Haitian government and US troops from October 17, 1918 to May 19, 1920. Some 2,000 rebels, 28 US soldiers, and 70 Haitian soldiers were killed during the rebellion. Louis Borno was elected president by the Haitian Council of State on April 11, 1922, and President Borno was re-elected by the Haitian Council of State on April 12, 1926. US troops and Haitians clashed in Aux Cayes on December 7, 1929, resulting in the deaths of six individuals. The Haitian government declared martial law. 

In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a commission led by W. Cameron Forbes to investigate the condition of the Haitian occupation. The Forbes Commission recommended the withdrawal of US troops from Haiti later that year. In November of 1930, Stenio Vincent was elected the new president and the process of negotiating a withdrawal began. The American occupation ended largely due to increased international condemnation sparked in part because of the massacre by the US marines on the southern coast of Haiti in December, 1929 when 1,500 Haitians were killed after being fired upon because of their demonstrations against the occupation. US troops completed their withdrawal from Haiti on August 15, 1934. Some 10,000 Haitians were killed by US troops during the protectorate.

After the withdrawal, the new Vincent regime managed to maintain a semblance of the order imposed on Haiti by the US occupation. Although the threat of renewed US intervention was constant, arguably the Great Depression and increasing war clouds in Europe forced the US to limit its concerns about the country's affairs. In the mid 1930s, Vincent managed to transform the government from one that was marginally representative to a dictatorship, thus beginning a new period of instability. Upon his unconstitutional `election' to a third term, the United States refused to sanction his presidency, forcing Vincent to step down and allow the election of Elie Lescot, Haitian ambassador to the US, as the next president. Relations between the two countries improved as Lescot made several efforts to draw Haiti closer to the US. Until 1944, the possibility of U.S. intervention was always present. 

In 1944, Haiti declared war on Japan the same day as the US, December 8, 1944, in a show of support to their American allies. The US responded by promising to purchase more cotton from Haiti and providing weapons and tanks under the Lend Lease program. In addition, Lescot allowed the US Coast guard to station itself at Bizoton outside of Port-au-Prince while offering Mole St. Nicolas as a base for the navy. Also in 1944, Lescot allowed Reynolds Aluminum to mine bauxite in the island. Like Vincent before him, however, Lescot also began to assume a dictatorial leadership for the next four years that found himself the subject of a coup in January of 1946, when a military junta took control for seven months and subsequently established a new set of elections bringing Dumarsais Estime to the presidency until May of 1950. 

Estime, again like his predecessors took a dictatorial posture that could not withstand a severely damaged economy. His harsh rule led to regular intervals of assassination and coup attempts. This instability was furthered by Estime's repraisals that consisted of invoking martial law, banning newspapers and attacking outspoken critics. In May of 1950, the same military junta that helped him to get elected removed him from office. 

In December of 1950, Paul Magloire, one of the junta leaders, took the office of president after being directly elected from the people. Magloire was able to further strengthen the ties to Washington, visiting the United States and getting Richard Nixon, then vice-president, to visit Haiti in return. Soon after the visit, the US and UN contributed to the construction of a dam on the Artibonite River. He too followed down the dictatorial path, however, enjoying economic success early in his reign when coffee prices rose along with the tourist, rice and cotton industries. This economic success, however, did not follow an equitable distribution. After being criticized of stealing much of the state's revenue, along with a series of scandals concerning the misappropriation of hurricane relief funds due to the devastation of Hurricane Hazel in October 1954, Magliore's regime was quickly discredited. After a series of strikes, an invokement of martial law and the dissolvement of the legislature in December 1956, Magloire was forced to resign, going into exile in the United States and leaving Joseph Nemours Pierre-Louis as provisional president until February 3, 1957. On that day a general strike the day before caused the city of Port-au-Prince to effectively shut down. 

Haiti remained essentially leaderless with interim presidents until September 1957 when Francois Duvalier was elected. Duvalier was pro-American in his foreign policy which helped to secure US aid, largely in part to the US fear of Castro's ability to spread revolution from nearby Cuba. However, with the election of John F Kennedy to the presidency, relations with Haiti began to quickly deteriorate. 

19610530-19640115 RIV8-0.25

Events turned sour first in May of 1961 with Haiti's fraudulent elections from April 30, 1961-the elections violated the constitution of 1957 by reelecting Duvalier to another 6 year term of office to begin on May 15, 1963. After the election, the Kennedy administration began using various coercive methods to pressure for change in Haiti, including providing aid to Duvalier's opposition including call back its ambassador from Port-au-Prince. In 1962, the Kennedy administration suspended military and technical aid to Haiti due to Duvalier's reign of terror. MID1002 occurred between US and Haiti from April to June of 1963. In May of 1963, after Duvalier refused to leave office at the end of his original 6 year term of office, the US temporarily suspended diplomatic relations, cut off economic aid, and evacuated all US citizens from Haiti. Normal relations between the two countries ended on May 15, 1963, when the Haitian government asked the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti, Raymond Thurston, to leave the country. The chances of an American intervention in Haiti increased significantly. A new American Ambassador returned to Haiti only on January 16, 1964.

Relations with Haiti improve when the Johnson Administration takes power and a new U.S. Ambassador is sent to Haiti, on January 16, 1964. President Johnson sees value in having Haiti's support in the OAS regarding regional policy. Consequently, the US backs off of criticism of Duvalier's human rights abuses and aligns itself with the regime. By 1966, the US is once again providing aid to Haiti and encouraging private investment and tourism; although, due to the dire human rights conditions in Haiti, US aid during this time was mostly indirect. At this time, Haiti is considered one of the most repressive countries in the region and, especially in the 1970s, huge numbers of refuges begin to pour out of Haiti bound mainly for the US. Because of the influx of Haitians seeking to leave Haiti in the late 1960s and 1970s, the US began to reduce the number of temporary visas issued for Haitians to visit the US; this policy, in turn, increased the number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat in Florida.

The Nixon administration adopted a more open policy of support for the Haitian government. In 1970, Nixon lifted the ban on arms sales to Haiti and a year later authorized the sale of 1 million in arms to Haiti. Nixon also authorized the resumption of economic aid to Haiti. These activities picked up considerably after Duvalier's son, Jean-Claude, ascended to power in 1971. Although the Nixon administration tried to justify resumption of normal relations by arguing that Jean-Claude Duvalier had ended many of the more repressive policies of his father, by the mid-1970s most human rights watch groups argued that conditions had not improved. Relations with Haiti continued in the same manner with the Ford Administration.

The Carter Administration attempted to incorporate protection of human rights into US foreign policy practices. By tying US aid to human rights, Haiti's human rights abuses decreased some but only marginally. The Reagan administration interested more in security concerns than human rights, wished to maintain friendly relations with Haiti as an anti-communist partner in the region. In 1986, Jean-Claude Duvalier was deposed resulting in a period of upheaval. At this time, the US pressured for a move toward a more democratic form of government. In February 1991, Haiti democratically elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency; however, Aristide was quickly deposed, on September 30, 1991. 

19911004-20040228 RIV9-.25

In response to the coup, the US placed sanctions on Haiti on October 4, 1991 and again in June of 1993. In June and July of 1993, the United States assisted in negotiating the Governor's Islands Agreement between ousted Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide and General Cedras, the military leader of Haiti. The agreement called for the resignation of Cedras by October 15, 1993 and the return of Aristide to the presidency. In addition, the agreement called for United Nations backed United States and Canadian trainers to be deployed to Haiti to assist in the transition. On September 23, 1993 the United Nations officially authorized the deployment of trainers to Haiti. The month of September was spent working out the details for the transition of political power. On October 11, 1993, the United States deployed the US Harlan County with the trainer force to Port-au-Prince. The ship, however, never made it to port. Generals inside Cedras' regime arranged for demonstrators to stage a protest at Port-au-Prince harbor in an effort to prevent the ship for deploying the trainers. Two Haitian gun boats deployed within 2500 yards of the US Harlan County on October 12, 1993. That same day, the US recalled the US Harlan County fearing the out break of violence if the trainers were deployed. The failure of the United States to deploy the trainers allowed the Haitian military to claim victory over US forces and weakened Cedras' hold on power, as he was the one who authorized the agreement with the United States in the first place. 

On October 18, 1993, in response to Haiti's apparent failure to abide by the Governor's Island Agreement, sanctions were re-imposed on Haiti and later, on October 29, the United States froze all US based assets of the military regime. After months of failed negotiations, US President William J Clinton declared on May 3, 1994 that the military option was now officially on the table for restoring democracy in Haiti. On May 6, in response to an April 27 appeal, the United Nations authorized tougher sanctions against Haiti. And, on July 3, 1994, the United Nations Security Council authorized the use of force to remove the military leaders from Haiti. 

In a last ditch effort to negotiate a settlement before resorting to force, President Clinton sent former US President Jimmy Carter, Colin Powell, and Sam Nunn to Haiti to speak with Cedras. At the same time that the mission was attempting to persuade the military regime to step down, the US began deploying troops to the region in anticipation of an invasion. On September 18, 1994, under the pressure of an imminent US invasion, the military regime agreed to step down. Three thousand US troops landed on September 20 and, by the end of the week, the number of US troops had reached 15,000. On October 15, 1994 President Jean Bertrand Aristide finally returned to power in Haiti. 

In the late 1990s, Haiti continued to experience instability and poverty. However, due to growing unpopularity in the US for maintaining troops in Haiti and a desire by the US not to be viewed as occupiers, US troops were removed late 1999 to early 2000. Aristide was reelected in 2000 amidst what election observers called significant irregularities. The US government's relations with Haiti deteriorated following Aristide's reelection in 2000 as the Haitian leader excluded opposition leaders from the decision making process and instituted repressive measures against rivals. Because of perceptions of a rigged election, the UN pulled troops prior to Aristide taking office in February of 2001.

In February of 2004, violent civil strife broke out in Haiti. US Secretary of State Colin Powell stated on February 17, 2004 that the US was not interested in sending troops to help the government of Jean-Bertrand Aristide put down the uprising. Powell argued that the US was committed to a diplomatic solution. Early in the crisis, the US suggested that they might support a plan that removed Aristide from office. On February 19th, the US government announced plans to send a military team to Haiti to assess the security of the US embassy and personnel. Again, the US ruled out the option of militarily assisting the Haitian government in quelling the rebellion. On February 20th the US government called for the evacuation of all US citizens from Haiti and, working with France, made ultimately failed attempts at brokering a political solution.

On February 29, 2004 Jean-Bertrand Aristide, under pressure from both France and the US, resigned as president and fled Haiti into exile in the Central African Republic. At the time, there were conflicting reports concerning whether Aristide was forced out of office by the US or whether he voluntarily ceded power. Following Aristide's resignation, roughly 2000 military personnel, 1,500 of which were US Marines, landed in Haiti in order to restore order. The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1529 authorizing the Multinational Interim Force (MIF) and committing to providing a stabilization force aimed at bringing order to Haitian politics and society. Full control of peacekeeping in Haiti was officially handed over to the UN on June 25th, when the US withdrew nearly 2000 troops. As of August 31, 2006 the UN contingent in Haiti stood at just over 8,000 troops and personnel. A United States marine was shot and wounded by snipers during a patrol on March 16, 2004, in a poor neighborhood of this teeming city, becoming the first American military casualty here since the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a military spokesman said. Meanwhile, Mr. Aristide arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, at about 1:45 p.m. after an overnight flight on a chartered jet from the Central African Republic, where he had taken refuge after his departure from Haiti on February 29, 2004. Mr. Aristide's spokesman in Jamaica, Huntley Medley, said Mr. Aristide thanked the Jamaican government and people for allowing him to come for a visit. Mr. Aristide is expected to remain several weeks, and will be reunited with his two young daughters, whom he sent to the United States when Haiti's situation began to deteriorate. Officials in Jamaica have said Mr. Aristide must not use his visit to their country, about 100 miles from Haiti, to foment unrest in Haiti, which is just beginning to stabilize after the month-long uprising that forced Mr. Aristide from power. Haiti's new prime minister, Gerard Latortue, has condemned Mr. Aristide's visit to Jamaica and told reporters in Port-au-Prince that he would suspend diplomatic relations with Jamaica and recall Haiti's ambassador to Kingston. The wounded marine, who was hit in the arm, was among a detachment of soldiers patrolling a neighborhood near the presidential palace on Sunday night, said the military spokesman, Lt. Col. David A. Lapan. The marine, Pfc. Howard W. Hamilton, 20, from Murfreesboro, Tenn., was evacuated to a hospital in Miami, where he was in stable condition, Colonel Lapan said. The soldiers returned fire but did not know if they had inflicted any casualties, the spokesman said. Members of the American military deployment, which with about 1,700 troops is the largest division of a four-nation military task force, have been fired at many times since arriving after Mr. Aristide's flight into exile under pressure from Haitian rebels and the French and American governments. Five Haitian gunmen have died in firefights with the Americans, the American military said. A sixth Haitian was killed when he tried to run a military roadblock in a car, the military said. American officials say that disarming militants from all factions is a cornerstone of their mission in Haiti. Some experts estimate that there are many thousands of illegal weapons, with a majority in Port-au-Prince and other cities. So far, however, American troops have confiscated only four weapons, and they have conducted only one deliberate disarmament mission-a raid on a suspected arms cache-but found nothing. The Chilean troops have confiscated three rifles they found in a shack near their installation on the grounds of a university campus here, said Gonzalo Vega, a spokesman for the Chilean contingent. The French troops have said their mission would not include disarmament, said Maj. Xavier Pons, spokesman for the French contingent. Kiersten Leus, a spokeswoman for Canada's military, said its mission would be fully defined next week when the complete force of about 450 people is to become operational. 
Shooting erupted on December 2, 2004, outside Haiti's presidential palace while U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was inside talking with interim leaders of the violence-plagued country. The gunfire broke out moments after Mr. Powell arrived for meetings with Prime Minister Gerard Latortue and President Boniface Alexandre at the palace in the run-down capital. In response, United Nations guards outside the palace opened fire as well. U.S. officials said it was unclear whether the shooting was connected to Mr. Powell's visit. Speaking to reporters after the incident, Mr. Powell said it is essential that the UN force be built up to full strength and that it actively engage the gunmen who still hold sway in many parts of Haiti.

On April 17, 2005, the Bush administration has been accused of ignoring its own arms embargo and overseeing the sale of $ 7m-worth (3.7m) of weapons to the Haitian government to equip its police force. Human rights groups say the police carry out routine executions of dissidents and weapons are often illegally funneled to armed militia. Robert Muggah of the Swiss-based Small Arms Survey, a non-profit group, said that last year the US effected the sale of thousands of weapons to the interim government headed by Gerard Latortue, despite a 13-year arms embargo. 'They are meant to brace up a shaky security force, but the reality is they could actually undermine security by jeopardizing an innovative disarmament effort just getting under way,' said Mr Muggah, who has spent several months in Haiti interviewing diplomats and UN officials for a report. The embargo was established after a coup that ousted the elected president Jean-Betrand Aristide, who was forced into exile for a second time last year. Washington, which had long under-mined his presidency, refused to help him. The weapons embargo remains in place. Mr Latortue, installed following negotiations involving the US, France and Canada, complained the ban prevented him equipping the police. But according to Mr Muggah, despite Mr Latortue's public protestations, a number of arms sales have gone ahead. His report says 5,435 'military-style weapons', including M-14 and other semi-automatic guns and 4,433 handguns worth $ 6.95m, were provided from the US. Haiti is already awash with guns and violence. Human rights groups say supporters of Mr Aristide's political party, Lavalas, have been subjected to violence and oppression. The Haitian National Police (HNP) is also accused of carrying out a campaign violence in the slums of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Brian Concannon, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti (IJDH), which has links to the former government, said: 'It is well-documented that the Haitian police routinely execute political dissidents and suspected criminals, so with them the guns are already in the wrong hands. 'But many officers " especially those illegally integrated from the rebel army " funnel arms to paramilitary groups that are even more brutal.' A recent report by the human rights program at Harvard Law School said HNP members were 'perceived variously as crooked, politicized, ineffective and violators of human rights'. It added that the UN stabilization mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was not only complicit in HNP abuses, but that there were 'credible allegations of human rights abuses perpetrated by MINUSTAH itself'. Media reports have identified several Haitian Americans allegedly involved in an arms sale, raising suggestions that the deal was privately organized and sanctioned by the US, rather than an official sale of weapons by Washington. One of these, Joel Deeb, a self-styled 'freedom fighter', said that he had been approached by Mr Latortue's nephew, Youri, and given $ 500,000 to buy arms. 'I was given half a million dollars in the form of a letter of credit,' he said. 'But there is an embargo. There has not been any deal yet. The money is frozen. Everybody is saying I have done something with the money, but it is still there.' A State Department spokesman said restrictions on arms sales remained. He said the US would not sell arms to Haiti but would consider lifting the embargo on a case-by-case basis to allow third parties make the sales 'to be helpful' to the interim government.

Haiti's Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis said on December 9, 2006, the US government had threatened to impose sanctions against the troubled Caribbean country if its leaders refused to receive criminals of Haitian origin deported from the US. Jacques Edouard Alexis said he has had several discussions with US authorities about the threat posed by those deportations to the country's national security. But instead of reducing the number of deportations, the US administration has decided to increase them, he said. "The US told us the number of deportees will rise from 25 to 100 per month," Alexis said. "The US administration threatens to cut its assistance to the country and to revoke Haitian authorities' visas if they refused to receive those deportees." The US embassy in Port-au-Prince has denied having suggested that US assistance would be suspended, but did not rule out the possibility of revoking US visas held by Haitian officials if such measures, provided by US immigration laws, were necessary. A spokesperson for the embassy, Shaila Manyam, said the US and Haiti governments have engaged in talks over the issue of deportees and their re-integration into Haitian society if the Haitian government agreed to receive these citizens who have completed their jail time in the US. "At no time in these discussions did US officials suggest that US aid to Haiti was in jeopardy," Said Manyam. Alexis said his government was not categorically opposed to receiving Haitians deported from the US but he said that should be done in a way which does not further worsen the current violence and criminality partly blamed on dangerous criminals deported from the US. "Many of those deportees left Haiti when they were three or five years old. So they have learned to become criminals in the United States," said Alexis, calling on Washington to help Haiti cope with that difficult situation. 

US-Haiti relations have been characterized for the most part by coercion (both overt and subversive) and conflict. Following the occupation from 1915-1934, the US used economic and military means to influence Haiti's policy. There have been isolated disputes and the level of cooperation between the two states has fluctuated based on US interest in the region and US policy regarding human rights. While there have been periods of close alignment-World War II, the Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Reagan Administrations-there was always the underlying threat of force and economic coercion present. The majority of the post 1934 period can be characterized by negative peace: there exist conflicts of interest (human rights abuses, domestic instability in Haiti) and the possibility for the use of force. However, two periods in particular are characterized by low-level conflict: reaction to Duvalier abuses from 1960 to 1964 and sanctions and military force in response to upheavals from 1991 to 2006. US forces occupy Haiti from 1994 to 2000. At the end of the occupation, however, US-Haiti relations remain tense due to the appearance of corruption during the reelection of Aristide in 2000. These tensions remain as domestic opposition grows against Aristide, ending with the outbreak of violence and the eventual resignations of Aristide in 2004.
