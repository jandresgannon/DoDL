TERRMID-NOTES: MID1653 from cm narrative, a revolution took place in Mexico from 1910-1921. The president was overthrown in 1911, beginning a series of conflicts with the US over the presidency (the US wanted a friendly regime in place). These recurring political leadership disputes are separate from the territorial dispute the countries had. This MID was triggered when the US sent troops into Mexico during the revolution as a way of exerting influence over who took power. Coded not territory because US was not advancing a claim on Mexican territory in this MID.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID321 from James (2008), during the ongoing revolution in Mexico, Pancho Villa's army had been defeated in 1915 and was reduced to a small crew of bandits. Here, in 1916, Pancho Villa led a cross-border raid into US territory, leading the US to enter Mexico in search of Pancho Villa and triggering this MID. Coded not civil war because although this occurred during the Mexican revolution, Pancho Villa was at this point a bandit and his group was therefore not a militarized rebel group opposing the government.

Troops were concentrated on either side of the border, and a clash broke out, killing 5 Mexicans. The NYT says the exact cause of the clash is unknown, but officers thought that the Mexican troops were there to prevent US troops from pursuing bandits across the border. Coded not civil war because this was seemingly about the US pursuing bandits. Coded uncertain because the NYT says that the exact cause was unknown.

Coded not civil war because Pancho Villa's attack was a raid and raids themselves do not count as civil war MIDs. Pancho Villa no longer was a General or had an army at this point, and his group was therefore not a militarized rebel group opposing the government.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID3222 From Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-37), this involved the seizure of an American fishing vessel by Mexico. This was one of 25 seizures by Mexico around this time. Coded not maritime because there is no indication in cm narrative, GLM (2016), Schultz data, or New York Times that this maritime border was disputed, and the US never disputed that the boat was in Mexico's territorial waters. Coded uncertain because GLM recommend the MID be dropped as the US never protested this incident, and thus this should not be a MID.

NARRATIVE-CM: 
Mexico claimed the El Chamizal region near El Paso, Texas on September 28, 1895. Mexico and the United States signed an agreement in Washington DC on June 24, 1910, which provided for the submission of the El Chamizal dispute to arbitration. A three-member arbitration commission (US, Mexico, Canada) chaired by Eugene Lafleur of Canada issued a decision in favor of Mexico on June 15, 1911. The US government rejected the arbitration decision on August 24, 1911. Mexican troops detained eight US sailors in Tampico on April 9, 1914. The sailors were immediately released, but Admiral Henry Mayo demanded a 21-gun salute from the local Mexican commander, who refused to comply. US warships shelled Vera Cruz on April 21-22, 1913. Some 800 US troops occupied Vera Cruz on April 30, 1914. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile offered their good offices on April 25, 1914, which was immediately accepted by both countries. President Victoriano Huerta severed diplomatic relations with the US as a result of the occupation of Veracruz. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile ended their mediation efforts on July 2, 1914. US troops completed their withdrawal from Vera Cruz on November 23, 1914. Some 125 Mexicans and 19 US soldiers were killed during the seizure and occupation of Veracruz. Mexican rebels led by Pancho Villa attacked the US calvary garrison in the town on Columbus, New Mexico on March 9, 1916. Some 100 Mexicans and 19 Americans were killed in the raid. On March 15, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered General John Pershing and 12,000 troops to pursue Pancho Villa on Mexican territory. US troops clashed with Mexican troops near Parral on April 12, 1916, resulting in the deaths of some 100 Mexicans. President Carranza of Mexico condemned the US intervention in June 1916. Mexican troops and US troops clashed near Carrizal on June 21, 1916. US troops completed their withdrawal from Mexican territory on February 5, 1917. The US resumed diplomatic relations with Mexico on September 3, 1923. In 1925, the US rejected a Mexican proposal to submit the El Chamizal dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) at the Hague, Netherlands. Mexico expropriated land belonging to US oil companies on March 19, 1938, and the US protested against the land expropriation to the Mexican government on March 28, 1938. Mexico offered to provide compensation to the US on May 26, 1938. The US proposed arbitration in the dispute on July 21, 1938, but Mexico rejected the proposal on August 3, 1938. Mexico and the US signed an agreement on November 12, 1938, which provided for Mexican compensation for the expropriated land. Mexico and the US signed the Convention for the Solution of the Problem of the Chamizal in Mexico City on August 29, 1963, providing for the US recognition of Mexico's claim to some 437 acres of El Chamizal. The US formally transferred El Chamizal territory to Mexico on October 28, 1967.

NARRATIVE-CR: 
The rivlary between the US and Mexico was the result of three issues that both sides seemed unable to resolve. The first was territorial, beginning in the 19th century with the secession of Texas from Mexico in 1836. The US helped support and subsequently annexed Texas in 1845 which led to the Mexican-American war in 1846 (MID1552). The peace treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848 ended the war and formally settled land claims between the two countries. Additionally in 1853 Mexico and the US completed the sale of northern Mexico to the US which further facilitated the resolution of land claim issues in the region. Despite these events, border disputes continued with the US frequently moving into Mexican territory (MID2117 on 6/17/1870, MID1547 on 5/6/1873, and MID1545 on 4/20/1875). During his period, Mexico particularly sought claim to the El Chamizal territory near El Paso that the US had expropriated and began a dispute regarding the territory in 1895. The El Chamizal issue was the last territorial issue between the two countries and begins to be resolved in 1938 with the US and Mexico reaching an agreement that Mexico will be compensated for the land. In 1963 the US and Mexico sign the Convention for the Solution of the Problem of the Chamizal that recognizes Mexico's claim to some of the land. In October of 1967, the US formally transferred the territory to Mexico. The second issue was over the political leadership in Mexico itself. As early as 1860, the US intervened in Mexico to support pro-US leadership (MID1549 on 3/2/1860). 

Francisco Madero's social revolution from 1910-1921 and the overthrow of Porfirio Diaz as president began as a series of conflicts over the presidency that the US involved itself with. In 1911, the US sent troops into Mexico (MID1653). The US continued its interventions throughout the revolution, withholding or granting recognition to various leaders as the legal head of state in Mexico and backing its diplomatic positions with shows of force and partial occupation, i.e. Veracruz (MID2183 in 1913, MID136 in 1914 and MID1775 in 1915). This second issue was resolved when General Alvero Obregon comes to power in 1923 as Mexico's president officially recognized by the US. His successor, General Lazaro Cardenas became president in 1934, establishing the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI) as a stable, political dynasty until the most recent elections won by Vicente Fox. This stability in effect ends US intervention in the country. The third problem fueling the rivalry between the US and Mexico was border incursions in the 20th century and each state's legal right to deal with them. Pancho Villa's exploits into New Mexico in 1916 and Perhsing's push into Mexican territory (the last MID in the rivalry, MID2185, June 16, 1919) to apprehend him illustrates the nature of these incursions. The establishment of a claims commission in 1923, along with Pancho Villa's assassination helped to resolve these border issues. 

The last mid between the two countries occurred in 1956 (MID3222) but is over the US seizure of a Mexican fishing trawler and does not involve any of the issues of the now terminated rivalry.

SB-CR:
Mexico / United States Years: 1836-1923. Issues at stake: Border between US and Mexico; control over border intrusions and authority to deal with them. End coding: In 1923 the United States and Mexico established a claims commission to settle remaining claims regarding border problems (it was extended in 1929, 1932, 1934, 1941). Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 8. Last militarized dispute: 1920. Wars: 1846-48. Summary: The rivalry between Mexico and the US began with the secession of Texas from Mexico in 1836 and US efforts to encourage that secession. In 1845 Texas was admitted to the US as a state, setting the stage for the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848. In the 1848 Peace of Guadeloupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded all territory north of the Rio Grande, and in 1853 Mexico sold southern Arizona (then northern Mexico), completing the US territorial expansion in the southwestern United States. This treaty and sale set borders between the two states, and could have ended the rivalry, but border incursions by both sides and conflicting claims about who had authority to police the border continued through the late 1800s and early 1900s. The unstable political situation in Mexico contributed to friction, as different Mexican leaders pursued different policies regarding the border intrusions, and the US did not recognize the legitimacy of the Mexican government on more than one occasion. The US intervened militarily in the internal Mexican power struggle in 1860 and on several dates between 1911 and 1917. The 2nd Pershing Expedition (in which US military forces pursued Mexican rebels into Mexico) from 1918 to 1920 was the final militarized dispute between the US and Mexico. The Mexican civil war ended in 1920, and the stable political situation in Mexico since that time helped in allowing border issues to be settled amicably. Border issues were resolved formally through talks, with the establishment of a claims commission in 1923 to arbitrate any further claims and issues.
