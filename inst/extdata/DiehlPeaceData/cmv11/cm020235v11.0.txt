MARITMID-NOTES: MID4450 from cm narrative, a Canadian patrol boat seized a Portuguese fishing vessel, claiming that the boat was fishing in Canadian waters. Portugal protested, claiming the boat was in international waters. Occurred 5/29/2005-6/1/2005. Coded not maritime because Canada and Portugal did not dispute the maritime boundary, and this was an issue of whether the Portuguese vessel was located in the waters that both agreed Canada owned.
