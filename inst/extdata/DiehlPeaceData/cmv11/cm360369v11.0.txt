Ukraine joined the international system on December 26, 1991. Romania was the only country besides Russia that made territorial claims on Ukraine's territory after the latter's independence. Romania claimed that the territories of Northern Bucovina, the northernmost part of Bassarabia and the Hertsa region together with the Serpants' Island and a part of the Black Sea belonged to Romania, as they were part of Romania in 1940 when they were occupied by Soviet Union. Romania demanded than any major treaty between the two countries includes a note denouncing the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which basically annexed these former Romanian territories to Soviet Union, and later to Ukraine. Ukraine perceived this demand as a threat to national integrity. 

A territorial dispute between Romanian and Ukraine over the Black Sea Serpants' Island heated up on December 7, 1995, as Ukrainian officials criticised moves by Romania to bring the matter before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. "Ukraine will consider a unilateral attempt (on Romania's part) to bring this question before the International Court as a territorial claim," the Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman, Juri Sergeyev, said. Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu had Monday said his country wanted the International Court of Justice in The Hague to settle the territorial dispute if talks with Ukrainian officials did not make progress. The island located in the Black Sea near the mouth of the Danube River is thought to have rich oil and natural gas reserves. Bucharest claims the island was ceded to Romania in the 1947 Paris peace pact. The government in Kiev asserts that the island belongs to Ukraine, citing Romanian-Soviet protocols and agreements signed in 1948 and 1961 respectively according to which the island belonged to the Soviet Union.

In January 1997 the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Adrian Severin, changed Romania's policy towards Ukraine in a bid to join NATO.

On March 12, 1997, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration's foreign policy directorate, Volodymyr Ohryzko, considers Romania's "effective refusal" to recognize the existing land and sea border between Ukraine and Romania an "alarming and dangerous signal" against the background of the current processes that are taking shape in Europe.

According to a UNIAN correspondent, Ohryzko told a briefing that the text of the treaty had been agreed "for final approval" following the ninth round of the Ukrainian-Romanian talks in Kiev on preparing a basic treaty on good-neighbourliness and cooperation between the two states. Stressing that the sides had reached agreement regarding the main point in the treaty, namely "the establishment of the principle of inviolability of the existing border between Ukraine and Romania for the present time and for the future" ,Ohryzko said that, during the talks, the sides had also agreed on the formulation of issues concerning the delimitation of the continental shelf, which forms the border with Serpants' Island.

Several compromise versions had been reached on two provisions in the preamble which, in particular, touched on the "condemnation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact".

Ohryzko stressed that, after its return to Bucharest, the Romanian delegation had rejected the coordinated parts of the treaty and had put forward its own proposals, which, in Ohryzko's view, put back the negotiating process to the starting point and "cast doubt on all that has been achieved so far" . He stressed that Romania's stance did not accord with its aspiration to become a member of NATO.

Ohryzko noted that official Bucharest had proposed to continue the political dialogue at the level of foreign ministers in an effort to resolve the problem, which in his view, does not correspond to international practice. "We propose to draw a line under the past and to look to the future in our political relations," he said. Romania has no territorial claims against any country, and its security is linked to Ukraine's territorial integrity, among other factors, says a press release issued by the Romanian embassy in Ukraine on March 24, 1997. The draft Romanian-Ukrainian basic treaty's provisions on territorial aspects have been agreed, and no-one submitted them for discussion or is trying to do so, the document says. At the same time, the press release says that the Romanian Foreign Ministry has learned, with surprise and regret, of some of the statements made by Ukrainian officials at international forums in connection with the current talks on the text of the basic political treaty between Ukraine and Romania. The Romanian side believes that "misinforming international forums and the public at large by methods which are reminiscent of the nondemocratic and non-European past and exacerbating matters by using inappropriate rhetoric in relations between states affect Ukraine's interests, first and foremost, and its image in the world". The document also says that neither Ukraine nor Romania wanted the treaty to be signed in haste and, therefore, to be valid only until the NATO summit in Madrid. This should be a document for long-term strategic relations and a guarantee of regional stability and security.

Romania and Ukraine finally signed a treaty of friendship on June 2, 1997. The treaty leaves aside the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, provides protection for the Romanian ethnics living in Ukraine, and the continental shelf dispute and the ownership over the Serpants' Island was left to the international courts. 

The presidents of Romania and Ukraine, Ion Iliescu and Leonid Kuchma, signed on 17 June, 2003, at Cernauti, the treaty on the state frontier regime between the two countries. Iliescu and Kuchma considered that the signing of the treaty was a historical moment and expressed their hope on finalizing the agreement to define the sea frontiers of Romania and Ukraine in 2004. President Iliescu considered that the treaty regarding the regime of the state frontier was a modern technical document, adapted to the European standards, which allows Romania to fulfil its commitments to its EU partners as concerning the security of the Eastern border. The head of the Romanian state mentioned that the issue of marking the continental plateau of the Black Sea and of the exclusive economic regions was still under negotiations, but Romania considers the mentioned treaty as a favourable factor for a future consent in this delicate matter. He also said that, by concluding a mutual agreement in this respect, the two countries might give a good cooperation example in the European spirit.

On January 30, 2002, Romania and Ukraine signed an economic and trade cooperation protocol on the last day of a two-day official visit by Ukrainian Prime Minister Anatoly Kinakh Wednesday, the first of its kind by a Ukrainian government leader in a decade. Kinakh and Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase also signed a treaty on bilateral judicial cooperation.

On 19 August, 2005, Romanian Foreign Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu has recently told Rompres in an interview that the issue regarding the delimitation of the Black Sea continental shelf at the border between Romania and Ukraine should be approached in the context of the new political climate in both countries, of openness to dialogue and the stated mutual wish that a fair solution be found.

He said he suggested Ukraine a partnership for Europe as a modern cooperation base in view of Romania's accession to the European Union and the European aspirations of Ukraine.

The continental shelf and maritime border dispute between the two countries was finally settled in 2009 by the International Court of Justice.
