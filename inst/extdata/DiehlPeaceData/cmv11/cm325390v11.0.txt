CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2307 from Gibler 2018, this MID occurred in the lead up to WWII in 1937. Italian planes sunk a Danish cargo ship near Barcelona. Per Coverdale 1979, Denmark was signatory to a nonintervention pact to abstain from intervening in the Spanish Civil War. Italy was supporting the nationalists in the civil war. Italy suspected that Denmark was trying to covertly offer support to opposing forces in the war, violating the nonintervention pact, and attacked the Danish cargo ship. Coded civil war link because this was connected to the Spanish Civil War, outside this dyad.
