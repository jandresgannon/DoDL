PS-UPDATE2020: Sudan began supporting Eritrean rebel forces and later Ethiopia reciprocated by supporting Sudanese rebels.  The process begins in 1960 with the creation of the Eritrean Liberation Movement and shortly thereafter its military wing - this precipitates a lesser rivalry.  This is transformed into a severe rivalry starting in 1967 with a string of MIDs between the two states, even as Ethiopia is successful in helping end the Sudanese civil war in 1972. In 1997, the two sides sign a number of agreements and improve relations and there is only one more MID (2008) between 1997 and 2014. Tensions rise over border dispute starting in December 2020: https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/ethiopia/b173-containing-volatile-sudan-ethiopia-border-dispute and the led to a clash of military forces in December 2015

CIVWARMID-CER: MID2137 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2142 from Gibler, Miller and Little, This MID occurs in early 1957, when Ethiopia is combatting the Eritrean separatist movement. COW codes this an Ethiopian attack on Sudan, but their research shows that this is most likely an error. The attack occurs on the town of Umm Hagar in Eritrea, but since there is a similarly named town in Sudan, this may have caused a miscoding. Coded civil war MID because this involves Ethiopia fighting against organized rebels within Ethiopia (in this dyad). Coded uncertain because GLM recommend that this case be dropped because it is a domestic dispute rather than a MID.

The Sudanese military in March 2002 mobilized additional troops at its border with Eritrea to prevent any incursion into the state by SPLA rebels acting from bases in Eritrea. This was followed in April 2002 when Sudan places its border forces and general populace on alert after reports of SPLA rebels infiltrating the country from Eritrea. In October 2002, the dispute escalated, as the Sudanese government accused the Eritrean military of fighting alongside and supporting the SPLA during a military offensive beginning on October 5, leading to clashes between the two countries. On October 13, Sudan took several Eritrean soldiers prisoner after a clash. Sudanese and Eritrean military forces clashed again on October 18, near the countries shared border after Eritrean soldiers entered Sudanese territory. The news report states that the Eritrean soldiers were repelled by Sudanese forces. The last available incident was when, on October 21, the Sudanese internal security forces arrested several Eritreans, including two Eritrean diplomats, in Khartoum. First day of dispute was on 5/9/2008 and last day of dispute was on 7/8/2008.

President Numeiry of Sudan pledged to support Eritrean rebels on January 30, 1977. Ethiopia resumed attacks against Eritrean camps in Sudan in February 1977. Sudan alledged that Ethiopian troops had attacked the border town of Qallabat in Sudan on April 9, 1977, resulting in the deaths of three Sudanese soldiers. Ethiopia accused Sudan of attacking Ethiopian border towns, and accused Sudan of supporting Eritrea rebels on April 11, 1977. This is designated MID2142.

I could not find information on MID3000, which occurred between 2/27/1979 and 3/1/1979. 

MID3056 occurred when Ethiopian military aircraft attacked the Tokar region in Sudan on November 13, 1983, resulting in the death of one individual. Sudan placed its military forces on-alert on November 20, 1983.

The Ethiopian continued to provide tactical and logistical support for the SPLA throughout 1986 in its rebellion against the Sudanese government. This is classified as MID2803.

MID2802 occurred when Ethiopian troops and Sudanese troops clashed near Khasm al-Qirbah beginning on July 20, 1987. The countries signed a ceasefire agreement on July 28, 1987. Ethiopian military aircraft attacked an "agricultural camp" in eastern Sudan on August 9, 1987, resulting in the death of one civilian. 

Sudan accused Ethiopia of committing air raids on Sudan along the border on October 7, 1988 as part of Ethiopia's support for rebel groups in the Sudan. This was designated as MID2757. 

MID4079 refers to the continued violence in the Sudanese civil war between government forces and SPLA forces supported by Ethiopia in 1994.

Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan soured in 1995 when an Ethiopian police investigation into an assassination attempt against the Egyptian president, Hosny Mubarak, implicated Sudan. The incident took place at Addis Ababa airport when Mubarak was on his way to attend a summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in June 1997. The relations deteriorated further in 1996 when the SPLA and northern Sudanese opposition forces overrun several government positions in the Southern Blue Nile region of Sudan. Sudan accused Ethiopia and Eritrea of aiding the forces opposed to the Sudanese government. 

Ethiopian troops attacked and occupied the Taya area in Sudan on January 11, 1996. 

On January 8, 1997, thousands of refugees poured into Ethiopia from Sudan and Sudan's civil war escalated. On January 13, 1997, a Sudanese government statement accused Ethiopia of attacking Kurmuk and Qeissan. Ethiopia denied the accusation. This was designated MID4130.

President Omar Hassan Bashir of Sudan and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia held negotiations in Addis Ababa on November 20-21, 1999.

Negotiations are ongoing between rebel and government groups in Sudan as this is written. The conflict between Ethiopia's government and the Eritrean Liberation Front ended when Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia on May 21, 1991. Because the conflict in Sudan is ongoing, and because of the involvement of Ethiopia throughout this conflict, this rivalry should not be considered terminated at this time.

On January 1, 1957, Sudan became independent. On April 28, 1957, the Sudanese Premier Abdullah Khalil and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia pledged to work together to maintain peace in the region. On October 29, 1960, the President of Sudan, Ibrahim Abboud made an official visit to Ethiopia during which he met with Emperor Haile Selassie. On August 10, 1965, the Sudanese president received assurances from the Ethopian Emperor that Ethiopia will not allow any anti-Sudanese activities on its territory. The Ethiopian minister of foreign affairs expressed concerned on January 4, 1965 about Sudan's support of Eritrean rebels. Sudan's prime minister Sirr al-Khatm al-Khalifah denied the charge on February 9, 1965. Ethiopian troops attacked a Sudanese village near the border in March 1967, resulting in the deaths of two Sudanese. This is the start of RIV1140.

The last MID of RIV1140, MID4130 ended on January 13, 1997. On November 2, 1998, the Sudanese government has welcomed a move by the Ethiopian government to close down the office of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) at Gambela close to the border with Sudan. Commenting on the Ethiopian decision, President Omar Beshir's advisor on peace affairs, Adam al-Tahir Hamdoun, said that Ethiopia had shown its seriousness to normalize its relations with Sudan beginning with last week's resumption of Ethiopian Airline flight to Khartoum. "Although Ethiopia has not officially informed us about the closure of the SPLA office we are sure that it is capable of taking such a decision for the sake of good neighbourliness," Hamdoun said. The SPLA's expulsion from Gambela was first reported by a United Arab Emirates paper, al-Khaleej, which said it was timed with the Sudanese order to close the offices of the Ethiopian rebel Oromo Liberation Front in all parts of Sudan. The report said Ethiopia went as far as preventing Sudanese opposition groups from buying their food supplies from Ethiopian markets. Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan soured in 1995 when an Ethiopian police investigation into an assassination attempt against the Egyptian president, Hosny Mubarak, implicated Sudan. The incident took place at Addis Ababa airport when Mubarak was on his way to attend a summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in June 1997. The relations deteriorated further in 1996 when the SPLA and northern Sudanese opposition forces overrun several government positions in the Southern Blue Nile region of Sudan. Sudan accused Ethiopia and Eritrea of aiding the forces opposed to the Sudanese government. The normalization of relations between Sudan and Ethiopia is seen as a result of the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia. At the beginning of the conflict Sudan sided with Ethiopia to isolate Eritrea in the region because it considered Ethiopia less hostile to Sudan than Eritrea which hosted Sudanese opposition. 

On April 2, 1999, in an interview in Khartoum, the Sudanese President Omar el-Beshir talked about the opportunity for improved bilateral ties between Ethiopia and the Sudan. According to Beshir, "Ethiopia and Sudan are the cornerstones of peace and development in the Horn." He added that "there have been misunderstandings between us in the past (but) our relations have never been broken." After a three-year suspension, Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to Khartoum in October 1998. Relations were strained when Khartoum accused Addis of backing the Sudanese opposition fighting in eastern Sudan. The ties also received a blow as Ethiopia is seeking the extradition of two suspects, reportedly in the Sudan, who attempted to assassinate the Egyptian President in Addis on a visit in 1995.

Ethiopia-Sudan relations have eased following a recent visit to Ethiopia by Sudanese President Omar el-Beshir and his support for Addis Ababa in the conflict with Eritrea, government spokesman Hailekiros Gessesse said on November 20, 1999. Hailekiros told a press briefing that Sudan's refusal to extradite three Sudanese terrorists involved in an assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995 was no longer a barrier between the two states. "We still want the terrorists to be extradited and face trial, but if Sudan continues to refuse, we will not let it sour relations between us. When a country is at war, it has to amend its foreign policy," Hailekiros said. He added that Eritrea's actions had "brought all the neighboring countries-Ethiopia, Sudan and Djibouti-together to work against Eritrea." He also stressed that Ethiopia had never armed any Sudanese rebel group, including the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) southern rebels, and reiterated Ethiopia's commitment to mediate in the 16-year Sudanese conflict. "Ethiopia wants to maintain good contacts with all the opposition groups, as well as the government in Sudan to ensure that Ethiopian mediation between parties will be effective to bring peace and stability to Sudan," he said. Ethiopia has previously accused Sudan of supporting Ethiopia's rebel Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), but Hailekiros said that Addis Ababa was convinced that Khartoum was no longer supporting any Ethiopian rebel movement. Bashir paid a two-day working visit to Ethiopia the previous week, which focused mainly on "bilateral and regional issues." One of issues that he and Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi discussed was the need to promote trade and bilateral relations between the two nations, including possible sale of Sudanese oil to Ethiopia and use by Ethiopia of its Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. Since the conflict with Eritrea erupted 18 months ago, landlocked Ethiopia has relied mainly on the ports of Djibouti and Mombasa in neighboring Kenya for its imports and exports. "Why should we import from the Middle East when we can get much cheaper goods from our neighbor, Sudan? Also, since we don't have Assab and Massawa ports because of the conflict with Eritrea, using Port Sudan-like we did during the liberation struggle-is a possibility," Hailekiros added.

On September 1, 2000, three officials of the Ethiopian Petroleum Corporation were in Khartoum for talks with their Sudanese counterparts on the possibility of sourcing petroleum products from there. The team, led by the corporation's general manager, Gizaw Makonnen, left Addis Ababa and will spend a week in Sudan, discussing with Sudanese officials the amount and type of petroleum Ethiopia is interested to import. The outcome of the talks, particularly the amount of petroleum Sudan is willing to sale to Ethiopia, is to be announced after the visit, it said. The daily noted that the protocol agreement between the two neighbors signed in Khartoum in March 2000, had facilitated the holding of the current talks between officials of the petroleum corporations of the two countries. Ethiopia imported 1.3 million metric cubic tons of petroleum products during the 1999-2000 fiscal year that ended in June. In March 2000, Ethiopia and Sudan signed a broad protocol agreement covering petroleum, transport, security and political relations during Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin's visit to Khartoum. In a meeting in April of the Ethio-Sudan border development joint commission at the Sudanese town of Gedaref, some 350 kms south-east of Khartoum, the two sides agreed to expedite the construction of roads on both sides of their common border to revive a border trade. Earlier, the two countries reached a consensus for utilizing Port Sudan for the import and export of Ethiopian goods. Khartoum was to build roads from Gadareif, which is connected by rail to Port Sudan, to the Ethiopian border. Ethiopian was to do the same on its side of the frontier.

Ethiopia and Sudan signed the agreements on the road and telecommunications links on May 2, 2001, at their fifth joint ministerial commission meeting held in Addis Ababa. A communique issued at the end of the meeting described the signing of the accords as a fresh impetus to further explore the potential of bilateral cooperation, saying that the two sides reviewed the status of the implementation of the various bilateral agreements signed at the fourth joint ministerial commission meeting held in Khartoum, Sudan in March 2000. Both sides also emphasized the need to promote the road and telecommunications links between the two countries in order to facilitate the use of Port Sudan by Ethiopia and the import of petroleum and petroleum products from Sudan, according to the communique. Ethiopia and Sudan last year reached an agreement on the construction of a 2,160-km railway running from Port Sudan to Ethiopia's southern border town of Moyale through Sudan's town of Shewoke and Ethiopian cities of Mekele, Mille, Awash, Nazareth and Assela. Besides, the two countries also agreed to build a 2,240-km railway starting from Port Sudan via Sudan's border town of Galabat, Ethiopian border town of Metema, Gondar, Woldya, Mille to Moyale. Preparations were reportedly underway to seek local and foreign partnership to fund the projects, and Ethiopia has invited some foreign companies to do the study of the railway constructions. Also, during a meeting with Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, Ethiopian Prime Minister Melez Zenawi said that Ethiopia was willing to further consolidate its amicable and cordial ties with Sudan. Ismail, who was also head of the Sudanese delegation, arrived on April 28, 2001, to attend a three-day Ethio-Sudanese joint ministerial commission meeting.

The Khartoum government has agreed to provide Ethiopia with 85 percent of its oil requirements from 2002, it was reported on 21 June, 2001. The general manager of the Ethiopian Petroleum Organisation, Sisay Gebretsadik, said at the signing ceremony in Khartoum that Ethiopia would save US $7 million annually by importing fuel from Sudan rather than relying on imports from outside Africa. Ethiopia currently spends US $20 million buying oil from the international market. According to the agreement, Sudan will export 120,000 million tons of oil and a further 36,000 million tons of kerosene to Ethiopia annually. Ethiopia would also be allowed to build a fuel depot inside Sudanese territory in order to ensure a steady supply of oil and kerosene by road, ETV said. Sudan began exporting oil in 1999, and is currently producing about 220,000 barrels daily. 

Former rivals Sudan and Ethiopia have agreed to step up ties and to make it easier for landlocked Ethiopia to trade with the outside world via the Red Sea harbor at Port Sudan. A high-level Sudanese delegation led by First Vice-President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha ended a four-day official visit to Ethiopia on April 25, 2002. Among accords signed was an amendment to a three-year-old road transport agreement on upgrading a crucial highway. The road heads southeast from the Sudanese railway town of Gadaref to the border towns of Galabat (Sudan) and Matama (Ethiopia). Eritrea has upset the Ethiopians by dictating terms for trade via their port of Asmara, so Ethiopia has sought alternative access to the sea. Relations between Sudan and Ethiopia reached a low point in the late 1990s with both accusing the other of supporting rebel forces. Both countries are members of the group of 10 Nile riparian states that has been working for nearly a decade now on confidence building measures through a series of conferences on sharing the river fairly. 

On March 17, 2003, the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, arrived to Khartoum, Sudan. He was received by the president of the republic, Staff Lt-Gen Omar al-Bashir, ministers, senior government officials and members of Ethiopian fraternity living in Sudan. Soon after his arrival, the president of Sudan, Staff Lt-Gen Umar al-Bashir, held talks with the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, on bilateral relations and areas of joint cooperation between the Khartoum and Addis Ababa in various fields. The Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia said Al-Bashir and Zenawi discussed ways of linking the two countries by roads and railways. He pointed out that the talks touched on peace talks between the government and the rebels Sudan People's Liberation Movement. The Ethiopian prime minister said his country supported realization of peace to Sudan. He said Ethiopia would intensify its efforts in this regard. For his part, the president of the republic commended distinguished relations between Ethiopia and Sudan, stressing government's keenness to realize comprehensive just peace in the country.

On 25 July, 2003, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia will do everything it could to back the peace process in the Sudan as peace in that country was in its best interest. The premier made the remark while receiving a message from the Sudanese president, Omar Hasan al-Bashir, which was delivered by the president's adviser, Dr Ghazi Salah-al Din. Meles said on the occasion that Ethiopia, as a member of the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), would play its part to help maintain the peace in neighboring Sudan, a spokesman of the office of the prime minister said. The message from President Hasan al-Bashir was intended to inform the prime minister that the peace talks between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army was postponed by a month, according to the spokesman. The arising of some unexpected issues which must be dealt with carefully prompted the postponement of the peace talks, the envoy has told the prime minister. Dr Ghazi Salah-al Din, told journalists that he had learnt from the prime minister about Ethiopia's commitment to the peace process in the Sudan and the further enhancement of Ethio-Sudanese relations. Dr Ghazi said relations between Ethiopia and the Sudan have been continuously improving both in political and economic spheres. The good relations maintained between Ethiopia and the Sudan were built on the interests of the peoples of the two countries and could be exemplary to other neighboring countries, Dr Ghazi said.

On 19 May, 2004, the Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia said Sudan is committed to bolster bilateral relations with Ethiopia. Ambassador Osman El-Sayed Fadal El-Seed told Walta Information Centre that his country has set multi-sectoral cooperation with Ethiopia as its priority agendas. The ambassador said his country is currently engaged in infrastructural development that would help to realize mutual cooperation and development. According to the ambassador, a road that connects Qadarif town of Sudan to Metema of Ethiopia is under construction, while efforts are under way to upgrade telecommunication services. The two countries have now begun border trade and the Sudanese are buying grains and mineral water from Ethiopia, he said, adding that preparations are also under way to supply electric power to the Sudan. The ambassador denounced all terrorist attacks supported by Eritrea and perpetuated against Ethiopia and reiterated Sudan's commitment to clear its land from harboring perpetrators. According to the Ambassador, Sudan condemns anti-peace activities perpetrated by the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) from its territories. Sudan has reported to the African Union and the United Nations about Eritrea's intentions to disrupt peace in neighboring countries by recruiting and supporting terrorists, the ambassador said. The ambassador also noted that Sudan is closely collaborating with Ethiopia in security matters. He said Sudan believes that Ethiopia has equal right to the use of the Nile River and his country has interest to work together towards this effort. As far as the agreement on the use of Nile signed between the Sudan and Egypt is concerned, he said the agreement does not prohibit Ethiopia from using the river. The ambassador said the peace process between the Sudanese government and the SPLA rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army group is well under way and Ethiopia has been playing a major role for its success.

On 31 July, 2004, the Sudanese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Uthman al-Sayyid, stated that his country would cooperate with Ethiopia to ensure mutual security. In a press briefing, he said Sudan strongly resists terrorists and armed groups who try to cross the Sudanese border and create instability in Ethiopia. He said Sudan condemns all attempts of armed groups that infiltrate the long Sudanese border to attack Ethiopia after receiving training in Eritrea. According to the ambassador, Sudan has already been cooperating with Ethiopia in exchanging information about their common border and ensuring security. He said Sudan would cooperate with Ethiopia if the country takes the necessary action on those who entered the Gambela Regional State in western Ethiopia and settled illegally.

Although additional talks are needed on the claims of the Qadarif in eastern Sudan and Amhara in northwestern Ethiopia states on farm lands, the case has been prudently handled by the Ethio-Sudanese Border Commission, he added. The ambassador commended Ethiopia's efforts to solve the crisis in Darfur in collaboration with other sister African countries. Even if Sudan is disappointed over the decision passed by the UN Security Council regarding the situation in Darfur, it will cooperate for its implementation, Ambassador Uthman said, and dismissed the allegation that the government has committed genocide. The Sudanese government, he said, will welcome African peacekeeping forces to the area.

On May 3, 2006, the Sudanese Ambassador to Ethiopia said the flourishing relationship between Ethiopia and Sudan sets a good example to all other African countries. In an exclusive interview with WIC here, Ambassador Abu Zeid El Hassan AbuZeid, said the countries, in addition to fostering sisterly relations, have been registering impressive achievements in promoting legal trade, transportation and communication links and determining their boundaries through peaceful means. According to Abuzeid, the conducive political condition created by the countries has favored the flourishing trade. Even if the trade balance between the two countries inclines towards Sudan, the Sudan tries to supply oil to Ethiopia with a preferential price. Regarding illegal border trade between Ethiopia and Sudan, Abuzeid said since it is impossible to fully stop smuggling across the border the countries have legalized trade relations between bordering regions and towns by establishing customs posts. Ambassador Abu Zeid reiterated that Ethiopia and Sudan have made boundary an issue of development and cooperation rather than of conflict. According to him, Sudan has about 10 neighboring countries, but the way it manages its boundary issues with Ethiopia is exemplary to other African countries. The boundary of Ethiopia and Sudan is actually demarcated, yet the actual work on the ground remains a homework to both countries only because it is beyond their financial capacity.

He further said no major problem has arisen over the years in relation to boundary issues. Abuzeid added that minor skirmishes on border areas are normal and they are so minor that it has become possible to solve them through sub-commissions established under the Ethio-Sudanese Joint Boundary Commission and also through regional governments of the two countries without any need of intervention by the central governments of the countries. According to Abu Zeid, Ethiopia and Sudan are making lots of efforts in connecting through roads, electrification and Fiber Optics. He also said that efforts would be exerted to connect the two countries through railway as it will be very important for Ethiopia to use Port Sudan for export purposes. Abu Zeid has also commended the investment environment in Ethiopia, which allowed many Sudanese entrepreneurs to engage in different businesses, including pharmaceuticals, tannery, petroleum and agriculture. However, he pointed out, that more flexibility should be exercised in handling foreign investors. The Ambassador cited as an example the long time foreign investors waste queuing renew visas and staying permits every year.
