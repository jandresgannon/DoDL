MID2318 

TERRMID: MID2318 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID2318 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2318 Guyana and Suriname disputed their land boundary at the Corentyne River, an inland river boundary. The dispute is over where precisely the border within the river lies, whether it is the left bank or the center of the river. Here, four Suriname trawlers were confiscated by Guyana who claimed they were fishing in Guyana's territorial waters (Guyana regards the center of the river as the border). Coded territorial MID because this is an inland river boundary and the dispute over the boundary location led to this dispute.

TERRMID-CER: MID2326 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2326 from cm narrative, this MID occurred in 1978 on the Corentyne River, the disputed border between Guyana and Suriname. (The Corentyne is an inland river boundary, thus making this a land border rather than a maritime border.) Suriname used gunboats to harass Guyanaese loggers on the Corentyne River, triggering this MID. Coded territorial MID because the disputed border led to this MID.

TERRMID-CER: MID4156 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4156 from cm narrative, during a dispute about oil exploration rights granted by Guyana in the territorial waters claimed by Suriname, Guyanese officials claimed that on June 3, 2000, a Surinamese aircraft intruded into Guyanese airspace on a reconnaissance mission. The same night one or two (depending on reports) Surinamese boats came to the mouth of the disputed Corentyne River between the two countries. A gulf exists at the mouth of the river that is disputed between the countries. Surinamese forces ordered the CGX oil rig (a Canadian oil exploration company operating under a Guyanese permit) to leave the area in 12 hours. CGX moved its rig outside the disputed area. Guyanese officials issued a protest, but the Surinamese government claimed they were protecting their rights and territory. Troop and armament buildups occurred by both countries shortly thereafter. Coded not territory because although this dispute involved confrontation on the Corentyne River, the disputed border between these countries, this dispute was triggered by oil resources in the disputed waters (the gulf at the mouth of the river), not by the territorial boundary.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4156 this MID was also connected to the disputed maritime border between Guyana and Suriname. Guyana granted oil exploration rights to a company in the disputed waters, beginning the hostile exchanges that this MID comprises. Coded maritime MID because this involves a dispute over the contested waters.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID4157 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIC-24), this MID is an extension of MID4156 and should be dropped, with MID4156 being retained. Here, Surinamese soldiers violated Guyanese maritime boundaries in the disputed gulf waters where the CGX oil rig was recently expelled by Guyana. GLM argue that this is an extension of MID4156 due to a lack of temporal separation and the fact that the tensions were from the same event in the same location. Coded maritime MID because this is connected to the CGX oil rig in the disputed waters of the gulf near the mouth of the Corantyne River, but coded uncertain because GLM recommend this case be dropped.

Guyanese officials issued a protest, but the Surinamese government claimed they were protecting their rights and territory. While Foreign Minister level negotiations were going on between Guyana and Suriname, Guyana started to deploy "a few hundred soldiers" along the river on June 4; the Guyanese government confirmed the reports. The following day, on June 5, as a response to the Guyanese buildup along the Corentyne River, Suriname started to send antiaircraft weapons, troops, low flying aircraft, and gunboats to the border. Despite a second round of Foreign Minister level negotiations starting on June 6th, which resulted in a joint communiqu√©, Guyana accused Suriname on June 10 of violating its airspace. Locals along the border said both sides were guilty of airspace. First day of dispute was on 6/3/2000 and last day of dispute was on 6/00/2000.

Following the transfer of Guyana from Dutch to British ownership at the turn of the 19th century Guyana and Suriname, two countries experienced problems regarding their undetermined border. The Corentyne River is one of the disputed areas. Suriname has been strengthening its army in near past while Guyanese coast guard has been under-funded. In September 2000, Surinamese soldiers pursued an unlicensed speedboat to shore at Scotsburg, Guyana. The boat was occupied either by civilians or by criminals/smugglers. Residents in the area claimed shots were fired during the incident and that Surinamese soldiers tried to relaunch the boat in the water. The Guyanese complaint was based on the fact that the incident took place on their territory. The two countries' presidents talked about the incident when they met at the South American leaders' summit in Brazil. Guyana's President Venetiaan said that the incident should not be exaggerated and used as an excuse to raise tensions. Opposition in Guyana used this incident to call for increased military spending. First and last day of dispute was on 9/00/2000.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The Kutari-Curuni River which flows into the Corentyne River in the upper reaches of that river has traditionally been recognized as forming the southernmost line of the boundary between Suriname and Guyana. The area immediately to the west of the Kutari-Curuni River was also recognized as being within the boundaries of the colony British Guiana. Before May 26, 1966, the Government of the United Kingdom exercised uninterrupted sovereignty over this area, a fact which has been consistently acknowledged by the Government of the Netherlands. From May 26, 1966 the state of Guyana has continued to exercise this uninterrupted sovereignty. The New River, which also flows into the Corentyne River, is located west of the Kutari-Curuni River. From around the 1960s, the Dutch authorities began to suggest that this river was the upper part of the Corentyne River and should form the boundary between Suriname and Guyana. It is on the basis of this argument that Suriname, since the mid-1960s, began to claim the area of Guyana that lies between the Kutari-Curuni and the New Rivers. This contention has been pursued intermittently in the past and is, in the view of the government of Guyana, entirely without foundation in international law and morality. Guyana's position on this matter is based on the history of Guyana and Suriname and in actions that have previously been taken to settle the boundary between them. Dutch troops occupied territory in a disputed region between Guyana and Suriname on August 19, 1969. Dutch troops withdrew from the territory on September 10, 1969. Oil exploration licenses have been issued before by Guyana for what is now being called the area of overlap (the area near to Suriname's border extending into the Atlantic Ocean). In fact there was drilling there in 1974-75, which again produced no protest from Suriname. In 1975 diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. 

On 14th April 1979 the Prime Ministers of Guyana and Surinam left Barbados after finishing their talks on the border dispute without signing a formal agreement on the talks. The border problem involved "a 6,000 square mile triangle of land in the interior with their joint border which links with the frontier of Brazil. Control of the Corentyne river is also in contention." In fall 1979 talks between the two Prime Ministers in Guyana conveyed that when the President of Guyana Forbes Burnham will make his first visit to Surinam agreements on trade and economic co-operation would probably be signed. In March 1989 Suriname's president Ramsewak Shankar said that the time has come for Guyana and Suriname to establish rules and regulations for border traffic between the two countries. Shankar, who was on a 30-hour state visit to Guyana, made the remarks when addressing the national assembly in Georgetown. The president suggested that the two countries jointly develop energy potential "with interested neighboring countries experienced in this field." He also called for cooperation in agriculture, fishery exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons. The Suriname leader told the assembly that the illegal traffic of goods between Guyana and Suriname, "as well as all issues which have remained open as far back as 1969," should also be discussed. In July 1989 a cooperation council set up to monitor all aspects of relations between Guyana and Suriname held its inaugural meeting in Paramaribo during a visit by Guyana's Foreign Minister Rashleigh Jackson. The council will establish arrangements for promoting and strengthening cooperation to the mutual advantage of the South American neighbors. That agreement is expected to provide a framework for strengthening the efforts of the two countries in combating drug abuse. The ministers also held discussions on economic and political developments in their respective countries. They expressed the desire for the private sector to fulfill a major role in the development process and the co-operation between the two countries. In August 1989, the private sectors of Guyana and Suriname agreed to establish a joint private sector council to promote trade and cooperation. According to news reports here, the decision to set up the council was taken during talks last week between representatives of the private sector organizations of the two countries in Georgetown. Alston Kim Kissoon, president of the Guyana manufacturers association, said the first meeting of the council, scheduled to be held in Suriname on October 3, 1989 will formulate joint approaches to matters such as dealing with multilateral institutions, personnel training and consultancy and joint ventures aimed at producing goods for markets in third countries. Kissoon said the delegations from the two countries agreed they should first step up bilateral trade. Suriname is interested in importing a number of items including polypropelene bags (for rice), 600 tons of cassava a month, sugar, refrigerators, stoves, cereals, snack foods, cardboard boxes and hewn squares of timber, while Guyana is interested in importing sulphuric acid and stock feed from Suriname, Kissoon said. The Minister of Home Affairs from Guyana was held hostage in September 1990 for several hours by armed Surinamese rebels. The incident took place on the Corentyne River which forms the border between Guyana and Suriname. On the maritime boundary between the two countries, both presidents agreed that pending settlement of the border question, the authorities responsible for petroleum development in both countries should agree that the area of the north eastern and north western seaward boundaries could be jointly utilized by the two countries. This agreement reached by both Presidents developed in the Memorandum of Understanding of 1991, in essence formally endorsed the intent of the third draft treaty of 1961. It was the culmination of over two decades of consummate diplomacy and the mutual respect generated between two neighboring states. In February 1991, the Memorandum of Understanding was agreed upon by the two countries and signed by Dr. Cedric Grant, Ambassador and Special Adviser to the President of Guyana, and Dr. John Kolader, Ambassador of Suriname to Guyana. It provided for the exploitation of petroleum resources in the "Area of Overlap" for the benefit of both countries pending a resolution of the border dispute. This agreement was never ratified by the Surinamese Parliament. From time to time, the Suriname authorities have arrested Guyanese fishermen for using unlicensed boats in the Corentyne River. In most cases, diplomatic intervention by Guyana would lead the release of the fishermen and their boats. During a state visit to Suriname in 1994 by President Cheddi Jagan, the two Governments agreed that the meetings of the National Border Commissions and the Guyana/Suriname Cooperation Council, which had earlier been established, would be resuscitated to facilitate timely consultations and to establish a basis for resolution of the dispute. In spite of several initiatives from Guyana, the meetings of the Commissions have not been held. In 1995 Suriname was admitted as a full member of CARICOM. The country's application for membership was firmly supported by Guyana. The Guyana-Suriname Ferry, jointly operated by both countries, began operation in 1998. Guyana and Suriname disputed a concession awarded by Guyana to the Canadian oil company CGX Energy Inc. in 1998. Guyana and Suriname ended negotiations concerning the offshore oil concession on June 18, 2000.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between Guyana and Suriname involves unresolved disputes over territory and the formal delineation of both land and maritime borders around the Corentyne River and its tributaries. From 1976 to 1978 Guyana and Suriname experienced two militarized disputes over their border, MID2318 and MID2326. These disputes resulted in the confiscation of four Suriname trawlers by Guyana which claimed they were fishing in Guyana's territorial waters, along with Suriname's use of gunboats to harass Guyanaese loggers on the Corentyne River. Guayana and Suriname disputed a concession awarded by Guyana to the Canadian oil company CGX Energy Inc. in 1998. Guyana and Suriname ended negotiations concerning the offshore oil concession on June 18, 2000. On June 4, 2000 two Surinamese naval boats forced the Canadian company to remove its oil rig after the country claimed that it was in Suriname's territorial waters, MID4156. On June 8, Guyana protested the action as a hostile act. On September 8, 2000 Suriname soldiers came ashore from a gunboat in Scotsburg, Guyana in an effort to seize a Guyanese boat that had crossed over into the Suriname side of the Corentyne River, MID4157. However, relations between the two countries have improved to some extent in 2001-02, owing to discussions held between their presidents and foreign ministers, and the setting up of a joint border commission. Proposals for the joint exploitation of the disputed area will be difficult to finalize, as they are likely to be portrayed as a betrayal of national sovereignty by opposition parties in each country. In March 2003, Suriname reopened the rift with the circulation of new maps to foreign embassies that show the disputed New River Triangle area as its own territory. Guyana sent a letter flagging its concern to Suriname and all the embassies, as well as dispatching its main gunboat to patrol the border with Suriname. The move followed Guyanese criticism of Suriname for its publication of a national map that includes land claimed by Guyana. The gunboat set sail to signal the government's "firm response" to any designs Suriname may have on its territory. "It is a show of force and a direct response to the publication of the maps." As long as the area remains the centre of the dispute, proposals for its joint exploitation will be difficult to finalize and firms are likely to be cautious before committing themselves to pay up for any concessions. According to geological surveys the potential for oil finds is good. In February 2004, Guyana referred the maritime dispute to arbitration under the UN Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. The Guyanese claim rests on the principle of equi-distance, whereas Suriname appears to base its case on a 1936 draft treaty between the UK and the Netherlands. This draft treaty, which was not signed by either party, covers the territorial sea but not the EEZ, and its allocation of the New River triangle to Guyana is not accepted by Suriname. However, the onshore dispute with Guyana cannot be resolved through the maritime boundary tribunal, and will remain a source of friction. Suriname claims possession of a triangular area in the south-west, between the rivers known to the Surinamese as the Boven Corantijn and the Curuni, and to the Guyanese as the New River and the Upper Courantyne. In September 2007, The UN International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea ruled in favor of Guyana in its long-standing maritime dispute with Suriname. Guyana filed a dispute in 2004 over its maritime border beyond the mouth of the River Corentyne. On December 30, 2004, Guyana has protested to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) after Surinam blocked the country's efforts to access historical records in the Netherlands archives on their border dispute. In May 2006 Guyana said it is willing to send assistance to flood stricken Suriname once the authorities there identify the areas where such aid is needed. In August 2006, 200 Surinamese troops were deployed to the border with Guyana in case there would be instability in the region due to the elections in Guyana. The UN Tribunal ruled on 20 September 2007 that the boundary should follow, for the most part, "the equidistance line" between the two countries. This favors Guyana, which gains sovereignty over 33,152 km2 of coastal waters; Suriname was awarded 17,871km2. The resolution of this dispute, which is now final and binding on the parties, will allow Guyana and Suriname to put this controversy behind them, and to proceed to cooperate as good neighbors.

Proposals for the joint exploitation of the disputed area will be difficult to finalize, as they are likely to be portrayed as a betrayal of national sovereignty by opposition parties in each country. In March 2003, Suriname reopened the rift with the circulation of new maps to foreign embassies that show the disputed New River Triangle area as its own territory. Guyana sent a letter flagging its concern to Suriname and all the embassies, as well as dispatching its main gunboat to patrol the border with Suriname. The move followed Guyanese criticism of Suriname for its publication of a national map that includes land claimed by Guyana. The gunboat set sail to signal the government's "firm response" to any designs Suriname may have on its territory. "It is a show of force and a direct response to the publication of the maps." As long as the area remains the centre of the dispute, proposals for its joint exploitation will be difficult to finalize and firms are likely to be cautious before committing themselves to pay up for any concessions. According to geological surveys the potential for oil finds is good. In February 2004, Guyana referred the maritime dispute to arbitration under the UN Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. The Guyanese claim rests on the principle of equi-distance, whereas Suriname appears to base its case on a 1936 draft treaty between the UK and the Netherlands. This draft treaty, which was not signed by either party, covers the territorial sea but not the EEZ, and its allocation of the New River triangle to Guyana is not accepted by Suriname. However, the onshore dispute with Guyana cannot be resolved through the maritime boundary tribunal, and will remain a source of friction. Suriname claims possession of a triangular area in the south-west, between the rivers known to the Surinamese as the Boven Corantijn and the Curuni, and to the Guyanese as the New River and the Upper Courantyne. In September 2007, The UN International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea ruled in favor of Guyana in its long-standing maritime dispute with Suriname. Guyana filed a dispute in 2004 over its maritime border beyond the mouth of the River Corentyne. On December 30, 2004, Guyana has protested to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) after Surinam blocked the country's efforts to access historical records in the Netherlands archives on their border dispute. In May 2006 Guyana said it is willing to send assistance to flood stricken Suriname once the authorities there identify the areas where such aid is needed. In August 2006, 200 Surinamese troops were deployed to the border with Guyana in case there would be instability in the region due to the elections in Guyana. The UN Tribunal ruled on 20 September 2007 that the boundary should follow, for the most part, "the equidistance line" between the two countries. This favors Guyana, which gains sovereignty over 33,152 km2 of coastal waters; Suriname was awarded 17,871km2. The resolution of this dispute, which is now final and binding on the parties, will allow Guyana and Suriname to put this controversy behind them, and to proceed to cooperate as good neighbors.

Discussion:
The rivalry between Guyana and Suriname involves unresolved disputes over territory and the formal delineation of both land and maritime borders around the Corentyne River and its tributaries. From 1976 to 1978 Guyana and Suriname experienced two militarized disputes over their border, MID2318 and MID2326. These disputes resulted in the confiscation of four Suriname trawlers by Guyana which claimed they were fishing in Guyana's territorial waters, along with Suriname's use of gunboats to harass Guyanaese loggers on the Corentyne River.

Discussion:
MID4156 During a dispute about oil exploration rights granted by Guyana in the territorial waters claimed by Suriname, Guyanese officials claimed that on June 3, 2000, a Surinamese aircraft intruded into Guyanese airspace on a reconnaissance mission. The same night one or two (depending on reports) Surinamese boats came to the mouth of the disputed Corentyne River between the two countries. Surinamese forces ordered the CGX oil rig (a Canadian oil exploration company operating under a Guyanese permit) to leave the area in 12 hours. CGX moved its rig outside the disputed area. Guyanese officials issued a protest, but the Surinamese government claimed they were protecting their rights and territory. While Foreign Minister level negotiations were going on between Guyana and Suriname, Guyana started to deploy "a few hundred soldiers" along the river on June 4; the Guyanese government confirmed the reports. The following day, on June 5, as a response to the Guyanese buildup along the Corentyne River, Suriname started to send antiaircraft weapons, troops, low flying aircraft, and gunboats to the border. Despite a second round of Foreign Minister level negotiations starting on June 6th, which resulted in a joint communiqu√©, Guyana accused Suriname on June 10 of violating its airspace. Locals along the border said both sides were guilty of airspace. 
On June 4, 2000 two Surinamese naval boats forced the Canadian company to remove its oil rig after the country claimed that it was in Suriname's territorial waters, MID4156. On June 8, Guyana protested the action as a hostile act.

Discussion:
MID4157 Following the transfer of Guyana from Dutch to British ownership at the turn of the 19th century Guyana and Suriname, two countries experienced problems regarding their undetermined border. The Corentyne River is one of the disputed areas. Suriname has been strengthening its army in near past while Guyanese coast guard has been under-funded. In September 2000, Surinamese soldiers pursued an unlicensed speedboat to shore at Scotsburg, Guyana. The boat was occupied either by civilians or by criminals/smugglers. Residents in the area claimed shots were fired during the incident and that Surinamese soldiers tried to relaunch the boat in the water. The Guyanese complaint was based on the fact that the incident took place on their territory. The two countries' presidents talked about the incident when they met at the South American leaders' summit in Brazil. Guyana's President Venetiaan said that the incident should not be exaggerated and used as an excuse to raise tensions. Opposition in Guyana used this incident to call for increased military spending.
