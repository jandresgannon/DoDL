TERRMID: MID1407 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1407 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1407 from IRIN 2005, the islands disputed between Benin and Niger had implications for the land boundary in the inland river boundary between the countries. When the ICJ handed down a ruling on the islands dispute in 2005, it also delineated the land border by awarding the islands and using them to set the land boundary. This is therefore connected to a land boundary dispute.

RIVNOTES: 

NARRATIVE-CM:
Dahomey (Benin) and Niger disputed the sovereignty of Lete Island in the Niger River. On December 22, 1963, the Niger government ordered all Dahomeans to leave the country. Nigerien troops occupied Lete Island on December 22, 1963. President Soglo of Dahomey closed transportation links with Niger on December 27, 1963. Dahomey deployed troops near the border. On January 24, 1964, the countries re-opened the border following mediation by President Yameogo of Upper Volta, president of the *Union Africaine et Malgache* (UAM). UAM heads-of-state appealed for a troop withdrawal and peaceful negotiations in March 1964. The countries announced an end to the crisis concerning Lete Island on June 15, 1965. Eight Nigeriens were killed during the crisis. Benin and Niger agreed to submit the dispute concerning Lete Island to the *International Court of Justice *(ICJ) on June 24, 2000.
