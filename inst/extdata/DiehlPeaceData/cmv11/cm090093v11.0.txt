CIVWARMID-CER: MID1205 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1205 from cm090091v11.0 narrative, this MID is the Second Central American War that occurred 3/15/1906-7/1906. Nicaragua (aong others) was assisting exiled liberal Guatemalans overthrow the conservative Guatemalan government in an ongoing revolution, leading to this multilateral MID. Central American states regularly interfered in each other's domestic politics to influence the type of regime in power, along conservative/liberal lines. Coded civil war MID because a civil war was ongoing in this dyad (Guatemala), and that civil war contributed to the events of this MID.

TERRLINK-CER: MID1204 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1204 from cm090091v11.0 narrative, President Zelaya of Nicaragua had been supporting liberal forces throughout Latin America, prompting El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras (with Liberal President Bonilla - an adversary of Zelaya) and exiled Nicaraguan conservatives to try and force Zelaya from power. In that month, Nicaragua had occupied Honduras and threatened to invade Guatemala from Honduras, triggering this MID. Guatemala, among others, responded with a threat to invade Nicaragua-occupied Honduras to expel Nicaragua. Coded not third party link to territory because although Nicaragua was occupying Honduras, it was not claiming their territory and this was connected to a political leadership issue. Thus, the threat of invasion by Guatemala here was not tied to a territorial dispute between Nicaragua and Honduras.

CIVWARMID: MID1204 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1204 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1204 coded civil war MID because this was connected to Nicaraguan support for liberal forces (rebel groups) in Guatemala, and Guatemala in turn supported conservative rebels in trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan regime.

CIVWARLINK: MID1204 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1204 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1204 coded civil war link because this also involved liberal forces (rebel groups) fighting in El Salvador and Honduras (outside of this dyad), who also participated in this MID against Nicaragua. It was a regular policy of Central American countries to interfere with each other's regimes at this point in time.
