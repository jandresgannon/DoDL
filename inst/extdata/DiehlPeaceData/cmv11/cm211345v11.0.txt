TERRLINK-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, Serbia's President Milosevic did not want Yugoslavia to break up into independent republics and attacked Croatia and Bosnia to prevent this. Yugoslavia thought the Yugoslavian states should not have their own boundaries independent of a Yugoslavian state. They therefore refused to recognize the independence of states that declared independence from Yugoslavia, still claiming their territory as part of Yugoslavia. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Belgium (as part of UN/NATO) became involved in this MID, which is territorial, civil war, and civil war link. See CIVWARMID and CIVWARLINK.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID3551 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3551 from cm narrative, MID3551 covers the break up of the former Yugoslavia and the fighting in the three former republics of Yugoslavia, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were civil wars in which the UN and NATO intervened. Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina all elected non-communist and nationalist/independence parties in their elections and began to make preparations for secession from Yugoslavia. President Milosevic of Serbia would not allow a breakup of Yugoslavia. Milosevic and other Serb leaders sent guerrillas into Serb-majority districts in Croatia, armed the villagers, and the newly armed villagers violently invaded non-Serb majority districts and occupied them. Eventually, Croatian militias began fighting to retake the districts. Coded civil war MID because civil war within Yugoslavia eventually convinced NATO and UN states to intervene and put a stop to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The US, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, and Italy all took part in shows of force, a blockade, and/or a no fly zone over Yugoslavia, pulling them all into this MID against Yugoslavia.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID4137 from cm narrative, this is the Kosovo conflict, February 1998-June 1999. Fighting erupted in Kosovo between ethnic Albanians and Serbs, and Serbian President Milosevic sent troops to fight inside Kosovo. UN/NATO militarily intervened to stop the violence, triggering their involvement in this MID. Coded third party link to territory because Kosovo had declared independence, but Serbia did not recognize them and declared Kosovo as part of its territory in the interest of "protecting" the ethnic Serbs there.

NARRATIVE-CR:
MID3551 In response to Yugoslav involvement in Bosnian civil war, Western countries first showed force and then began a blockade against Yugoslavia. On 7/16/1992 there was a show of force by USA, UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Italy. 

MID4137 In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99.

MID4186 This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat.

PS-NARRATIVE:

19460131-19920715 0.5

On July 2nd, 1947, the Belgian representative to the United Nations, Fernand van Langenhove, defended a UN Balkan Commission's proposal to establish a semi-permanent UN commission on the Balkans for a period of 2 years to deal with any border incidents in the region. Yugoslavia was adamant that such a commission is not necessary and attacked the proposal as a Western (mainly American) inspired threat on the Balkans. 

In October 1970, the Yugoslav leader, Tito, made an official visit to Belgium. An Albanian Croat organization called HDP has claimed responsibility for the attack committed on 14th July, 1981, on two members of the Yugoslav Embassy in Brussels. The tolerant attitude of the Belgian authorities towards anti-Yugoslav terrorism did not accord with the good relations between the two countries, and such conduct may have serious consequences for relations between Yugoslavia and Belgium. It was particularly to be regretted that the Belgian government, by its conduct, had encouraged anti-Yugoslav terrorism even more. The Belgrade daily 'Politika', in its issue of 15th July, asked how much longer such acts would go on, and recalled that approximately ten anti-Yugoslav acts were carried out in Belgium this year. On 15th July, 1981 the Yugoslav Ambassador to Belgium, Esad Ceric, handed a strongly-worded note of protest against a series of anti-Yugoslav terrorist actions on Belgian territory to Belgian Foreign Minister Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb. The ambassador demanded protection for Yugoslav representative offices and citizens in Belgium, and underlined that the further toleration of anti-Yugoslav activities could seriously affect relations between the two countries. Minister Nothomb expressed deep regret on the part of the Belgian government, which he said had taken certain measures over the past few months but these had failed to prevent the assassination attempt. He promised that the Belgian government would examine the possibilities of taking further security measures.

The Yugoslav Prime Minister, Milka Planinc, made an official visit to Belgium on April 26, 1983. The visit's communique stresses that both sides had expressed satisfaction about the normalization of bilateral relations which had gone through a difficult period two years ago following a series of assassinations and attacks on Yugoslav persons and property in Belgium. Expressing deep regret about these events, Belgium has confirmed its resolve to prevent these events from repeating themselves as well as the emergence of other forms of anti-Yugoslav terrorism and subversion. The communique stresses that the visit provided an incentive to the constant improvement of bilateral co-operation in all spheres of joint interest. The two sides stressed the need to increase and balance out the trade and they stressed the use of higher forms of economic co-operation on a lasting basis, above all of joint investments and ventures on third markets. The two sides noted that the agreement on long-term economic co-operation between Yugoslavia and the European Community provided fresh opportunities in this direction. Yugoslavia expressed satisfaction about Belgium's understanding of and financial support for the programme for the stabilization of the Yugoslav economy. Fresh possibilities for the expansion of financial co-operation and their favorable effects on the development of the entire economic and bilateral relations were pointed out during the talks. As regards the international situation, the representatives of Belgium and Yugoslavia noted the great closeness of views on a series of questions. Wilfried Martens, the Belgian Premier, accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Yugoslavia. The release of the communique had been preceded by a plenary session of the Yugoslav and Belgian delegation, led by the head of diplomacy Leo Tindemans and Milka Planinc, President of the Federal Executive Council. The representatives of the two countries exchanged views on the international situation, after which Leo Tindemans and Yugoslav ambassador Esad Ceric exchanged the instruments of ratification of the Yugoslav-Belgian agreement on avoiding double taxation.

At a meeting of the Belgian section of the Yugoslav Chamber of Economy, held in Belgrade on 22nd October, 1985 it was noted that the closure of the market of the European Economic Community had affected the trade, particularly the textile business. Exports to Belgium were worth 28,200,000 dollars, one-fifth less than in the same period of last year, and imports 75,400,000, an increase of 25%. Belgium is the world's leading per capita exporter, but Yugoslavia is not even among her 50 biggest foreign trade partners, whereas Belgium is Yugoslavia's 20th partner.

On November 23, 1985, Yugoslav and Belgian government representatives signed an agreement on rescheduling Yugoslavia's repayment of a debt which falls due in may newt year. Under the agreement signed in Brussels, the Belgian government will refinance the Yugoslav debt, which amounts to 735 million Belgian francs (14 million US dollars), over a 10-year period. Budimir Loncar, Yugoslavia's Foreign Minister arrived in Brussels on 17th April, 1989, for a three-day official visit at the invitation of his counterpart Leo Tindemans. On the same day he had a meeting with Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain. Both sides urged stimulating bilateral economic co-operation, and Minister Urbain commented that Yugoslavia's trade deficit with Belgium could be decreased by increasing the volume of trade, and particularly by taking advantage of the possibilities offered by the Yugoslav economic reform and its opening towards the world market. Later, Loncar had talks with Abel Matutes, the European Commission's Commissioner of Mediterranean Policy and North-South Relations, in which relations between Yugoslavia and the European Community were discussed, as well as Yugoslavia's social and economic reforms and the situation in Kosovo. Commissioner Matutes noted that there was concern among the EC countries over the situation in Yugoslavia. Regarding specific issues of advancing co-operation the Yugoslav Foreign Secretary stressed the need for the European Community to have a more flexible approach to the problem of increasingly frequent anti-dumping procedures which weighed heavily on the country's exports to the EC. The following day Loncar met Foreign Minister Tindemans for talks in which they agreed that the market-orientated reforms in Yugoslavia should lead to the country's closer economic integration with the EC. Minister Tindemans stressed that there was scope for expansion in relations between Yugoslavia and the EC. Loncar then had talks with Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, who spoke in favor of Yugoslavia being granted special status in relations with the EC and supported its efforts to join EFTA. The Yugoslav Foreign Secretary stressed that human freedoms were the main feature of the country's overall development, but, with reference to Kosovo, although they had no wish to resort to repression, preferring to solve problems in democratic ways, there must be peace and order. 

The first MID of RIV510, MID3551 In response to Yugoslav involvement in Bosnian civil war, Western countries first showed force and then began a blockade against Yugoslavia. On 7/16/1992 there was a show of force by USA, UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Italy.

He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.On May 7, 2003, the Serbian Defense Minister B. Tadic visited Belgium.
