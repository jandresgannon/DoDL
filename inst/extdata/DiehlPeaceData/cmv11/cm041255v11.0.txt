TERRMID-NOTES: MID1632 from cm narrative, this is one of several MIDs that occurred between 1872 and 1911. On these occasions, Germany deployed naval vessels off the coast of Haiti in an attempt to secure payment of debts owed to Germany. Haiti defaulted to several foreign powers during this period, and the deployment of naval ships was a common response. Coded not territory because Germany and Haiti were not disputing territory, and this was a debt issue.

RIVNOTES: 
RIV10167 combines MID1632, MID1648, MID95, and MID2235 even though they did not meet temporal density criteria, All the disputes, however, involved the same issue-Haitan default or German loans. 

Rivalry from riv30 eliminated in riv500 because disputes have been incorporated in other rivalries:

NARRATIVE-CR:
The German-Haiti rivalry is similar to the rivalry between Haiti and the other major powers in that the rivalry existed in large part due to Haitian domestic instability. This instability caused Haiti to fall short in being able to repay its foreign loans to Germany along with France and the UK. Because of the possibility of defaulting, Germany along with the others pressed claims that would allow them to collect on their loans by controlling Haitian customshouses. The instability also threatened German citizens and consequently brought in the threat of German intervention for those two reasons. Also worthy of note is that the rivarly took place between 1872 and 1911 during the high period of German-US imperial competition in Latin America, when Germany challenged US claims under the Monroe Doctrine. Great Britain, Italy, Germany and the United States in July 1911 suggested in a Joint Note a procedure in which to settle disputing claims by these parties against Haiti. Haiti refused to accept the suggestions which prompted foreign naval forces to enter Haitian waters. On July 26, 1911 Germany sent its naval cruiser *Bremen* from Montreal to Port-au-Prince in order to protect its interests in the midst of a revolution. German marines from the *Bremen* landed at Port-au-Prince to help maintain order on August 3, 1911 (MID2234). The rivalry effectively ends in 1914 when the US marines land in Haiti, with US occupation occuring the following year until 1934. The US occupation allows the other great powers to resolve their claims with regard to their earlier loans to Haiti. The last mid in 1941 is merely a declaration of war against Germany (MID3513) and does not merit consideration as part of the earlier rivalry.
