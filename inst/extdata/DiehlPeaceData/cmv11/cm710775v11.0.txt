NARRATIVE-CM:
Burma and China disputed their border after Burma formally achieved independence from Britain on January 4, 1948. Burma recognized the *People's Republic of China *(PRC) on December 18, 1949. Some 16,000 Chinese nationalist (*Kuomintang*) troops commanded by General Li Mi fled to Burmese territory beginning in December 1949. Some 200 Chinese troops entered Burmese territory in July 1953. Burmese troops and Chinese troops clashed near the border on November 20, 1955, resulting in the deaths of one Burmese soldier and one Chinese soldier. Some 1,500 Chinese troops seized 1,000 square miles of territory in northern Burma in July 1956. China agreed to withdraw its troops from Burmese territory on October 2, 1956, and Chinese troops completed their withdrawal from Burmese territory on December 12, 1956. The Burmese government issued a claim to dispute border territory on February 4, 1957, and the Chinese government issued a counter-claim to the disputed territory on July 26, 1957. Chinese troops entered Burmese territory on several occassions between May and September 1959. Burmese and Chinese representatives signed a non-aggression agreement in Beijing on January 28, 1960. Prime Minister Chou En-lai of China held negotiations with Prime Minister U Nu of Burma in Rangoon on April 15-19, 1960. Burmese and Chinese representatives signed the *Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty* in Peking on October 1, 1960, and instruments of ratification were exchanged in Rangoon on January 4, 1961. Burmese rioted against ethnic-Chinese in Rangoon on June 22-29, 1967, resulting in the death of some 50 ethnic-Chinese. China protested against the riots on June 28, 1967. China suspended economic assistance to Burma on July 7, 1967, and China withdrew 412 technicians from Burma on October 31, 1967. China resumed economic assistance to Burma on October 7, 1971.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Greg Dixon entry: 
Chinese and Burmese troops clashed along the disputed border between Burma and the PRC in a series of incidents from 1949 to 1959. On January 28, 1960, Burma and the PRC signed a treaty demarcating the mutual border. The treaty signed in 1960 appears to have resolved the core issues of the rivalry between the PRC and Burma. The territorial questions dominated the militarized disputes that took place following Burmese independence and the flight of Kuomintang troops to Burmese soil. While a militarized dispute does occur in 1967, this is related to rioting and general disorder in Burma and not due to issues regarding territory relevant to the rivalry. 

Jim Klein entry: 
The rivalry between Burma/Myanmar and China centers around territory as the borders between Burma and China were ill defined in the Burmese post independence period. Additionally, the initial hostilities were related in part to the presence of Chinese Kuomintang exiles on Burmese territory after their defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949. 

On 5 January 1948, Burma gained its independence from the UK. Three days later, nationalist China (KMT) that was in the final stages of a civil war claimed 40,000 square miles of territory. Between 10,000 and 12,000 Kuomintang troops attempted to establish a base there to be used in future operations against the PRC. The Burmese attempted to suppress the KMT troops in the area as they were aiding the ongoing Karen insurgency within Burma. In 1954, an airlift of the KMT army took place, removing most of the KMT forces from northern Burma. 

From May to September 1956 MID605 takes place. PRC armed forces occupied a relatively small area of about 1,000 square miles in a very remote and sparsely populated area that the Peking government claimed belonged to it. Previous border incursions to pursue KMT troops had been commonplace but after protests from the Rangoon, the PLA refused to evacuate. 

Following this dispute, the two governments suspended most of their activities in the disputed border regions pending a negotiated settlement of the border. Minor incidents occurred however due in part to remnants of the KMT exiles and other dissident tribesmen operating in Burmese territory. These groups would periodically harass Chinese territory. Chinese troops raided Burma on several occasions between May and September of 1959 MID1708 allegedly in pursuit of parties pillaging China's Yunnan Province. 

China and Burma signed a friendship treaty in 1960 that resolved some of the lingering territorial disputes. Tribal groups (Kachins and the Shans) that lived along the border resisted government efforts to absorb them by both the PRC and Burma. 

From January to November of 1969 MID352 occurs. Burma launched a military campaign to assert control over the Kachins and the Shans along the Sino-Burmese border. At the time, Chinese road construction near the border was also straining relations. China provided military assistance to some of the tribes. From May until October 1969 Burmese units occasionally clashed with Chinese troops operating within Burma. One negotiation attempt was made and failed. 

The rivalry between China and Burma eventually lapsed for a number of reasons. First, Burma has been plagued by internal violence ever since independence in 1948. After the border dispute with China in 1969 Burma refocused it attention on this guerrilla insurgency taking place internally. 

There were also domestic concerns for the Chinese. The PRC was embroiled in the Cultural Revolution from 1966 through 1977. The Cultural Revolution involved a mass mobilization of urban Chinese youth inaugurated by Mao Zedong, attempting to prevent development of a bureaucratized Soviet style of communism. Mao closed schools and encouraged students to join Red Guard units, which persecuted Chinese teachers and intellectuals and enforced Mao's cult of personality. The movement for criticism of party officials, intellectuals, and `bourgeois values' turned violent, and the Red Guard split into factions. Many people died in the ensuing purges. In 1969, the PLA took steps to forcibly restore order in many provinces. Lin Piao, commander of the armed forces, came under heavy criticism for the Cultural Revolution from Moderates such as Chou En-lai. Lin plotted to kill Mao but his plot was discovered. He tried to escape but his plane `crashed' while fleeing to Mongolia in 1971. In 1976, both Mao and Chou died. Hua Kuo-feng and Deng Xiao-p'ing were resurrected and brought to high positions of power. The Cultural Revolution also caused economic disruption; industrial production dropped by 12% from 1966 to 1968. It is reported that as many as 3 million people may have died in the great upheaval. 

Internationally, the Chinese were involved in an ideological rift with the USSR that boiled over in 1969. From March until August of 1969, the USSR and the PRC fought a brief conflict over an island in the Ussuri River. This river forms the border between China and the USSR in Manchuria. Sino-American detente at the time also increased Soviet suspicions of the PRC that intensified hostilities between them. 

Regionally, the Vietnam War was also a potential distraction for the PRC from the late 1960s until its end in 1975. The PRC supported the North Vietnamese with both weapons and up to 170,000 troops. Though the Chinese backed the North Vietnamese during the their war with the US and South Vietnam, the Chinese and Vietnam were traditional enemies. In 1979, this rivalry erupted in open hostility as 75,000 Chinese troops invaded Vietnam. The two fought on for three years. 

In sum, the domestic insurgency in Burma, the Cultural Revolution in the PRC and the international issues with the USSR and Vietnam provided enough distractions for both states to allow the rivalry to lapse. 

In 1971, relations between Burma and China improved as President Ne Win paid a `friendly and informal' visit to Peking. In October of 1975 President Ne Win visited Peking. During the visit the PRC and Burma released a joint statement saying that each side `undertook not to carry out acts of aggression against one another.' On July 13, 1979, Chinese premier Hua Guofend and Burmese Prime Minister U Maung Maung Kha signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement. On July 14, 1980, the governments of the PRC and Burma signed a protocol as a follow up to the agreement singed in 1979. Under the protocol, China helped Burma build eight projects including a highway across the Rangoon River. Another agreement on technical and economic assistance between the PRC and Burma was signed on 6/24/1984. 

After the September 1988 military crackdown on a democracy movement in Burma, most other foreign assistance was cut off to the country. Since the 1988 crackdown, China has been Burma's major ally. China has supplied Burma with economic aid and has been its supplier of military equipment. In January of 1997 China and Burma/Myanmar signed a military agreement to strengthen ties between the two governments. 

Greg Dixon and I have a different read on the rivalry between China and Burma. I argue that the MIDs constitute a rivalry for the following reasons. 

1. MID605 in 1956 is about two issues 1. unclear borders and 2. the
presence of KMT forces in Burma that PRC troops pursue.
2. MID1708 in 1959 is about the presence of lingering elements of the KMT
in Burma and dissident Shan and Kachin tribesman in the border region. PRC
troops pursue both of these groups as they make periodic raids on Chinese
territory.
3. MID352 in 1969 is about the Shan and Kachin tribal groups that straddle the border. Burma wants to control them and so does China.

So from this I also see that:

MID605 and MID352 have the unclear border issue in common
MID605 and MID1708 have the KMT troops in Burma with PRC troops violating
Burmese sovereignty in common.
MID352 and MID1708 also have the question of these border area tribal groups.
In MID1708 the tribal dissidents are described as harassing Chinese
territory.

Burma was the first nation outside of the Communist states to recognize the Communist government of China in December 1949. On September 19, 1950, China's ambassador to Burma made a pledge to strive for friendly relations. Nationalist Chinese guerillas used Burma as a launching pad for action against Communist China. The Burmese government, given its friendly relations with Communist China tried to stop the actions of these guerillas.

Some 1,500 Chinese troops seized 1,000 square miles of territory in northern Burma in July 1956. China agreed to withdraw its troops from Burmese territory on October 2, 1956, and Chinese troops completed their withdrawal from Burmese territory on December 12, 1956. The Burmese government issued a claim to dispute border territory on February 4, 1957, and the Chinese government issued a counter-claim to the disputed territory on July 26, 1957. Chinese troops entered Burmese territory on several occassions between May and September 1959. Burmese and Chinese representatives signed a non-aggression agreement in Beijing on January 28, 1960. Prime Minister Chou En-lai of China held negotiations with Prime Minister U Nu of Burma in Rangoon on April 15-19, 1960. Burmese and Chinese representatives signed the *Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty* in Peking on October 1, 1960, and instruments of ratification were exchanged in Rangoon on January 4, 1961. Burmese rioted against ethnic-Chinese in Rangoon on June 22-29, 1967, resulting in the death of some 50 ethnic-Chinese. China protested against the riots on June 28, 1967. China suspended economic assistance to Burma on July 7, 1967, and China withdrew 412 technicians from Burma on October 31, 1967. The last MID of RIV, MID352 ended on November 7, 1969.

In 1960 the two countries amicably demarcated their 1,300-mile border, and the next year China extended a large interest-free loan to Burma. Relations worsened, however, during Chairman Mao Tse-Tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in China, and Peking gave aid to the Burmese Communist guerrillas. In July 1967, Chinese and Burmese in Rangoon clashed in street riots after Chinese students refused orders from their Burmese teachers to remove their Mao badges. Both sides recalled their ambassadors and projects undertaken from the 1961 loans were suspended. Radio Peking began a barrage of attacks on Burmese leaders. Relations deteriorated further in 1968 when Burmese Communist rebels began striking at government troops in attacks launched from sanctuaries on the Chinese side of the border. A visit to Peking in August 1971 by Ne Win, Burma's top leader, eased tensions. Ambassadors returned to their posts, projects were resumed, new Chinese loans were offered, the Peking's radio attacks ceased and the Burma Communist Party headquarters was moved from Peking to Pang-Sang, a Communist stronghold in northeast Burma. However, the Burmese party has remained a problem that frequent high-level visits have failed to resolve. Maoist China, in a policy which also soured relations with Indonesia, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations, continued to insist that formal diplomatic relations could be maintained even though China's Communist Party aided other Communist insurgencies. By 1972, the Burmese party, after gradually taking over villages along the Chinese border, had an estimated 6,000 rebels in six northeastern divisions. The party grew to more than 20,000 by 1980, becoming the strongest and best-equipped of several rebel groups fighting the government in Rangoon. From the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, China sent advisers, money, weapons and other supplies to the insurgency. But this aid is believed to have been sharply reduced in the late 1970s after Deng Xiaoping took over the leadership in Peking and set out to improve relations with Southeast Asian nations by showing that China no longer sustained anti-government movements. Diplomats in Rangoon speculated that China helped set up secret peace talks between the Burmese party and the government in 1980. 

On February 10, 1977, Burmese newspapers carried editorials and articles to warmly welcome the friendly visit to Burma by Vice-Chairman Teng Ying-Chao of the standing committee of the Chinese People's National Congress. They point out that the visit will contribute to the further development of the friendship between Burma and China and the people of the two countries. They also carried articles in memory of the tremendous exploits made by Premier Chou En-Lai to the development of the friendship between Burma and China.

In 1978 Deng Xiaoping had visited Burma in China's first major post-"gang of four" effort to mend relations with Burma. Some 50,000 persons greeted him at the Airport in Rangoon. This was indeed significant because a strong anti-Chinese sentiment has long existed in Burma, and sometimes displayed itself in violent anti-Chinese riots. But the warmth of that greeting quickly wore off. Strong disagreement, apparently centering on Deng's refusal to give Ne Win the guarantees he wanted, led to canceling of a joint holiday retreat. Earlier this month China's prime minister, Zhao Ziyang, also visited Burma. This time the reception was correct but hardy warm. According to some reports the Burmese communists have been quieter in the last few months. But Burma, in fact, has a difficult dilemma on its hands. It can protest China's involvement with guerrillas on its borders by growing friendliness with Vietnam-or even more drastically with China's major rival, the Soviet Union. But as one diplomat is quoted as saying, "If China felt Burma was getting too close to Vietnam or even remotely to the Soviet Union, it would step up its involvement with Burma's communists.' That could be a very serious problem for a country already nearly torn apart by ethnic and tribal rebellions.

The Chinese leadership is using pro-China terrorist organizations in Burma to apply pressure on the Burmese government, state-run Burmese newspapers alleged on February 15, 1979. For example, right after Deng Xiaoping concluded his visit to Burma in 1978, pro-China in Burma elements promptly launched a fierce offensive. Burmese papers point out: Because Burma has refused to submit to Peking's control, the Chinese leadership is taking counter-measures. In fact, the Chinese leadership is inciting and supporting pro-China sabotage organizations in all South-East Asian countries. Despite these countries' protests, the Chinese leadership openly states that it is not prepared to stop this sabotage.

On July 14, 1979, Burma's newspapers carried editorials praising the current visit to China by Burmese Prime Minister U Maung Maung Kha. "The Working People's Daily" said: "The friendly visit to China by Prime Minister U Maung Maung Kha will further strengthen and consolidate the Paukphaw-like friendship between Burma and China." He said that "Burma and China are countries adhering to the principles of peaceful coexistence. under these principles, the two countries have maintained good-neighborly relations and they are making great efforts to enhance this friendship."

According to a report from Rangoon dated July 24, 1979, it has been learnt that there is a threat of a new offensive to be launched by insurgents under Peking's influence in the border area. Therefore, the Burmese Government is making preparations for counter measures against the insurgents. The situation remains tense in these areas, where Gen Kyaw Htin, Burmese Defense Minister, made an inspection tour. Mass rallies and demonstrations are being held in the Shan and Kachin States to denounce the insurgents who carry out subversive acts under Peking's orders. Meanwhile, thousands of young men have joined the people's militia units to help the Burmese Government soldiers defeat the insurgents. An important point to note here is that these incidents are happening at a time when the Burmese Premier, U Maung Maung Kha, is on a visit to Peking. This is not the first time this has happened. In the last few years, Burmese and Chinese leaders have exchanged many visits. In 1977, U Ne Win, President of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma, visited Peking twice, while Chinese Vice-Premier, Deng Xiaoping, visited Rangoon. As is generally known, the Burmese Government tried to stop Peking from supporting the anti-Government forces inside Burma. But the Chinese leaders only pay lip-service, declaring many times that they are striving to develop good-neighborly relations with Burma. When Premier U Maung Maung Kha visited the PRC, the Chinese leaders gave similar assurances. But the fact is, whenever summit talks between Burma and China end, pro-Peking insurgents intensify their activities on the border. According to press reports, the insurgents are trained at special camps in China's Yunnan Province before they are sent back to Burma. The provincial leader of Yunnan himself is in charge of the insurgents operating in Burma, while Chinese military advisers lead the insurgents. It has also been learnt that a joint military command has been established to co-ordinate the military operations of the anti-Government gangs in Burma. To transport the war material needed by the insurgents, roads leading to the Sino-Burmese border were constructed in China. Meanwhile, the broadcasting station inside China has been transmitting programs which urge the Burmese people to take up arms to overthrow the Government. Commenting on the subversive activities by the insurgents, Botataung said that the insurgents were disrupting Burma's social and economic programs, destroying tractors, oil pipelines, rice stores, railways and bridges, plundering villages and mercilessly killing the people.

On September 24, 1979, as a result of increased activities against the Burmese government by rebels who allegedly follow Peking's orders and by insurgents who go by the name of the KIA [Kachin Independence Army], the situation in northern Burma has suddenly become tense. The objective of these rebel operations is to link up their forces, it has been learnt that fierce battles are raging in the areas bordering China. There can be no doubt that the current flare-up of rebel activities in Burma is linked to China's provocations against Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea-the main cause of tension in South-East Asia. The Peking leaders, who have no intention of letting up on their threats and blackmail against these countries, are seeking a new military base to continue their subversive activities in South-East Asia.

The Christian Science Monitor wrote on February 26, 1981, that under the one-party rule of President U Ne Win, Burma has continued to defy China's best-laid plans to win warm relations with southeast Asia. In Burma, China has been unable to overcome a residue of suspicion over Peking's support of local communist rebels, in this case the outlawed Burmese Communist Party. It is a sore point because similar issues lie just beneath the surface throughout Southeast Asia. Despite a multitude of diplomatic visits during the last two years, the mercurial Ne Win appears as suspicious as ever of Chinese intentions. One reason: According to some estimates the strength of communist guerrillas operating along the 1,300-mile Sino-Burmese border has doubled to some 20,000 in the last five-years. The rebels are reported to have fled back and forth into China for sanctuary. Chinese advisers are not operating with Burmese communists inside Burma as they did between 1968 and 1974, according to some reports from Rangoon. But another irritant has arisen. The rebels are reported to have better weapons since mid-1979, including heavy mortars, recoilless rifles and a variety of land mines. This has counteracted any goodwill brought when China stopped supplying money and food to Burmese communists in 1978. Another irritant has been reports that the Burmese communists have been allowing opium-growing in areas they control. The opium goes to Burma, Thailand, and on to the West. Leaders have been alarmed by drug use among their own youth and launched a program of control. All this might seem of little importance since Burma, a mountainous, landlocked, backward country of 32 million is isolated and relatively non-influential. But to other Southeast Asian countries Burma China relations can be a bellwether of just how far China is willing to trim its support for insurgents. Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and even China-oriented Thailand have concerns over Chinese backing of communist rebels. China maintains its right to conduct limited "party to party" relations with such rebels. Southeast Asian countries say that is a semantic cover for Chinese intervention in Southeast Asian affairs. In a recent Southeast Asian tour Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang said China would limit its support to overseas communist parties to moral support. China and Burma have, however, kept up a labored, sometimes acrimonious, if largely private dialogue. In October President Ne Win met Vice-Chairman Deng Xiaoping in Peking. He is said to have protested what he saw as China's tolerance of opium activities in areas controlled by Burma's Communist Party. As a signal of continuing disagreement, Burma later took a number of steps displeasing to China. Among them: de facto "de-recognition" of the Chinese-backed Pol Pot shadow guerrilla government in Cambodia and a friendlier attitude toward Vietnam. 

On November 30, 1983, U San Yu, president of the Socialist Republic of Burma, told the visiting Chinese state Councillor and Minister for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Chen Muhua that Burma places special emphasis on Sino-Burmese friendship. U San Yu pledged to further develop these friendly relations, the foundation of which was laid down by previous leaders of the two countries through their frequent reciprocal visits. U San Yu expressed thanks for the aid China has given to Burma and appreciated the economic progress China has made in recent years. Chen Muhua promised that China would further strengthen its economic co-operation with Burma. The Burmese president met with Chen Muhua after the latter's arrival on a five-day visit to Burma.

On September 28, 1984, Burma and China were moving to patch up differences that arose between them in the late 1960s over Chinese backing of Burmese Communist guerrillas. Observers here believe Peking set the stage for improving relations by deciding that formal diplomatic ties must take priority over links with the Burma Communist Party. The observers, who commented on condition that they not be identified, say it is evident China has curtailed military aid to the Burmese Communists because they have not launched a major military offensive since 1980 and are having to resort to opium trading to support themselves. The restoration of relations is expected to culminate with an exchange of presidential visits, with Burma's San Yu going to Peking in late October 1984 and China's Li Xiannian coming to Rangoon in January 1985. Since the end of 1983, a half-dozen Chinese delegations and an equal number of Burmese missions have crossed paths. China's trade and foreign economic relations minister, Chen Muhua, came to Rangoon in December. Burma's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Tun Tin, received a warm reception in Peking in June. Burma was the first Asian nation to recognize the Communist regime in China after its 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists, and relations were particularly good during the 1950s and early 1960s. The Burmese name for the Chinese is "Paukphaw," meaning "born friend" or "fraternal friend," and Chinese leaders referred to Sino-Burmese ties as the "Paukphaw relationship." In 1960 the two countries amicably demarcated their 1,300-mile border, and the next year China extended a large interest-free loan to Burma. Relations worsened, however, during Chairman Mao Tse-Tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution in China, and Peking gave aid to the Burmese Communist guerrillas. In July 1967, Chinese and Burmese in Rangoon clashed in street riots after Chinese students refused orders from their Burmese teachers to remove their Mao badges. Both sides recalled their ambassadors and projects undertaken from the 1961 loans were suspended. Radio Peking began a barrage of attacks on Burmese leaders. Relations deteriorated further in 1968 when Burmese Communist rebels began striking at government troops in attacks launched from sanctuaries on the Chinese side of the border. A visit to Peking in August 1971 by Ne Win, Burma's top leader, eased tensions. Ambassadors returned to their posts, projects were resumed, new Chinese loans were offered, the Peking's radio attacks ceased and the Burma Communist Party headquarters was moved from Peking to Pang-Sang, a Communist stronghold in northeast Burma. However, the Burmese party has remained a problem that frequent high-level visits have failed to resolve. Maoist China, in a policy which also soured relations with Indonesia, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian nations, continued to insist that formal diplomatic relations could be maintained even though China's Communist Party aided other Communist insurgencies. By 1972, the Burmese party, after gradually taking over villages along the Chinese border, had an estimated 6,000 rebels in six northeastern divisions. The party grew to more than 20,000 by 1980, becoming the strongest and best-equipped of several rebel groups fighting the government in Rangoon. From the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, China sent advisers, money, weapons and other supplies to the insurgency. But this aid is believed to have been sharply reduced in the late 1970s after Deng Xiaoping took over the leadership in Peking and set out to improve relations with Southeast Asian nations by showing that China no longer sustained anti-government movements. Diplomats in Rangoon speculated that China helped set up secret peace talks between the Burmese party and the government in 1980. Those talks failed when the Burmese Communists insisted that the government give official recognition to their party, its army and its occupied territory. To compensate for the loss of military support from China, the Burmese party has moved aggressively into the narcotics trade, cultivating opium and possibly even refining it into heroin, according to officials in Rangoon. They say that Peking's efforts to revive traditional close ties with Rangoon will eventually leave the Burmese Communists in the cold, with the result that their guerrillas will degenerate into armed smugglers like other ethnic groups who use political organizations as fronts for narcotics operations.

Chinese President Li Xiannian said on 29th October, 1984, that it was China's firm and unswerving policy to develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with Burma. He was speaking at a banquet he gave for Burmese President U San Yu and Mme San Yu in the Great Hall of the People. The Chinese President said, ''Through the joint efforts of the two sides, China and Burma will certainly create a new situation in their friendly co-operation and bring it to a new height, thus benefiting the people of the two countries and promoting peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world.'' In his reply, Burmese President San Yu said that the two countries had maintained friendly contacts throughout history. These traditional ties of friendship had been transformed into stronger bonds of paukphaw friendship after Burma had gained her independence and China had attained her liberation. Bilateral exchanges had also increased and broadened. Both Presidents mentioned the fact that the two countries had successfully solved a number of problems, including the boundary question, left over by history, through close friendship and co-operation. U San Yu called their border agreement a ''landmark of Burma-China friendship for generations to come''. The two leaders also spoke highly of the five principles of peaceful coexistence put forward by China and Burma 30 years before. Li spoke highly of the external and internal policies of the Burmese government and the achievements of the Burmese people in industrial and agricultural production. He said, ''Your country has safeguarded the principles of the UN Charter, upheld justice and opposed aggression, made efforts to develop friendly relations with all countries and strengthen its unity and co-operation with the neighboring countries and other Third World countries, thus winning acclaim from the international community.'' The Burmese President pointed out, ''Burma is a developing country. We are endeavoring to raise the living standard of our people according to our culture and traditions and in our own way. In these endeavors, we rely mainly on our own human, natural and material resources. On the other hand, we have also accepted some external assistance that have been extended in sincerity and that are in keeping with our needs and requirements for national development.''

The Chinese president Li Xiannian is scheduled to join his Burmese counterpart U San Yu in exploring new ways of expanding bilateral cooperation during his state visit to Burma from March 4 to 8, 1985. Observers describe this visit which coincides with the celebrations for the 35th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Burmese diplomatic relations as a "major event in the history of their relations." President Li is the second Chinese president to visit Burma. The late president Liu Shaoqi visited Burma in 1963 and 1966. Bilateral trade and economic cooperation are expected to loom large in Li's discussions with Burmese leaders, observers note. The annual volume of bilateral trade has averaged 30 million US dollars since a new trade agreement according each other most-favored-nation treatment was signed in 1971. The trade volume reached 35 million US dollars in 1983. China and Burma have cooperated in completing 11 engineering projects including a sugar refinery, a textile and a paper mill, a thermal power plant and a rubber balls factory in Burma in the spirit of equality and cooperation for the purpose of common prosperity. Engineers and technicians of the two countries are now building a stadium in Burma which can seat 10,000 spectators. Observers here believe that this kind of cooperation will be expanded through president Li's visit to Burma. Sino-Burmese friendship described as "paukphaw" kinship dates back more than 2,000 years, according to historical records. The two peoples have supported each other in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism in the past century and their traditional friendship has grown still further, observers say. Burma was one of the first to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China as well as the first to settle the boundary question with this country. The late premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma on nine occasions while chairman U Ne Win came to China 11 times. Such frequent contacts between top leaders are rare in the history of friendly relations between nations, observers say. Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang and Deng Yingchao have visited Burma. President U San Yu came to China in October 1984. Such exchanges of visits between the leaders of the two countries have contributed to the development of Sino-Burmese relations, observers say.

The Burmese Prime Minister U Tun Tin met a visiting Chinese delegation led by Zhu Kui, vice-governor of the Yunnan province, on August 5, 1988, and expressed the wish that economic cooperation between Burma and China, including border trade, could be further developed. The Burmese Prime Minister said that relations between Burma and China have been good and it is a "paukphaw" (kinship) friendly relationship. Zhu Kui is the first foreign visitor U Tun Tin has met since he was elected Burmese prime minister the previous month.

China will maintain trade with Burma despite a de facto Western economic boycott of that country since the military seized power to stop pro-democracy protests, Chinese Premier Li Peng said on November 15, 1988. Mr Li reaffirmed China's trade links with neighboring Burma whose aid has been halted by many Western nations and Japan since a military coup in September ended two months of mass protests for democracy. "China doesn't interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Trade relations exist between China and Burma and we will maintain them," he said.

Luo Gan, Secretary-General of China's State Council, and the Vice-Foreign Minister, Xu Dunxin, held talks respectively with Khin Nyunt, Secretary-General of the Burma State Law and Order Restoration Council and the Vice-Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw in Peking on 22nd August, 1991. China and Burma signed an agreement on economic cooperation in Peking on 23rd August, 1991. Li Lanqing, Chinese Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and D.O. Abel, Burma's Minister of Finance and Planning and Trade, signed the document. The Chinese President, Yang Shangkun, and Saw Maung attended the signing ceremony. Saw Maung invited Yang to visit Burma at a convenient time. Yang accepted the invitation with pleasure. The CCP General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, met Senior General Saw Maung, the SLORC chairman, on 23rd August, 1991, in Peking. Jiang Zemin said that the core of the five principles of peaceful co-existence was non-interference in each other's internal affairs and that the system practiced in a country was the concern of the people of that country, and no other nation should interfere. Jiang Zemin said it was important to both China and Burma that they develop a good-neighborly, friendly relationship based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence and that China attached great importance to the development of such ties. Saw Maung said his talks were successful and that no matter how the international situation changed the friendly relations between Burma and China would continue to grow on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence and added that these principles would last forever.

"The outside world has adopted the approach of isolating and boycotting" Burma, China's foreign minister told a press conference on April 23, 1992. "As Burma is our neighbor, we have to keep in contact." Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans recently criticized China, one of the few supporters of the hardline regime in Rangoon, for its policy towards Burma. Evans urged Chinese leaders to stop supplying arms to the Burmese regime, which he said had become "impossible to defend," he said. Qian said his country's cooperation with Burma was important in order to deal with frequent criminal activities, such as smuggling and drug trafficking, across their common border. He said China was "very concerned" by the situation in Burma, from where 200,000 Moslems have fled to Bangladesh in recent months, telling of atrocities by government troops. Some refugees have also crossed into China recently and he said Beijing had granted them temporary asylum. China was the first country to recognize Burma's military junta after it took power in a 1988 coup and is the country's main arms supplier.

China is helping to build a naval base on the Andaman Sea coast under a secret agreement with Burma, Kyodo News Service reported on 17th September 1992, citing diplomatic sources in Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the information, the agency said. The sources who claim anonymity said the base is under construction on an island at the mouth of the Bassein River, in southern Burma, across the channel from the Indian naval facilities on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Indian observers have reportedly confirmed an increase in the frequency of visits to the area by Chinese naval vessels since the beginning of the year, the agency said. According to the sources, in return for China's cooperation in constructing the base, Burma will give China precedence in the use of the base. China is also reportedly constructing a radar facility on Burma's Coco Islands, which lie immediately north of the Andaman Islands. In a later report, Kyodo said that Japan had asked Burma about the naval base but Burma ''had so far not confirmed or denied the rumor''.

Chinese Premier Li Peng left for Burma on December 26, 1994, for a three-day official visit that China says it hopes will encourage trade. Li was invited to Rangoon by his Burmese counterpart, Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration Council-SLORC-the military junta that has ruled Burma since 1988. An official Xinhua news agency described Li's trip as a ''goodwill visit'' and included excerpts in its report from Burma's newspapers welcoming the Chinese premier. The Chinese entourage includes State Councillor Li Guixian, Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong, Yunnan Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang and Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. But some dozen banner-waving Burmese students demonstrated against the premier's visit in front of China's Embassy in Bangkok. One of their banners accused the ruling council of killing Burmese people with ''arms from China.'' China was the first country to recognize the Burmese junta when it came to power after a 1988 coup that killed or imprisoned thousands of pro-democracy students. Some western diplomats say they believe Beijing is hoping its involvement with Burma will give it direct access to the Indian Ocean. ''If China has access, it would give Beijing a better basis for power projection,'' said one. China has denied allegations that it is trying to build a two-ocean blue-water navy that can operate far from home bases by using Burmese ports to carry out long-range operations. Other diplomats say political ties between the two countries have grown closer because Beijing and Rangoon face similar Western pressures regarding human rights issues. Trade between Burmaand Yunan, the southwestern Chinese province that shares a lengthy border with Burma, is flourishing. The 1,300-mile (2, 092-km) border has seen growing trade with China since Beijing ceased to support the Burmese Communist Party and ethnic groups in open revolt against the junta. Underscoring the economic boom, Hu Guocai, a senior Chinese trade official, said, ''Close geographical location, a long history of economic ties and the complementary economies-all these are advantageous elements for further development'' for trade. In an interview with the official China Daily, Hu, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation's Asian Affairs Department, said Burma's raw materials and mineral products are needed in China. China's equipment, machinery and electronics, light industry and textile products are popular in Burma's markets. Radios and television sets, virtually absent a decade ago, have poured into Burma along with clothing and canned food. Hu said China's trade with Burma last year amounted to $490 million, compared with $100 million in the early and mid-1980s. The border trade reached $294 million in 1993, he said. Experts say that with China's help, Burma is rapidly expanding and modernizing its armed forces. Most western countries have refused to sell arms to Burma so Beijing has become Rangoon's main source of weapons. Among the weapons China has sold to Burma are F-7 jet fighters, navy frigates, patrol boats, anti-aircraft guns, howitzers and large amounts of small arms and ammunition. There are reports that many of the weapons, including the jets, have been deployed against ethnic minority rebel armies along Burma's borders. The Chinese are also reportedly helping the Burmese junta build a radar station on Great Coco Island in the Andaman Sea.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Rangoon on December 14, 2001, underscores Beijing's desire to retain its position as the most influential foreign power in Burma, and remain one of its few allies. The official visit, a milestone for China-Burma relations, gives a much-needed boost to the international image of Burma's military regime. Jiang, who apart from signing economic and oil deals with Rangoon went on a recreational visit of the country, is the first Chinese president to visit Burma since the current regime came to power in 1988. Sino-Burmese relations have gained greater attention since the suppression of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising by Burma's military government. Since then, China has become a major arms supplier to Burma and the two countries have had closer ties. Because of these closer ties in recent years, China's induction this month into the World Trade Organization (WTO) also bodes well for Burma's lackluster economy. Sino-Burmese relations, however, have a history that dates back decades.

Senior Gen Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and Development Council of the Union of Burma, met with Li Lanqing, vice-premier of the Chinese State Council, who is on an official visit here, at the Yangon Pyithu Hluttaw (Parliamentary) building on 15 January, 2003. They had a conversation on bilateral relations and other issues of common concern in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Li Lanqing first conveyed to Chairman Than Shwe President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards and best wishes. Than Shwe expressed his thanks for this and asked Li Lanqing to convey to President Jiang his best wishes and sincere thanks for the warm reception and thoughtful arrangements for him during his visit to China. Li Lanqing congratulated Than Shwe on the complete success of his recent visit to China.

On August 18, 2003, senior Chinese officials say Beijing will strengthen ties to Burma. The move is in stark contrast to Western efforts to isolate Burma's military government over its continued detention of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Guo Boxiong, the vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission, said Beijing wants tighter relations with Burma. The announcement came on the second day of a visit to China by the second-in-command of Burma's military government, General Maung Aye.

State Council Premier Wen Jiabao held talks with Burmese Prime Minister Khin Nyunt at the Great Hall of the People on 12 July, 2004. Wen Jiabao said that China and Burma are friendly neighbors. In recent years, the momentum of the development of Sino-Burmese relations has been very good and the political, economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries has expanded continuously. Consolidating the traditional friendship and carrying out mutually beneficial cooperation at a deeper level are the common aspiration of the Chinese and Burmese people and are also the common goal of the two governments. Wen Jiabao said that the current international situation is complicated and turbulent. With this backdrop, it is very necessary to strengthen exchanges between Chinese and Burmese leaders. Besides, the two countries should cooperate closely in the United Nations and other international organizations, and exchange views and coordinate positions on bilateral relations and issues of common concern at any time. Wen Jiabao spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation between China and Burma in banning drugs, and hoped both sides will further increase their efforts in anti-drugs cooperation, establish a border management and cooperation mechanism between the two countries, and sternly crack down on transnational crimes. Regarding Sino-Burmese trade and economic relations, Wen Jiabao pointed out that China will continue to provide Burma with economic aid within its power with the final goal of increasing Burma's own capability for development. He suggested both sides should further expand the scale of bilateral trade, properly select and implement prioritized cooperation projects, and strengthen the exchange of experience in economic construction. During the talks, Wen Jiabao expressed appreciation for the Burmese government in pursuing the one-China policy over a long time.

On February 17, 2006, Burma's prime minister was in China seeking support for his isolated country from one of its few allies. Western nations have imposed sanctions on the country because of its human rights abuses, but Beijing continues to support the government in Rangoon. Experts say Burmese Prime Minister Soe Win is in Beijing seeking assurances of continued Chinese diplomatic and economic support for Burma's beleaguered military government. Mohan Malik is a specialist on China's Asian relations at the Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. He says Chinese support is crucial to Burma's military rulers. "The military government remains heavily dependent on China for economic, military, and diplomatic support. China has a veto in the U.N. Security Council," said Malik. "So, the military junta in Rangoon counts on Beijing to bail it out in case the U.N. Security Council decides to take some action against Burma." China has refused to support sanctions against Burma, and the two countries are due to sign several trade and economic agreements during the visit. Speaking at a regular press briefing Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, repeated China's position that questions about human rights concerns are Burma's "internal affair." "China believes that things that happen in Burma are the domestic affairs of Burma itself. China has the principle of non-interference of other countries' internal affairs. We believe the issues in Burma should be solved through negotiation between the government and the people." The United States and the European Union have already placed their own sanctions on Burma. U.S. officials last week said they are contemplating introducing a U.N. resolution regarding human rights abuses in Burma. The current military government seized power in 1988 after violently suppressing pro-democracy demonstrations. It allowed a general election in 1990, but then refused to recognize the results after a landslide victory by the National League for Democracy, the party of opposition leader Aung San Sun Kyi.
