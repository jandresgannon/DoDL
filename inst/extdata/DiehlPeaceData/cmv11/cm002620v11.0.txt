TERRMID-NOTES: MID2950 from cm narrative, Libya shot at US military aircraft and intercepted US aircraft on a separate occasion in March 1973. Qaddafi had tensions with the US at the time and was regarded as hostile by the US due to Libya's nationalization of US oil companies and his claim to be a pan-Arab leader, which threatened a united region against the US and Western Powers. Coded not territory because the US and Libya did not have a territorial dispute and this was a product of political tensions, not a claim.

The US protested. Coded not third party link to territory because the Libyan attack on Sudan was not a territorial claim, and the two countries did not dispute territory.

Coded not third party link to territory because although the US was drawn into this dispute on behalf of Sudan, this was not a territorial dispute between Libya and Sudan, but was rather an issue of political support.

Britain and the US referred the matter to the UN Security Council after Libya refused the extradition request. The UN Security Council approved a resolution on January 21, 1992, which urged Libya to fully cooperate with US and British authorities on the Lockerbie bombing. Libya filed a case against the US and Britain with the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on March 3, 1992, which requested that the ICJ call upon the US and Britain to "resolve the matter within the framework of international law" that did not require Libya to extradite its nationals to countries with which it did not have extradition agreements. LAS foreign ministers established a seven-member conciliation commission (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Syria) on March 22, 1992.

The last MID of RIV83, MID4195 ended on April 2, 1996. From 1996 to early 2003, relations between Libya and the US remain tense; however, the two countries do not experience a dispute during this period. Staring in the summer of 2003 relations between these two countries begin to improve markedly and continue to do so until 2006 when full diplomatic relations are restored. On August 27, 1998, the UN Security Council approved a proposal to hold the trial of the two Libyan suspects of the bombing before a Scottish court in the Netherlands.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Libya formally achieved its independence from Italy on December 24, 1951. Libya and the United States signed an agreement on September 9, 1954, which provided for the continuation of US military base leasing in Libya. On March 16, 1964, the Libyan parliament voted to require the government to negotiate the withdrawal of US military personnel from the country. The Libyan government formally requested that the US immediately withdraw its remaining troops from Libyan military bases in June 1967. The US completed its withdrawal from Wheeler Air Force Base near Tripoli on June 11, 1970. During this period as well, Libyan leader Qaddafi began to exert himself as a kind of self-proclaimed leader of the Arab world. He started the nationalization of United States oil companies. On the eve of President Nixon's trip to the Mediterranean in late September 1970, he indicated that while military action was not planned, at some point there may be no diplomacy for the military to back up. This marks some rising tensions between the two countries, which were based upon Qaddafi's support for terrorist actions against the West and his self-proclaimed status as the leader of the Arab world, and possibly a pan-Arab nation.

Libyan military aircraft shot at a US military aircraft over the Mediterranean on March 21, 1973, and Libyan military aircraft intercepted several US military aircraft from the US Sixth Fleet over the Mediterranean on March 30, 1973. This is MID2950.

Libya nationalized four US oil companies in the country on June 11, 1973 and February 11, 1974. Libya claimed the Gulf of Sidra as its territorial waters on October 9, 1973. The US refused to recognize the Gulf of Sidra as Libyan territorial waters. Libya ended oil exports to the US on October 19, 1973, as a result of US support of Israel during the Arab-Israeli conflict. Libya ended its oil embargo against the US on December 31, 1974. 

I could find no information on the one-day MID3021. Libyan military aircraft shot at and missed a US reconnaissance aircraft on September 16, 1980. Secretary of State Al Haig of the US accused Libya of supporting terrorist groups on March 18, 1981. The US closed the Libyan diplomatic mission in Washington DC on May 6, 1981, and the US State Department called on Americans residing in Libya to leave the country on December 10, 1981. US military aircraft from the USS *Nimitz* shot down two Libyan military aircraft near the Libyan coast on August 19, 1981. This is designated as MID3099 or MID3065, as they both overlap. Libya accused the US of a "provocative terrorist act" on August 20, 1981. 

MID3098 occurred in November 1981, when Libya committed air raids against Sudan as part of its continued effort to undermine governments in the region whom Qaddafi viewed as pro-Western.

US military aircraft intercepted a Libyan plane over the Aegean Sea on January 31, 1982, and Libya protested the incident to the US on February 4, 1982. This is MID2978. President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions (ban on crude oil imports) against Libya on March 10, 1982. This is MID3088.

Two Libyan MiGs were chased away from the USS Nimitz on February 18, 1983 by F-14 fighters from that ship. This was MID3072.

US military aircraft intercepted two Libyan MiG-23 planes over the Mediterranean on June 30, 1983, and US military aircraft intercepted two Libyan planes over the Gulf of Sirte on August 2, 1983, classified as MID3634. 

MID3051 occurred when the US deployed two AWACS surveillance planes over Sudan after Libya had bombed that country in March 1984.

The US expanded economic sanctions against Libyan on November 15, 1985 to include a ban on the import of refined petroleum products. The US blamed Libya for terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna on December 27, 1985, which had resulted in the deaths of 20 individuals. Some 2,000 Soviet military advisors (SAM-5 anti-aircraft missiles) were deployed in Libya on December 31, 1985. This was MID3620.

US naval ships were deployed near the Libyan coast on January 3, 1986, and Colonel Muammar Qaddafi placed Libyan forces on full alert on January 4, 1986, beginning MID3636. The US imposed economic sanctions (trade embargo) against Libya on January 7, 1986, and froze Libyan assets in the US on January 8, 1986. Libya placed its navy and airforce on total alert on January 24, 1986. The OAU expressed support for Libya on February 27, 1986. On March 2, 1986, Colonel Qaddafi threatened to fire missiles against US ships violating its territorial waters. Libyan troops fired six SAM-2 and SAM-5 missiles at US aircraft on maneuvers in the Gulf of Sidra on March 24, 1986. The US retaliated by firing missiles at Libyan ships and ground installations on March 25, 1986, resulting in the deaths of some 72 individuals. A terrorist bombed killed two individuals in West Berlin on April 5, 1986 (a third individual died of wounds on June 7, 1986), and the US accused Libya on involvement in the terrorist bombing. US military bombers attacked Libyan military and suspected terrorist sites in Libya on April 15, 1986, resulting in the deaths of some 130 Libyans and two US military personnel. 

An American passenger airplane exploded as a result of a bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988, resulting in the deaths of 270 individuals, classified as MID2775. The US imposed economic sanctions against Libya on December 28, 1988. US military aircraft from the US Sixth Fleet shot down two Libyan military aircraft over the Mediterranean Sea on January 4, 1989. On November 13, 1991, two Libyan nationals, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima, were indicted in a US District Court for involvement in the Lockerbie bombing, and the US requested that Libya extradite the men for trial in the US. Libya filed a case against the US and Britain with the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on March 3, 1992, which requested that the ICJ call upon the US and Britain to "resolve the matter within the framework of international law" that did not require Libya to extradite its nationals to countries with which it did not have extradition agreements. The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on March 31, 1992, which imposed economic sanctions (flight embargo) and military sanctions (arms embargo) against Libya. The sanctions went into effect on April 15, 1992. The ICJ issued a ruling against Libya on April 14, 1992. On August 27, 1998, the UN Security Council approved a proposal to hold the trial of the two Libyan suspects of the bombing before a Scottish court in the Netherlands. The UN Security Council suspended economic and military sanctions against Libya after Libya surrendered the suspects to authorities in the Netherlands on April 5, 1999. 

On April 2, 1996, the United States accused Libya of building the world's largest chemical weapons production plant, and pressured it to stop these efforts. This is MID4195. It is a good indication that tensions between the two countries have not ended. Col. Qaddafi is still in charge of Libya at the time of this narrative, and while his involvement in overt terrorist activities toward the United States has lessened over the past decade or so, it would be premature to designate this rivalry as terminated.

The last MID of RIV83, MID4195 ended on April 2, 1996. From 1996 to early 2003, relations between Libya and the US remain tense; however, the two countries do not experience a dispute during this period. Staring in the summer of 2003 relations between these two countries begin to improve markedly and continue to do so until 2006 when full diplomatic relations are restored.

Following Libya's independence in 1951, the United States and Libya were on amicable terms. They signed an agreement in 1954 to continue US military base leasing rights. By the 1960s, the presence of US bases in Libya, and foreign military bases in the Middle East more generally, became a controverial issues for many leaders and citizens. Negotiations begin in the late 1960s to remove US bases from Libya. Following Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi's coup in 1969, the US withdrew all troops in 1970. The rivalry between the two countries began that same year. The first MID of RIV83, MID2950 started on March 21, 1973.

On August 15, 2003, in a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Libya accepted full responsibility for the Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988 and agreed to pay compensation to the families of the victims. At this time, the U.S. agreed, once the payments were made by Libya to the families, to not oppose the lifting of UN sanctions on Libya; the US, however, was not ready at this time to alter bilateral relations with Libya. On December 3, 2003, Libya agreed to `disclose and dismantle' all weapons of mass destruction. In addition, Libya agreed to the unconditional admittance of international inspectors. On February 26, 2004 the United States government, in response to Libya's abandonment of a WMD program and allowing international inspectors, lifted travel restrictions to Libya for US citizens, open the door for US business interests involved in Libya pre-sanctions to enter negotiations with Libya regarding reentry into the Libyan market, and to allow the opening of a Libya Interest Section in Washington. At this time, the US government suggested that future improvements, including removal of Libya from the list of state sponsors of terror, would be tied to further actions by the Libyan government to improve their international reputation. 

On April 23, 2004 the US announced enhanced economic relations with Libya that included termination of the portion of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act that pertained to trade with Libya. Termination of the sanctions act allowed the resumption of `most commercial activities, financial transactions, and investment.' Because Libya is still, at this time, listed as a state sponsor of terror, limits on the export to Libya of technology with dual-uses remain in place. On May 13th 2004 Libya announced that it would immediately cease military dealings with any state that are considered a risk for proliferation and would not sell missiles or missile technology to countries not a part of the missile technology control regime. On September 20, 2004 President G. W. Bush signed an Executive Order terminating Executive Orders 12543, 12544, 12801, 12538; all of these orders relate to sanctions and policies in regard to relations with Libya.

On May 15th 2006 the US announced the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Libya. In addition, Libya was officially removed from the list of state sponsors of terror. The US government suggests that this announcement opens the door for greater bilateral relations between the two states, including protection of human rights and the promotion of freedom of speech within Libya. Nevertheless, relations were again severely strained by the outbreak of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, in which Gaddafi attempted to crush first protests, and then an armed rebellion against his rule. The U.S. government cut ties with the Gaddafi regime, and enacted sanctions against senior regime members. The US military played an instrumental role in the initial stage of the intervention, suppressing Libyan air defenses and coordinating international forces in the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya,[15][16] before handing command responsibility to NATO and taking a supporting role in the campaign of air strikes against pro-Gaddafi forces.

The death of Muammar Gaddafi on October 20 , 2011 marked the end of Libyan Civil War. Since then the United States has been working on developing relations with new Libyan government. source(http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-gadhafi-death-marks-end-of-long-and-painful-chapter/) The US took longer than other leading NTC allies to formally recognise the council as Libya's legitimate authority, but it did so on July 15, 2011 and it granted accreditation to Ali Aujali as the Libyan Ambassador to the United States on August 15.[19] Later that month, the US led an effort at the United Nations to repeal parts of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 in order to allow unfrozen Libyan assets to be transferred to the interim government.[20] When the civil war came to an end in October, US President Barack Obama pledged to work with the new Libyan government as a partner, and said the United States was "committed to the Libyan people".
