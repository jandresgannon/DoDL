CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID4273 from cm narrative, this MID involves Iraq's refusal to comply with UN weapons inspectors and enforcement of the no-fly zone. Iraq expelled weapons inspectors and repeatedly violated the no-fly zone. The US and UK repeatedly threatened Iraq and eventually bombed them over a four day period. UAE was part of a coalition of states that participated in a show of force to deter Iraq from further violations. Coded civil war MID because this MID involved violation and enforcement of the no-fly zone over Iraq. The no-fly zone was put in place to prevent Saddam Hussein from attacking militarized rebels in Kurdistan.

The dispute began (10/7/1997) because of increasing intransigence by Iraq. Iraq increased the frequency with which it violated the no-fly zones and threatened to refuse to allow Americans on the UN inspections team. Most importantly, Iraq threatened to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane. The United States and the United Kingdom responded by threatening military action if Iraq attempted to shoot down an American plane. Kuwait responded to the heightened tension between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq by putting its troops on alert. On 11/13/1997, Iraq carried out its threat to expel US Arms inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom began preparing for punitive air strikes against Iraq if Iraq did not begin to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. On 11/23/1997, Iraq allowed weapons inspectors to reenter, but it continued to hamper UN investigations, restricting access to selected sites. On 1/17/1998, Iraq again threatened to expel weapons inspectors, requesting that economic sanctions against it be lifted. The United States reiterated its threat to use force if Iraq did not allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected sites. The US and UK military buildup in the region continued and they announced that their forces were combat ready (2/7/1998). In MIDNovember, the United States reissued its threat to use force against Iraq if it did not unconditionally comply with UN weapons inspectors. All remaining weapons inspectors withdrew in response to the United States' warning. Iraq capitulated on 11/15/1998, promising to comply with the UN inspection teams. The United States and the United Kingdom stated that if Iraq did not continue to comply, they would use force against it. On 12/10, Iraq ended cooperation with UN inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would attack Iraq without warning for breaking it promise of full cooperation. On 11/16, they began "Operation Desert Fox," a four-day bombing campaign against Iraq. Israel also put its military on alert, fearing that Iraq would attack it in retaliation for U.S. and British military actions against Iraq. Almost immediately after the American and British bombing campaign, Iraq stated that it would challenge the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq (11/1998; 1/3/1999). There were clashes on almost a daily basis between British and American planes patrolling the northern and southern no-fly zones and Iraqi military installations from December 1998 to October 2001. Although clashes between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq occurred almost continuously until October, Iraqi challenges to the no-fly zones escalated in August 2001 and were more frequent until mid-October. On 2/15/1999, Iraq threatened to attack Turkey if it continued to allow American planes to use its bases. On 2/2/1999, the United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would retaliate if fired upon, by bombing pre-determined targets in Iraq that were deemed threatening. The United States and the United Kingdom engaged in numerous retaliatory bombing campaigns on Iraqi targets through October (2001), as Iraq continued to threaten and fire upon American and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones. On 10/22/1999, 11 nations (USA, UK, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Greece, and Germany) participated in joint military exercises to demonstrate that an anti-Iraq coalition could still be formed. On 5/23/2001 and 8/24/2001, an Iraqi patrol crossed into Saudi territory and fired on a Saudi border patrol. Iraq acted in order to demonstrate its disapproval of Saudi aid to the United States. On 6/11/2001, Saudi Arabia seized a unused pipeline from Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi violations of Saudi borders. First day of dispute was on 2/12/2003 and last day of dispute was on 3/18/2003.
Over the course of 2002, US and UK planes bombed various Iraqi defense systems placed either in or near the US-imposed no-fly zones. During this time Iraq deployed ground forces to its border towns in a preemptive move against future US aggression. Beginning in March 2003, the US began deploying additional land, naval, and air forces to the the Middle East in a clear show of force and build-up to a future invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, just prior to the US-led invasion, several Middle Eastern countries deployed small numbers of troops to Kuwait in a symbolic show of defense for the neighbor of Iraq, which had been the historical target of Iraqi aggression. Later in March 2003, a US-led coalition, seeking to oust the regime of Saddam Hussein and dismantle alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, invaded Iraq and engaged in major combat operations, ultimately resulting in war, against the country that lasted until May 1, 2003. First day of dispute was on 2/22/2003 and last day of dispute was on 3/18/2003.

As was the case on several occasions after the end of the Gulf War, Iraq sent troops and/or took other hostile actions directed at Kuwait. During this dispute, sources say Iraq moved 50,000 or more troops close to the Kuwaiti border. Iraqi actions provoked a number of responses from members of the Gulf War coalition both to reinforce the border, and to signal Iraq that its action would not be tolerated. Coder: Ric Stoll. Date: 8/2/02. First day of dispute was on 10/15/1994 and last day of dispute was on 10/20/1994.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The Iraq/United Arab Emirate (UAE) rivalry beings with MID3957 the Persian Gulf War, started on August 2, 1990 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations Security Council immediately passed Resolution 660 condemning the invasion. The Arab League, on August 3rd, also called for Iraq's immediate withdrawal, including the UAE. Iraq's refusal to comply resulted in a coalition of forces launching an air and ground war starting in January of 1991, and ultimately led to Iraq being pushed out of Kuwait with hostilities ending on February 28th 1991 and the acceptance of Security Council Resolution 686 on March 3rd. 

MID4269 involves the response of several countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to lend support to the Kuwaiti army in response to the build-up of Iraqi forces near Kuwait's border. The UAE sent warships to Kuwait's territorial waters to stage joint exercises with the Kuwaiti and Bahraini military. UAE also sent several fighters to Kuwait to defend against a possible Iraqi attack. 

MID4273 again revolves around the violations by Iraq of the imposed no-fly zone. In addition, UAE was involved with Jordan, Kuwait, France, Germany, Egypt, British, U.S., Italy, Greek, and Dutch forces in a series of war games and joint training exercises designed to demonstrate Iraq's isolation from the rest of the Arab community and to improve the ability of the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East to work together in times of war.

PS-NARRATIVE:

19711202-19900801 0.5

The United Arab Emirates became independent on December 2, 1971. The discovery of extensive petroleum deposits in the 1960s prompted Iraq and other states to challenge the legitimacy of the UAE's ruling families. Throughout the 1980s, the UAE had striven with difficulty to maintain neutrality in the Iran-Iraq War. That conflict was also a source of internal UAE tension because Abu Dhabi tended to support Iraq while Dubai was more sympathetic to Iran. After the war ended in 1988, Iran appeared to single out the UAE for special and friendly attention. By 1992 the UAE was the Arab country with which Iran had the closest commercial relations.

A report released on April 11, 1983 suggested that the United Arab Emirates, among the smallest and most vulnerable of the Arab oil states, is playing both sides in the war between its Persian Gulf neighbors, Iran and Iraq. Abu Dhabi, the biggest and richest of the seven sheikdoms that make up the federation, has contributed to the billions in Arab aid to Iraq during the 2 1/2-year-old conflict, while Dubai, the second-biggest and richest member, has maintained a flourishing trade with Iran. Western diplomats say the United Arab Emirates, with a native population of 200,000 to 250,000 and a fledging army of only about 40,000 has little choice but to sit on the fence and hope the war will not spread. The old trading families of this city-state have both commercial and blood ties with their Iranian neighbors. Many are descended from the merchants who fled at the turn of the century from high customs duties in Persia, before it became known as Iran. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has complained of the Emirates' less than whole-hearted support for his country, but to no avail. Early in the conflict, the Emirates lent no support to his demands that the Iranians withdraw from three Arab-populated islands seized by the Shah of Iran two days before the British withdrew from the Persian Gulf sheikdoms in 1971. The islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa, are strategically located in the gulf at the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world's oil passes. Sharjah, one of the less-wealthy members of the federation, still shares with Iran half the revenue from an oilfield on Abu Moussa under an accommodation worked out before Iran took over the island. Dubai's trade with Iran has helped the Islamic republic weather the U.S. embargo imposed during the 444-day hostage crisis and the long war with Iraq. Most cargo to Iran is shipped on the diesel-powered versions of the old wooden ships called dhows that have been used in the Persian Gulf for centuries. Until the nationalizations in Iran and the outbreak of the war with Iraq in September 1980, Iran was the biggest market for Dubai's billion-dollar-a-year re-export trade in which consumer goods are imported to Dubai with a 1 percent tax and then re-exported. Iran's share of the market fell from 29.3 percent to 14 percent in 1981, and to 6 percent in the first nine months of 1982. But Bill Duff, a British financial adviser to the Dubai Customs and Excise Office, said Iran has eased restrictions on imports and most of the goods from Dubai are again sailing to Iran. Omar Arafat Dessi, an official in the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, said Iran also was increasingly tolerant of smuggling from Dubai. "It takes two months to import through the government of Iran," he said. "With a dhow merchant, you give him a call in Dubai and the goods are in your warehouse in Bandar Abbas two days later." The dhows could be seen recently being loaded with Japanese cars and trucks, appliances, glassware, tires, pumps, batteries, brake fluid and other hardware. One even had a school bus wedged onto its narrow bow. One 43-year-old Iranian dhow owner said he made the 35-hour trip to Bushehr, at the head of the gulf, once a month carrying Iranian workers and goods purchased in Dubai. One Western diplomat in Dubai interpreted the loosening of restrictions by Iran as a sign that the Islamic republic is moving away from its obsession with the war toward a return to more normal life.
Dubai's merchants hope the new trend will continue. "Saudi Arabia is a very important market for us and last year they imported a great deal from us," said Abdel-Wahab Galadari, 46, an Emirates citizen whose family came from the Iranian port of Lingah early in this century. "But in no way can you compare it with Iran. Despite the troubles in Iran, it is still our main market, then the (Indian) subcontinent, and then the Saudis." Dubai produces 360,000 barrels of oil daily, but its people are most proud of their commercial heritage. Galadari, one of three brothers reputed to have massed huge fortunes, recently built an apartment complex, which has an ice skating rink in the lobby. "We are business people in Dubai, and we have Persian blood and Arab blood," he said. "We deal with everyone, and have no bad blood with anyone."

Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a joint statement on August 7, 1984, stressed the need to halt the Iraq-Iran war and pledged continued support for efforts toward ending the devastating war, according to reports from Abu Dhabi. The joint press statement was issued in Abu Dhabi at the end of a visit made by Izzat Ibrahim, vice-president of Iraq's revolutionary command council, to the UAE. The UAE expressed deep understanding of Iraq's stand and said it will respond to all initiatives aimed at ending the war. The statement said the call for an end to the war was made during a meeting between Ibrahim and UAE president Shaikh Zayed at which they reviewed the developments of the Iraq-Iran war and matters of common interest. Ibrahim left Abu Dhabi for Muscat on August 7, 1984, after ending a one-day visit to the UAE, which followed his trip to Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. He delivered a similar message from the Iraqi president to heads of state of these countries.

Persian Gulf leaders met to form a unified defense strategy amid new reports of clashes in the Iran-Iraq war and fears their nations were vulnerable to Israeli bombing missions. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, opened a three-day meeting on November 4, 1985, in Muscat of their loose economic and military alliance called the Gulf Cooperation Council. The conference opened as Iran accused Iraq of dropping ''chemical bombs'' on a southern Iranian town, reviving a controversy over the outlawed weapons that have surfaced on several occasions during the 5-year-old Gulf war. Gulf Cooperation Council leaders meeting in Oman worried the war might spill over into their neighboring states. Chairman Sultan Qabous of Oman urged the leaders to ''reaffirm the council's role as a stabilizing factor in the region.'' Gulf officials said that at the top of the agenda was the development of a unified defense strategy with integrated air, naval and ground military forces and the creation of a rapid deployment force, to be called the ''Peninsula Shield Force.''

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) stands by Iraq against the recent biased anti-Iraqi campaign and supports all moves by Baghdad to protect its people and maintain its national security and territorial integrity, UAE information and culture minister Sheikh Ahmad bin Hamed said in a recent interview with Xinhua on April 17, 1990. "To accuse Iraq of trying to develop nuclear and chemical weapons is a scheme intended to deprive Iraq of modern technology," the minister said, adding that such media campaigns against Iraq would only enhance tension in the Middle East region. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein acknowledged early this month that his country has chemical weapons and will use them if Iraq is attacked. Some western countries have also accused Iraq of trying to develop nuclear arms, which Baghdad denied. Answering a question about the situation in the gulf region, sheikh bin Hamed warned that the situation there will remain grave so long as Iraq and Iran do not reach a comprehensive settlement to their conflict. He said that the latest developments regarding the Iran-Iraq issue, including the declaration by both Iraq and Iran that they were ready to resume peace negotiations under the supervision of UN secretary general Javier Perez de Cuellar, were positive signs. Sheikh bin Hamed pointed out that his country supports efforts which are intended to implement UN Security Council resolution 598 for reaching a comprehensive and lasting peace between the two gulf countries. Iran and Iraq halted their eight-year Gulf War in August 1988 under a UN-sponsored ceasefire. But peace talks held between the two sides since then have failed to achieve any substantial results.

Passenger ferry service from Bahrain to Iraq will begin on December 25, 1999, an expansion of a route that is seen as part of a gradual shift among Gulf Arab countries to ease Iraq's isolation. Naif Marine Services, based in the Emirates, has been running the ferry's weekly service from Dubai to southern Iraq. Dubai Ports Authority received U.N. approval to include a stop in Bahrain's port of Salman in November, the authority's chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, said late Saturday. As of December 25, 1999, the Jabal Ali 1, a luxury ferry that can carry up to 510 passengers and 500 tons of cargo, is to travel from Dubai to Bahrain, then on to the southern Iraqi port of Basra. In November 1998, the United Arab Emirates became the first Gulf country to permit passenger and cargo ferry service with Iraq. The service caters mainly to business travelers and Shiite Muslim pilgrims headed to shrines in Iraq. The other option is flying to the Jordanian capital, Amman, then driving 10 hours to Baghdad.

20000420-20030319 Transition 

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) re-opened on April 20, 2000 its embassy in Iraq after ten-year break caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, official sources in Baghdad said. The embassy, located temporarily in the Al Rashid Hotel, was opened at the level of charge d'affaires, the sources said. The opening ceremony was attended by diplomats accredited in Iraq. The UAE is the fourth Gulf Arab state to re-establish relations with Iraq, after Bahrain, Oman and Qatar. The UAE is also one of the most outspoken countries in favor of the lifting of United Nations economic sanctions on Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait do not have diplomatic relations with Iraq, but Riyadh conducts commercial transactions with Baghdad under the U.N. humanitarian program for Iraq. 

Iraq has reopened its embassy in the United Arab Emirates, 10 years after the two countries froze ties following Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq's acting Charge d'affaires Abdel-Razzak Hamoudi said on July 4, 2000. Hamoudi raised his country's flag over the embassy's temporary offices at a hotel in the capital Abu Dhabi in the presence of Emirates Foreign Ministry officials and other diplomats. The United Arab Emirates is the fourth Gulf Arab state after Qatar, Bahrain and Oman to resume diplomatic relations with Iraq.

On March 20, 2003, US invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein's regime. The relations between Iraq and UAE improved in the aftermath of that invasion. The United Arab Emirates said on January 20, 2004, that it was willing to forgive most of Iraq's US$3.8 billion debt to the Gulf state. The announcement followed similar concessions from European and Asian countries. Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, made the announcement after a visit from former U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Baker is traveling around the world on behalf of U.S. President George W. Bush in an effort to persuade countries to forgive Iraqi debt. Sheik Khalifa said the government would enter into negotiations with a new Iraqi government that is scheduled to assume sovereignty from the U.S.-led occupying power by July 1, 2004. He said most of the debt would be forgiven if those talks go well. Iraq owes about US$40 billion to the so-called Paris Club of major creditor nations and another US$80 billion to Arab governments, including US$45 billion to the Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. A senior Emirates official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iraq owes the Emirates 14 billion dirhams-US$3.8 billion. During Baker's tour, which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, he will try to persuade oil-rich countries in the Middle East to forgive billions of dollars in debt accumulated by Iraq during the rule of Saddam Hussein, who was deposed by a U.S.-led invasion in April. Baker began his campaign with agreements from Russia, Germany and France-which opposed the war in Iraq-to cooperate in debt reduction. Later, Japan agreed to cut billions of dollars of Iraqi debts and China said it would consider the idea. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the British leader welcomed Baker's mission and was working with the United States to reduce Iraq's debt. He said Iraqowes Britain 1.15 billion pounds (US$2 billion) but gave no indication whether Britain would forgive that debt. "Mr. Blair welcomes the growing international consensus for substantial debt reduction and supports the vast majority of Iraq's debt being written off," the official said on customary condition of anonymity. Iraq owes the United States more than US$4 billion. That includes US$1.9 billion in principal and US$1.1 billion in interest on Agriculture Department-guaranteed loans.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki discussed his attempts to end Iraq's insurgency in a meeting with the president of the United Arab Emirates on July 3, 2006. The president, Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq and called on political parties to rise above their differences, the official news agency WAM reported. "Reason must prevail," WAM quoted Sheik Khalifa as saying. "The greater interest of Iraq should take precedence over any political differences or animosities." The president also urged the world to take a more proactive role in Iraq in order to give its people the chance to resume reconstruction and development efforts. He said the UAE would all necessary support for this goal. The Iraqi prime minister arrived in the Emirates earlier on July 3, 2006, on the second leg of a Gulf tour to drum up support for his new unity government of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds and its plans for reconciliation among Iraq's rival factions.
