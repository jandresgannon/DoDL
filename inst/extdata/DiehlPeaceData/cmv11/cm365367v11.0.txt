TERRMID-NOTES: MID2604 from Gibler 2018, Latvia had been occupied by Russia during WWI and began pushing for independence in 1918. In 1919, the Soviets invaded and occupied (now) independent Latvia, wanting it to be part of the Soviet Union, but Latvia fought back. Germany and Poland intervened militarily to push the Soviets back. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Russia and Latvia.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID4103 from cm narrative, the Russian defense minister ordered Russian troops in Latvia (a) to go on alert in response to the detention of 2 Russian generals by Latvian paramilitaries and (b) to take all measures to prevent provocations against Russian citizens in Latvia.
