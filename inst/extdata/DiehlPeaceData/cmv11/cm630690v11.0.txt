TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3108 from Gibler 2018, during the Iran-Iraq War, Iran attacked a Kuwaiti frontier post. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE denounced the attack. Iran claimed the attack was accidental and meant for Iraq, but Kuwait disagreed. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute; this is true whether or not the attack on Kuwait was intentional.

RIVNOTES: 
This is not a rivalry - all MIDs are related to the Iran-Iraq war.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Kuwait protested on June 13, 1981 that several Iranian military aircraft had violated its airspace and fired on a border post in Kuwait. Iranian military aircraft attacked an oil installation in northern Kuwait on October 1, 1981. Iranian naval ships seized the Kuwaiti cargo vessel *Ibn al-Baytar* in the Gulf of Oman on November 25, 1985. An Iranian helicopter attacked the Kuwaiti tanker *Al-Qadhuria* near Qatar on December 26, 1985.

NARRATIVE-CR: The MIDs occurring between Kuwait and Iran from 1980 until 1988 took place in the context of the Iran-Iraq War. During this war, Kuwait along with Saudi Arabia was one of the chief financial backers of Iraq. In efforts to cut off this support, Iran employed a number of tactics directed at Kuwaiti interests. These included direct military overtures, bombing of Kuwaiti shipping, threats to bomb Kuwaiti shipping, bombing tankers carrying Kuwaiti oil, and cutting off access to the Persian Gulf. 

MID3108 occurred from November 11 through 16 1980. Kuwait reported Iranian air raids on the border post of Abdali on the Kuwaiti side of the Kuwait-Iraq border. Kuwait protested to the Arab League, Islamic Conference Organization, the Nonaligned Movement, and the UN. Kuwait argued that the attack was deliberate. Iran argued that it was a mistake, that the attack was intended for the Iraqi side of the border. 

MID3095 took place on 10/1/1981. Here Iranian military aircraft attacked an oil installation in northern Kuwait. 

MID3081 occurred on 7/18/1982. Iran admonished and implicitly warned Kuwait for aiding Iraq. Kuwait accused Iran of training terrorists for infiltration into Kuwait. 

MID3617 occurred from May of 1984 until July. This is a multilateral mid involving Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia vs. Iran. Here the issue is the war between Iran and Iraq. Iraq is receiving support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in its war against Iraq. Iran wants to limit that support. They do so by bombing Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf and making it clear that they are doing so in response to the Saudi support of the Iraqis. They widen the bombing to include tankers of all the gulf states. On 5/17/1984 Iranian war planes bombed a Saudi oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. This was the fifth such attack in a three week period. On May 21, 1984 an Iranian newspaper suggested that Iran's air force bomb power stations in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to force them to stop supporting Iraq in its war with Iran. Iraq is also bombing Iranian tankers or tankers flagged with other countries that attempt to take on oil at Iranian ports. 

MID3625 occurred from November of 1985 until March of 1986. This was a multilateral mid involving Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the US, and the UK vs. Iran. At this point in the Iran-Iraq War, Iran gained a foothold in Iraq and was able to repel counter offensives successfully. Emboldened by this success, Iran renewed threats to other Gulf states that were supporting Iraq in the war. It specifically threatened Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as the prime financial backers of Iraq in the war. The United States and the UK both committed support for their allies, the Saudis and Kuwaitis, should they be attacked by Iran.

MID2587 is a multilateral mid involving Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait vs. Iran. This is a one day mid taking place on 8/29/1986. Here again the motivation for this mid is the squeeze Iran was trying to put on other gulf states in an effort to bleed Iraq dry of cash. Here Iran threatened to close the Gulf of Hormuz that would effectively cut off access to the Persian Gulf and cripple the oil exporting capacity of the Gulf States. 

MID2594 occurred on 10/22/1986. Iranian aircraft violated Kuwaiti airspace. Kuwaiti forces fired two missles at the aircraft downing one. 

MID2797 occurred from May of 1987 until May of 1988. Here the United States reflagged 11 Kuwaiti tankers with US flags. Kuwait described this as a commercial action to protect its commercial interests. This may have been in part true. However, there is speculation that Kuwait made this decision in an effort to internationalize the conflict. Iran responded to this strategy by applying military pressure to Kuwaiti ports. From September of 1987 on, Iran attacked Kuwaiti oil terminals with Silkworm missiles from gunboats in the Persian Gulf. 

The Iran-Iraq War ended on August 20, 1988, with a UN proposed cease-fire. This marked the end of formal support by Kuwait to the Iraqis. This in turn ended the motivation for the Iranians to harass the Kuwaitis. Because the rivalry between Iran and Kuwait is a result of conditions and circumstances in the Iran-Iraq War, when the war ends so does the rivalry between Iran and Kuwait. 

I was not able to locate information on MID2554. I looked in the New York Times, the Times (London), Facts on File, Lexus Nexus, and the print sources listed below. This is a one day mid occurring in 1985. J. Klein
