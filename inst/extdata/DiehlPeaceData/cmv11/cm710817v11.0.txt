ISLMID-NOTES: MID1452 from Gibler 2018, in 1956 a Filipino man landed with armed men at one of the Spratly Islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea that is disputed by six different states.

Chinese troops then seized a Philippine fishing boat in the disputed waters around the islands. Coded islands MID because this was linked to an islands dispute between China and South Vietnam/Philippines.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The *People's Republic of China* (PRC) and South Vietnam disputed the sovereignty of the Paracel and Spratly islands following South Vietnam's independence from France on December 29, 1954. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of China had issued a statement on August 15, 1951 which suggested that the Paracel and Spratly islands "have always been China's territory" and that the PRC's sovereignty over them "will not be in any way affected." South Vietnamese troops landed on Duncan Island in February 1959, and apprehended some 50 Chinese fishermen on the island. The *Commonwealth of Nations* (CON) heads of state offered to mediate between China and South Vietnam on June 19, 1965, but China rejected the mediation offer on June 25, 1965. South Vietnamese gunboats fired on several Chinese fishermen on one of the islands in the Paracels on January 16, 1974, and South Vietnamese troops expelled the fishermen from the island on January 18, 1974. Chinese and South Vietnamese troops clashed on Duncan (Chenhang) island on January 19, 1974, resulting in the deaths of two South Vietnamese soldiers. Chinese and South Vietnamese naval units also clashed on January 19, 1974, resulting in the deaths of 59 South Vietnamese naval personnel. Chinese troops expelled South Vietnamese troops from Pattle, Robert, and Money islands on January 20, 1974. South Vietnam referred the matter to the *United Nations* (UN) Security Council on January 20, 1974. South Vietnamese troops occupied six islands in the Spratly group on January 31, 1974, and China protested against the occupation of the islands on February 4, 1974. South Vietnam fell to the North Vietnamese troops on April 30, 1975.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Two issues motivate the rivalry between China and South Vietnam. They are territorial claims to the Sratly and Paracel Islands and PRC support for North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese Communist Rebels. 

MID1452 was a multilateral dispute between South Vietnam (RVN), China, Taiwan, and the Philippines. In May of 1956, the Philippine government laid claim to the Spratly Islands for the first time. The PRC, Taiwan, and South Vietnam (RVN) disputed this claim. In August of 1956, an RVN garrison occupied one of the Spratly islands. 

MID2862 took place on February 2, 1959. Here the PRC charged that South Vietnam landed a gunboat on Duncan Island in the Paracel Island chain. They further charged that the S. Vietnamese captured 82 fishermen and several fishing vessels. 

During the Vietnam War, MID611, China and South Vietnam clashed over the PRC support for North Vietnamese and South Vietnamese Rebels. The Chinese provided direct and indirect support to the communist forces. 

MID1216 occurs from December of 1965 until August of 1965. This MID is a multilateral MID involving China and Cambodia on one side with Thailand, South Vietnam and the US on the other. Here the hostility centers in Cambodia. After cultivating close relations with the US in 1963, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk cancelled all military and economic aid from the US and broke of diplomatic relations with the US in 1965. He felt the Vietnamese Communists in South Vietnam were eventually going to win the struggle for power and entered into a compromise agreement with them. He allowed the NLF and North Vietnam to set up bases along the Cambodian border with South Vietnam and permitted the receipt of shipments at its main port from China and the USSR. Prince Sihanouk got in return the pledge that the Vietnamese would respect Cambodian independence. Additionally he received a pledge that the Vietnamese would not support the Khmer Rouge insurgency that was opposing the Prince. The US along with its allies Thailand and South Vietnam made several incursions into Cambodia in pursuit of Communist forces. In this MID Cambodia made threats to make reprisal attacks and implicitly called on China for assistance in threats to the US. 

MID1806 occurs from January of 1968 until April of 1968. This is another multilateral MID with the USA and South Vietnam on one side and the PRC and Cambodia on the other. This MID is similar to MID1216. The US and South Vietnam pursue communist forces into Cambodia. Cambodian border guards clashed with the US and South Vietnam. China threatened to intervene on behalf of Cambodia. 

In January of 1974, MID355 and MID3217 occurred. These are disputes over the Parcel and the Spratly Islands. Here there was a series of incidents in the two island chains. PRC naval forces expelled South Vietnamese garrisons from the islands in a series of land and sea battles throughout January of 1974. The fighting ended with the seizure of Duncan Island on January 24, 1974.

The rivalry with South Vietnam ended with the defeat of South Vietnam by North Vietnam on April 30, 1975. Following the defeat of South Vietnam, the unified Vietnam remained a rival to the PRC. See narrative cm710816.

I had difficulty finding reference to MID2884. I searched the New York Times, the Times of London, Facts on File, a general search in Google.com and the print references listed in Sources CR. I extended the date ranges on both sides of the listed date, 4/4/1961 (a one day bilateral MID). I was not successful in finding reference to this MID. J. Klein
