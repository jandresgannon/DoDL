MARITMID-NOTES: MID2813 from Gibler, Little, and Miller (2016: IIB-28), on 2/13/1987, Argentina seized a Japanese fishing vessel in Argentine waters. Japan admitted the boat was illegally in the waters. GLM suggest this case be dropped because Japan offered no protest and thus this should not be a MID, so this is coded uncertain. Coded not maritime because the boundary was not disputed.
