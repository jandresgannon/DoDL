CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID2150 from NYT 4/5/1977 and 5/12/1977, Zaire was facing an ongoing civil war. The government was, at one point, in danger of falling to rebels who were fighting near the capital. The Zaire government received money and arms from the French government, and Cuba was supplying arms and personnel to fight with the rebels against the government. The opposing support brings Cuba and France into this MID against each other here. Coded civil war link because this MID occurs due to the civil war in Zaire, outside of this dyad.
