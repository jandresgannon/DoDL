CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID128 from Gibler (2018), Macedonia was officially under Ottoman control but had descended into lawlessness and anarchy. From Gibas-Krzak (2013), this included a revolutionary movement made up of militarized rebels. Several countries, including UK, Russia, and Austria-Hungary, proposed intervening to restore order by implementing several reforms, including direct military intervention. The Ottomans resisted this and kept its troops in Macedonia, while the UK further instigated the turmoil, issued threats to intervene, and several countries (including Austria-Hungary) deployed ships to the waters close to Macedonia, triggering this MID between Turkey and UK, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia. Coded civil war link because the militarized rebel group activity in Macedonia (outside this dyad) was connected to the events of this MID. Note that Macedonia is not independent at this time, so the conflict within Macedonia (under Ottoman/Turkey) causes this to be a civil conflict MID.

RIVNOTES: 
RIV10791 was originally two separate rivalries (RIV791 and RIV792) but the temporal proximity of the disputes (<17 years) and that the disputes involved Austrian support of allies (Greece and Serbia) in the support of territorial concessions led the rivalries to be combined. 

Rivalry from riv30 eliminated in riv500 because disputes have been incorporated in other rivalries:

NARRATIVE-CR:
The first rivalry in the 19th century was touched off by the Hungarian revolution of 1848. Hungarian revolutionaries declared their independence from the Hapsburg Empire and sought support from their one-time adversaries, the Turks. Backed by the Ottoman Empire, the revolutionaries succeeded in defeating the Hapsburg army several times before the Russians intervened. However, on June 17th of 1849, the Russians intervened on behalf of the Hapsburgs and invaded Hungary with an overwhelming force. Hungarian forces were crushed and Hungary remained under the rule of the Hapsburg Empire despite assistance from Turkey (Clodfelter 1992). Fleeing from Hungary many Hungarians took refuge in the Ottoman Empire despite Russian demands for extradition. Turkey refused and with the support of Britain held their position of protection for the Hungarian refugees (NY Times 2/3/1863). Russia and Austria maintained their positions and demanded the return of the refugees. Russia threatened war with the Turks over the issue. In response, Count Leiningen (of Austria) instigated a conflict with Turkey over the issue of Montenegro (MID126). Turkey succeeded in refusing the demands of Austria and Russia initially but eventually lost Montenegro in the wars of 1852-77 (Clodfelter 1992).

Conflict between Austria-Hungary and Turkey was ignited a third time over the issue of Serbian independence again in 1876 (MID3322). Turkey launched an all out offensive against Serbia in August of 1876 and successfully defeated Serbian forces (Clodfelter 1992). Austrian support of Serbia came through the lending of troops in the war against Turkey. In response Turkey negotiated a ceasefire on October 18th of 1876. In 1881 the Western Powers (Austria is included) granted Thessaly and Arta to Greece in response to the Greek discontent over the Treaty of Berlin, which served mainly to benefit the Ottoman Empire (MID141). Thessaly and Arta were given to Greece while the rest of the territories were returned to Turkey (Stavrianos 2000). The Allied Powers again intervened in 1897 (MID56). The Ottoman Empire/Turkey had claimed rights over Crete insisting that the island was Muslim and not Christian and therefore not rightly the property of Greece (Danopoulos 1997). By 1897 Greece began sending troops to Crete and began hostilities with Turkey. Allied intervention in 1897 forced an Armistice and then a Peace Treaty between Greece and Turkey. December 4th the Treaty was concluded and Crete was made an international protectorate in exchange for Greece granting Turkey some land in Thessaly and a tribute. Another dispute regarding territorial claims between Greece and Turkey in the region of Macedonia led to conflict in 1905 (MID128). Ultimately, these disputes would lead to the First Balkan War. Following the First Balkan War, Crete was awarded to Greece in the Treaty of London in 1913 (Stavrianos 2000). Following the First World War the Austria-Hungarian Empire was dismantled and therefore there were no further disputes following the First Balkan War.
