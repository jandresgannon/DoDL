MID27 

TERRMID: MID27 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID27 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID27 coded not territory because the territorial dispute involved here is between East and West Germany, outside of this dyad. See TERRLINK.

TERRLINK: MID27 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID27 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID27 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID involving Czechoslovakia, Poland, East Germany, and the USSR versus the USA, the UK, France, and West Germany. This is the Berlin Wall crisis. The Berlin dispute had simmered ever since Khrushchev threatened (1958) to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. This action would seriously threaten the status of West Berlin, as well as Western access to the city.The Soviets, for their part, were particularly concerned with the growing military strength of West Germany, and, in particular, the installation of tactical nuclear weapons in West Germany. The East German government was increasingly concerned about the defection of East German citizens moving from East to West Berlin. The Berlin Wall began to be constructed on 8/13/1961 and produced an immediate heightening of tensions, including shows-of-strength and diplomatic sanctions by both sides. Coded third party link to territorial MID because France, backing West Germany, was a third party to the East Germany-West Germany territorial dispute, and this MID is connected to that dispute. East and West Germany each claimed the entirety of each other's territory, and the support by France to West Germany in that dispute contributed to this MID.
