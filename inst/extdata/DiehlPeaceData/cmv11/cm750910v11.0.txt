CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3572 from Gibler 2018, in 1992 Indonesian troops crossed into Papua New Guinea, into Iryan Jaya, to pursue militarized rebels. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebels in Papua New Guinea. Coded uncertain because Indonesia, not India, is the other participant in this dispute with PNG, and India's involvement in this MID is a coding mistake.
