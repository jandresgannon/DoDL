TERRMID: MID1265 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1265 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1265 from Gibler 2018, after WWI, several countries, including Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, pressed territorial claims against Hungary, recently broken away from Austria-Hungary. Here, Romania attacked Hungary to claim territory from Hungary, and the Allies allowed this to happen and facilitated the Hungarian surrender of territory to Romania. Coded territorial MID because Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute which ended with the forceful transfer of territory from Hungary to Romania.

TERRMID-CER: MID3182 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3182 from Gibler 2018, Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute after WWI, and a boundary commission was ongoing in 1923. Romania protested several Hungarian incursions into the disputed territory, and minor clashes occurred. Coded territorial MID because Romania and Hungary clashed over disputed territory here.

TERRMID: MID3181 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID3181 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3181 from Gibler 2018, Austria's economy was crippled after WWI. It was looking to unify with either Germany or the Little Entente (Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia), but Italy declared that this would be a cause for war. Italy and Yugoslavia amassed troops on their Austrian borders as a show of force to prevent Austria from joining Germany or the Little Entente. The League of Nations and the US eventually negotiated a solution. Coded not territory because no states were disputing territory here, although Austria was intending to voluntarily unify with another country (other countries) to solve its economic crisis. Coded uncertain because Gibler (2018) drops Hungary from this dispute, as they seem to have no part in it.

TERRMID: MID1247 1 -- territorial MID 
TERRMID-CER: MID1247 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1247 from Gibler 2018, this MID occurred in the lead-up to WWII. Romania claimed the Czech territory of Carpatho-Ukraine, which was also claimed by Hungary. There was some lack of clarity about where precisely the border was in some areas of Carpatho-Ukraine. Germany signalled to Hungary that Hungary could annex all of the territory, but there was a growing domestic unrest in Carpatho-Ukraine that wanted independence. In March 1939, Romania suddenly invaded to prevent Hungary from doing so, expelling the Czechs as well. Clashes occurred between Romania and Hungary, and Hungary seized the territory the following day. Romania soon thereafter abandoned its claim on the territory. Coded territroial MID because an invasion and exchange of fire occurred over the disputed territory.

TERRMID-CER: MID1718 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1718 from Gibler 2018, Romania noticed that China and the USSR became distant and began strengthening its own ties with China. The USSR took this as an insult and coordinated military exercises with Hungary and Czechoslovakia along Romania's border, but tensions died down soon thereafter. Coded not terriory because no territory was being disputed. This was an attempt to deter strengthening diplomatic ties between Romania and China.

The Treaty of Trianon went into effect on July 26, 1921. The Romanian government approved an agrarian law in Transylvania on July 30, 1921, which provided for the expropriation of lands owned by Hungarians. Hungary referred the matter to the *Allied Conference of Ambassadors* (ACA), which consisted of representatives from Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the US, on August 16, 1922, but the ACA suggested that Hungary refer the matter to the *League of Nations* (LON). Hungarian and Romanian troops clashed near Lokoshaza on January 10, 1923. Hungary referred the matter of the Romanian agrarian law to the LON Council on March 15, 1923. Hungary and Romania signed a border agreement on June 29, 1925. Hungary and Romania disagreed on the competence of the Mixed Arbitral Tribunal to decide on claims "arising out of the application of the Romanian Agrarian Law" to Hungarian nationals. Romania referred the matter to the LON Council on February 24, 1927. The LON Council established a three-member conciliation commission (Britain, Chile, Japan) chaired by Sir Austen Chamberlain of Britain on March 7, 1927. The LON conciliation commission submitted a report to the LON Council on September 17, 1927. The LON Council approved a resolution on September 19, 1927, which recommended the report to the governments of Hungary and Romania for consideration. Romania accepted the LON conciliation commission report on November 25, 1927, but Hungary rejected the report on November 29, 1927.

Romania's sovereignty over Transylvania was confirmed by the 1947 peace treaty. Hungarian and Romanian representatives signed a *Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance* on January 24, 1948.

NARRATIVE-CR:

Romania supported the Allied powers against Austria-Hungary and Germany in the First World War and declared war against Austria-Hungary in 1916 (Clodfelter 1992). Romanian troops invaded Hungary in 1919 (MID1265) as part of WWI. In 1920 Hungary and Romania provided for reparations over WWI with the treaty of Trianon (Grenville 1980). The treaty settled the issue of expropriation of lands owned by Hungarians and gave Romania the territory of Transylvania. Lands were redistributed from wealthy Hungarians to Romanian peasants which radically changed the distribution of power in Romania. In September and October of 1922 conflict arose over the Romanian adoption of a new constitution (MID3181) which prohibited the ownership of land by foreigners and allowed citizenship of Jews (Clodfelter 1992). These reforms ended the ownership of land by Hungarian citizens and resolved the source of tension following WWI. 

The second rivalry between Romania and Hungary are all related to the Second World War (MID258). Hungary, backed by Germany relit the flames regarding Transylvania and the treatment of ethnic Hungarians within Romania. German pressure forced Romania to give Transylvania to Hungary in 1940, ending the first two disputes over the border (MID1247 and MID2823). MID3870 was a small, one day dispute regarding troops in Transylvania and was resolved with the entrance of Romania into the war on the side of Germany against Russia. In 1944 Russian forces invaded and occupied Romania. In October of 1944 Russian/Romanian forces entered and liberated Transylvania from Hungarian forces (Clodfelter 1992). Russia officially returned Transylvania to Romania in March of 1945 (Clodfelter 1992). Defeat of Hungary and return of control over Transylvania ended the rivalry between Romania and Hungary. 

A final, isolated border dispute MID1718 came about as the result of the Warsaw pact conducting military exercises along Hungary's border with Romania in August of 1971 (www.1upinfo.com 2003). This was an isolated incident that was resolved through diplomacy between the USSR and Hungary.
