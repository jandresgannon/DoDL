TERRMID-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1793 from Gibler 2018, in 1947-1948, Israelis and Palestinians disputed who would control the area that is modern-day Israel. The Israelis declared independence and sovereignty over the land in 1948. A coalition of Arab nations (Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan) attacked Israel that same day because they denied Israel's claim to sovereignty and wanted a Palestine state instead. A war broke out, and Israel emerged victorious in 1949. Coded territorial MID because Iraq disputed Israel's claim to the territory. 

TERRLINK: MID1793 1 -- third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1793 1 -- certain

TERRMID-CER: MID3386 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3386 from Gibler 2018, in 1949-1950 Israeli and Egyptian forces clashed in the Negev Desert until Egyptian troops returned to Egypt. From cm narrative, the countries were disputing territory, as Egypt denied Israel's right to exist as a country, disputed the UN decision to grant Israel the land from Palestine, and disputed Israel's unilateral expansion of its borders after it was recognized as a state. These issues fueled a rivalry between Egypt and Israel. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute.

Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the tension between Israel and Egypt, which was connected to Egypt denying Israel's right to exist.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID3429 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this MID occurs simultaneously with MID3405 and includes the same events: a series of border clashes between Israel and Egypt.

MID200 

TERRMID: MID200 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID200 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID200 from Gibler 2018, this is the Sinai War and the Suez Crisis. Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, endangering Israel's trade. Israel and Egypt then clashed in the Sinai, which itself was being disputed. Fighting continued until 1956. This led Israel to give up its claim on Gaza in 1957. Coded terriorial MID because this was connected to the Sinai Peninsula, which was being disputed.

TERRMID: MID3405 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID3405 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID3405 from Gibler 2018, from 1955-1960 Israel had a series of clashes with Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The clashes began between Israel and Syria. By this time, Egypt had stopped denying its claim that Israel had no right to exist (it had done so since the end of the Sinai conflict in MID200). This was connected to long-standing tensions between Egypt/Syria/Jordan and Israel, but neither Gibler 2018 nor cm narrative nor the numerous New York Times articles that cover these events (NYT 8/16/1954, 1/17/1955, 5/13/1955, 10/16/1955, 3/5/1956, 9/17/1956, 11/28/1956, 9/11/1957, 4/29/1957, 1/29/1958, 7/4/1958, 4/2/1959, 10/23/1959, 1/9/1959, 6/13/1960, 10/26/1960, 2/2/1960) mention that this was connected to any territorial issues.

MARITMID-CER: MID3375 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3375 from Gibler 2018, in 1957 Israel threatened war if Egypt prevented Israeli ships from accessing the Gulf of Aqaba. Threats and clashes followed until 1961. Coded maritime MID because, although Israel was not claiming the waters in the Gulf of Aqaba as their own, they were disputing Egypt's right to prevent Israel from using the waters.

TERRMID: MID3420 1 -- territorial MID 
TERRMID-CER: MID3420 3 -- uncertain 
TERRMID-NOTES: Coded territorial MID because per cm narrative, this is one of several MIDs that take place in the period between the Sinai Campaign in 1956 and the Six Day War in 1967, and these MIDs are motivated by Egypt disputing/denying Israel's independence. This amounts to a dispute over all of Israel's territory. However, there is no indication in Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016 or news coverage of this MID that this was directly connected to the territorial issue, so this is coded uncertain for this reason as well. See MARITMID-NOTES.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID3420 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this was originally coded as an Israeli seizure of Syria/Egypt/Jordan ships in 1958, but there is no evidence that this seizure occurred. GML therefore recommend this case be dropped, so coded uncertain. Coded maritime MID because per cm narrative, this is one of several MIDs that take place in the period between the Sinai Campaign in 1956 and the Six Day War in 1967, and these MIDs are motivated by Egypt disputing/denying Israel's independence. This amounts to a dispute over all of Israel's territory, including maritime boundaries.

MARITMID-CER: MID3419 1 -- certain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID3419 from Gibler 2018, Israel claimed the waters in the Sea of Galilee as within their territorial waters, but Egypt and Syria disputed that. Syrian fishermen continued to fish in the waters, often provoking clashes between Israel and Syria. At this time, Syria and Egypt were both members of the United Arab Republic, pulling Egypt into this MID although the clashes were between Israeli and Syrian jets. Coded maritime MID because this was connected to a dispute over the sea of Galilee, and Egypt as part of UAR is directly involved.

From New York Times 5/25/1959, Israel claimed the ship had entered its 6-mile territorial water limit. Coded not maritime because Egypt at this time disputed the entirety of Israel's borders, and by extension they denied Israel's maritime boundaries.

NARRATIVE-CR:

Introduction: 

There are two issues that motivate the rivalry between Israel and Egypt. The first issue motivates the rivalry between Israel and many of her Arab neighbors, is the right of Israel to exist. The second issue and the more proximate issue in some of the conflicts is the territorial dispute over the Sinai.

Disputes/MIDs:

Background and the Palestine War: 

The rivalry between Israel and Egypt (and its other Arab neighbors) begins in 1948 with Israel's independence from Britain. In 1922 Britain was given a League of Nations mandate over Palestine, following the 1917 Balfour declaration that stated Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. However, little progress toward the creation of a Jewish state was made until 1947 when Britain turned its responsibility for Palestine over to the United Nations. In November, 1947, the United Nations Committee on Palestine recommended that Palestine be partitioned into 2 parts. A new Jewish state would receive 57% of Palestine's land and have a 58% Jewish population, while the new Arab state would receive 43% of the land and have a 99% Arab population. Jerusalem and Bethlehem would be placed under a United Nations trusteeship. At the time, Jews made up approximately 1/3 of the population of Palestine and owned only about 7% of the land. The UN plan gave the fertile coastal region to the Jewish state, and United Nations' estimates were that the Jewish state would have economic revenues three times that of the new Arab state. Existing Arab states opposed the plan, and threatened fighting if partition was approved, but the UN General Assembly approved the plan 33 to 13 with 10 abstentions. Even before the plan went into effect, Zionists began to extend their control beyond the partition borders; the first Arab-Israeli war began with the invasion of Arab forces into Israel on May 15, 1948, after Israel officially declared its independence on May 14. The rivalry begins with this war referred to as the Palestine War or the Israeli War of Independence MID1793. 

MIDs from 1955 until the Sinai War (MID200):

Israeli troops attacked an Egyptian army base in the Gaza Strip on February 28, 1955, resulting in the deaths of 39 individuals. Egypt referred the matter to the UN Security Council and the *League of Arab States *(LAS) on March 20, 1955. The UN Security Council condemned the Israeli attack against Egypt on March 29, 1955. Egypt and Israel resumed military hostilities in the Gaza Strip on August 22, 1955. Czechoslovakia agreed to provide military assistance (weapons) to Egypt on September 27, 1955. Egyptian troops attacked an Israeli police station in the El Auja area on October 26-27, 1955, resulting in the death of one Israeli. Israeli troops attacked Egyptian targets near Kuntilla in the Sinai peninsula on October 28, 1955, resulting in the deaths of ten Egyptians. Some 360 Israeli soldiers and civilians were killed between 1949 and 1955. The conflict during this period is represented in the following MIDs: MID3386, MID3370, MID3372, MID3371, MID3374, MID3373, and MID3429. 

Sinai War: 

The next significant point of conflict between Israel and Egypt was the Sinai War MID200. `In early 1955, Egypt began sponsoring raids launched by fedayeen (Arab commandos or guerrillas) from the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, and Jordan, into Israel. As the number and seriousness of these raids increased, Israel began launching reprisal raids against Arab villages in Gaza and the West Bank of the Jordan. These retaliatory measures, which cost the lives of Arab civilians and did little to discourage the fedayeen, became increasingly controversial both within Israel and abroad. Shortly thereafter Israeli reprisal raids were directed against military targets, frontier strongholds, police fortresses, and army camps.' 

`In addition to these incidents, that at times became confrontations between regular Israeli and Arab military forces, other developments contributed to the generally escalating tensions between Egypt and Israel and convinced Israeli military officials that Egypt was preparing for a new war. Under an arms agreement of 1955, Czechoslovakia supplied Egypt with a vast amount of arms, including fighter aircraft, tanks and other armored vehicles, destroyers, and submarines. The number of Egyptian troops deployed in Sinai along the Israeli border also increased dramatically in 1956. In July Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal; shortly thereafter Egypt closed the Strait of Tiran, at the southern tip of Sinai, and blockaded Israeli shipping.

Fearing these actions to be signs of an imminent Egyptian invasion, Israel rapidly mobilized its reserves. On October 29, under Major General Moshe Dayan, the IDF launched a preemptive attack into Sinai. Israeli advances on the ground were rapid, and, supported by air cover, by November 2 they had routed the Egyptian forces and effectively controlled the entire peninsula. With Israeli troops on the east bank of the Suez Canal, British and French troops landed at Port Said and demanded withdrawal of both sides from the Canal. The UN met in an emergency session and demanded that the British and French leave Suez, which they did in December 1956 in response to both United States and UN pressure, and that Israel withdraw to the Armistice line of 1949, which it did somewhat reluctantly in March 1957 after the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) had been stationed in the Gaza Strip and at Sharm ash Shaykh on the Strait of Tiran. 

Israel's victory in the 1956 Sinai War thus afforded it a modicum of increased security by virtue of the UN presence. Far more important, however, was that it enhanced Israel's standing as a military power and as a viable nation. Although many Israelis felt that the military victory was nullified by the UN demand to withdraw from Sinai, Israel had achieved significant psychological gains at a cost of fewer than 170 lives.' (Onwar.com)

From Sinai to the Six Day War: 

The Egyptian armistice line remained relatively quiet after the 1956 Sinai campaign. There were few incidents along the Jordanian line until 1965, when Egyptian-sponsored guerrilla raids by Al Fatah first occurred. Beginning in 1960, there were repeated guerrilla activities and shelling of Israeli settlements from the Golan Heights of Syria, but these incidents remained localized until 1964. 

Underlying tensions, however, did not abate. By the early 1960s, both sides considered a third round of war inevitable. An ominous arms race developed. Egypt and Syria were supplied with Soviet aid and military hardware, and Israel suddenly found European powers-the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), Britain, and especially France-to be willing suppliers of modern armaments. Jordan continued to receive arms from Britain and the United States. 

Tensions mounted in 1964, when, after Israel had nearly completed a massive irrigation project that involved diverting water from the Jordan River into the Negev Desert, Syria began a similar project near the river's headwaters that would have virtually dried the river bed at the Israeli location. Israel launched air and artillery attacks at the Syrian site, and Syria abandoned the project. Guerrilla incursions from Syria and Jordan steadily mounted, as did the intensity of Israeli reprisal raids. 

This period of conflict (between the Sinai Campaign in 1956 and the Six Day War in 1967) included the following MIDs: MID3405 MID3375 MID3420 MID3419 MID3421 MID3430 MID3422 MID3406 MID3431 MID3376 MID3377 MID3378 MID3379 and MID3412. 

The Six Day War: 

In April 1967, increased Syrian aircraft-shelling of Israeli border villages encountered an Israeli fighter attack during which six Syrian MiGs were shot down. Syria feared that an all-out attack from Israel was imminent, and Egypt, with whom Syria had recently signed a mutual defense treaty, began an extensive military buildup in early May. On May 18, Egypt's president, Gamal Abdul Nasser, demanded the withdrawal of UN forces from Gaza and Sinai; Secretary General U Thant promptly agreed and removed the UNEF. Four days later, Nasser announced a blockade of Israeli shipping at the Strait of Tiran; an action that Israel since the 1956 War had stressed would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Jordan and Iraq rapidly joined Syria in its military alliance with Egypt.

On May 30, mounting public opinion led to the appointment of Dayan as minister of defense. Levi Eshkol, who had been both prime minister and minister of defense since Ben-Gurion's resignation in 1963, retained the prime minister's position. Dayan immediately made a series of public declarations that war could be avoided, while secretly planning a massive preemptive strike against the Arab enemy. On the morning of June 5, Israel launched a devastating attack on Arab air power, destroying about 300 Egyptian, 50 Syrian, and 20 Jordanian aircraft, mostly on the ground. This action, which virtually eliminated the Arab air forces, was immediately followed by ground invasions into Sinai and the Gaza Strip, Jordan, and finally Syria. Arab ground forces, lacking air support, were routed on all three fronts; by the time the UN-imposed cease-fire took effect in the evening of June 11, the IDF had seized the entire Sinai Peninsula to the east bank of the Suez Canal; the West Bank of Jordan, including East Jerusalem; and the Golan Heights of Syria. Unlike the aftermath of the 1956 War, however, the IDF did not withdraw from the areas it occupied in 1967. 

Israel was ecstatic about its swift and stunning victory, which had been achieved at the relatively low cost of about 700 lives. The IDF had proven itself superior to the far larger forces of the combined Arab armies. More important, it now occupied the territory that had harbored immediate security threats to Israel since 1948. For the first time since independence, the Israeli heartland along the Mediterranean Sea was out of enemy artillery range. The exploits of what was known in Israel as the Six-Day War soon became legend, and the commanders who led it became national heroes. 

Although control of the occupied territories greatly improved Israel's security from a geographical standpoint, it also created new problems. The roughly 1 million Arabs within the territories provided potential cover and support for infiltration and sabotage by Arab guerrillas. From shortly after the June 1967 War until 1970, a steady stream of men and weapons were sent into the West Bank by a number of guerrilla groups, in particular Al Fatah. Incidents of sabotage and clashes with Israeli security forces were commonplace.

The War of Attrition: 

The 1967 War set the stage for the 1969-1970 War of Attrition MID1480. The tarnished legitimacy of the Arab states following the June 1967 War was especially poignant in Egypt. Israeli troops were situated on the east bank of the Suez Canal, the canal was closed to shipping, and Israel was occupying a large piece of Egyptian territory. Nasser responded by maintaining a constant state of military activity along the canal-the so-called War of Attrition-between February 1969 and August 1970. Given the wide disparity in the populations of Israel and Egypt, Israel could not long tolerate trading casualties with the Egyptians. The Israeli government, now led by Golda Meir, pursued a policy of "asymmetrical response"-retaliation on a scale far exceeding any individual attack. 

As the tension along the Egyptian border continued to heat, United States secretary of state William Rogers proposed a new peace plan. In effect, the Rogers Plan was an interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution 242; it called for the international frontier between Egypt and Israel to be the secure and recognized border between the two countries. There would be "a formal state of peace between the two, negotiations on Gaza and Sharm ash Shaykh, and demilitarized zones." In November Israel rejected the offer, and in January 1970 Israeli fighter planes made their first deep penetration into Egypt. 

Following the Israeli attack, Nasser went to Moscow requesting advanced surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and other military equipment. After some wavering, the Kremlin committed itself to modernizing and retraining the Egyptian military. Egypt's new Soviet-made arsenal threatened to alter the regional military balance with Israel. The tension in Israeli-Soviet relations escalated in July 1970, when Israeli fighter planes shot down four Egyptian planes flown by Soviet pilots about thirty kilometers west of the canal. Fearing Soviet retaliation, and uncertain of American support, Israel in August accepted a cease-fire and the application of Resolution 242.

The Yom Kippur War/Ramadan War: 

The October 1973 War (known in Israel as the Yom Kippur War and in the Arab world as the Ramadan War) developed rapidly, and the coordinated Egyptian-Syrian offensive caught Israel by surprise (MID1046, MID353, and MID3380). On September 28, Palestinian guerrillas detained an Austrian train carrying Soviet Jews en route to Israel. Subsequent Egyptian and Syrian military deployments were interpreted by Israel as defensive actions in anticipation of Israeli reprisals. For one week, Israel postponed mobilizing its troops. Not until the morning of Yom Kippur (October 6), about six hours before the Arab offensive, were Israeli officials convinced that war was imminent; a mobilization of the reserves was then ordered. In the early days of the war, the IDF suffered heavy losses as Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal and overran Israeli strongholds, while Syrians marched deep into the Golan Heights. Israel launched its counteroffensive first against the Syrian front, and only when it had pushed the Syrians back well east of the 1967 cease-fire line (by October 15) did Israel turn its attention to the Egyptian front. In ten days of fighting, Israel pushed the Egyptian army back across the canal, and the IDF made deep incursions into Egypt. On October 24, with Israeli soldiers about one kilometer from the main Cairo-Ismailia highway and the Soviet Union threatening direct military intervention, the UN imposed a cease-fire. 

After several months of negotiations, during which sporadic fighting continued, Israel reached a disengagement agreement in January 1974, whereby the IDF withdrew across the canal and Israeli and Egyptian troops were separated in the Sinai by a UNEF-manned buffer zone. Israel signed a similar agreement with Syria on May 31, 1974, whereby Israel withdrew to the 1967 cease-fire line in the Golan Heights and a United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) occupied a buffer zone between Israeli and Syrian forces. On September 4, 1975, after further negotiations, the Second Sinai Disengagement Agreement was signed between Egypt and Israel that widened the buffer zone and secured a further Israeli withdrawal to the east of the strategic Gidi and Mitla passes. 

From Yom Kippur to Camp David: 

MID1061 occurred from April of 1974 until December of 1975. Palestinian insurgents based in southern Lebanon crossed into Israel and killed eighteen Israelis in the northern town of Qiryat Shemona. The Israelis responded by raining several villages in southern Lebanon and threatening Lebanon with massive retaliation if it allowed terrorists to operate from its territory. There were more terrorist attacks in May and June. This led to massive bombing raids on Palestinian camps in Lebanon and naval attacks on Lebanese ports. In December of 1974, Israeli planes attacked Palestinian targets on the outskirts of Beirut. From April through June of 1974, Egypt threatened to intervene in this dispute on behalf of Lebanon. 

MID3381 occurred from October of 1975 until March of 1976. Here Egypt threatened to retaliate against Israel for the increase in armaments it was acquiring from the United States. The 

MID3381 occurred from mid October 1975 until March of 1976. In speaking to a session of the Egyptian People's Assembly, said "escalation [of an arms buildup] by the other side will be met by escalation from our side, and the consequences of this must be obvious to all." This overture was in part, an effort by Sadat to influence the US to supply Egypt with US military aid. The MID ends at the beginning of March 1976 when the U.S. state department confirmed that the Ford Administration had started consultations with key congressional leaders on the proposed sale of six C-130 military transport jets to Egypt as the first step towards ending Washington's longstanding arms embargo against that country. 

MID3382 is coded as occurring from November 14 through 19 of 1977. This mid is coded as being an instance of a display of force initiated by Israel against Egypt in a five day bilateral mid. I was not able to locate any information regarding this mid in any sources. This mid is odd because this is the time that Sadat makes his first visit to Israel and makes history by being the first Egyptian or Arab leader to travel to Israel and speak in the Knesset.

MID3383 is a one day bilateral dispute that occurred on July 3, 1976. I was not able to find record of this dispute in any archival resource. 

Resolution: 

Egypt and Israel signed the *Disengagement of Forces Agreement* on January 18, 1974. Secretary-of-State Henry Kissinger of the US mediated the signing of a second disengagement agreement on September 4, 1975. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Israel on November 19-20, 1977, during the visit Sadat accepted the existence of the state of Israel. Israeli Prime Minister visited Egypt on December 25-26, 1977. President Jimmy Carter of the US hosted talks between Egypt and Israel at Camp David, Maryland from September 5-17, 1978. President Carter mediated negotiations beginning on March 8, 1979, and Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in Washington DC on March 26, 1979. Egypt and Israel exchanged instruments of ratification of the peace treaty in the Sinai Peninsula on April 25, 1979. UNEF II personnel, which had suffered 55 fatalities, was disbanded on July 24, 1979. UNTSO-OGE remained in the Sinai peninsula. The *Multinational Force and Observers* (MFO) was established in 1982 to supervise the implementation of the 1979 peace treaty. 

The other Arab states involved in the hostilities with Israel rejected the Camp David Accords. The basis for Arab rejection was opposition to Egypt's separate peace with Israel. Although Sadat insisted that the treaty provided for a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Arab states and the PLO saw it as a separate peace, which Sadat had vowed he would not sign. The Arabs believed that only a unified Arab stance and the threat of force would persuade Israel to negotiate a settlement of the Palestinian issue that would satisfy Palestinian demands for a homeland. Without Egypt's military power, the threat of force evaporated because no single Arab state was strong enough militarily to confront Israel alone. Thus, the Arabs felt betrayed and dismayed that the Palestinian issue, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, would remain an unresolved, destabilizing force in the region.

The Camp David Accords brought peace to Egypt but not prosperity. With no real improvement in the economy, Sadat became increasingly unpopular. His isolation in the Arab world was matched by his increasing remoteness from the mass of Egyptians. While Sadat's critics in the Arab world remained beyond his reach, increasingly he reacted to criticism at home by expanding censorship and jailing his opponents. In addition, Sadat subjected the Egyptians to a series of referenda on his actions and proposals that he invariably won by more than 99 percent of the vote. For example, in May 1979 the Egyptian people approved the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty by 99.9 percent of those voting.

In May 1980, an impressive, nonpartisan body of citizens charged Sadat with superseding his own constitution. Their manifesto declared, "The style in which Egypt is governed today is not based on any specific form of government. While it is not dictatorship, Nazism, or fascism, neither is it democracy or pseudodemocracy." 

In September 1981, Sadat ordered the biggest roundup of his opponents since he came to power, at least 1,500 people according to the official figure but more according to unofficial reports. The Muslim Brotherhood bore the brunt of the arrests. The supreme guide of the Brotherhood, Umar Tilmasani, and other religious militants were arrested. Sadat also withdrew his "recognition" of the Coptic pope Shenudah III, banished him to a desert monastery, and arrested several bishops and priests. Also arrested were such prominent figures as journalist Mohamed Heikal, and Wafd leader Fuad Siraj ad Din. Sadat ordered the arrest of several SLP leaders and the closing of Ash Shaab (The People) newspaper. A referendum on his purge showed nearly 99.5 percent of the electorate approved. 

On October 6, 1981, while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War, Sadat was assassinated by members of Al Jihad movement, a group of religious extremists. Sadat's assassin was Lieutenant Colonel Khalid al Islambuli. The conspirators were arrested and tried. In April 1982, two of the conspirators were shot and three hanged. Whereas a number of Western leaders, including three former United States presidents, attended Sadat's funeral, only one member of the Arab League was represented by a head of state, Sudan and only two, Oman and Somalia, sent representatives. In Egypt 43 million people went on with the celebration of Id al Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, as if nothing had happened. There were no throngs in the streets, grieving and lamenting, as there were when Nasser died. In the Arab world, Sadat's death was greeted with jubilation.

MID3384 occurred in January of 1983 and MID3385 occurred from August of 1983 until July of 1985. Both of these mids cover the dispute between Egypt and Israel over the Taba Strip. Egypt and Israel disputed the ownership of a small strip of land-about 250 acres-called the Taba Strip. This bit of land is on the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba on the border between Egypt and Israel. The dispute over this parcel arose during the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai as agreed in the 1979 peace treaty that was completed in April of 1982. In MID3384 an Egyptian tractor moved into the disputed area to clear land for the construction of some structures. Israel protested this action and Egypt claimed it was an error. The Egyptians may have been responding to the construction of an Israeli hotel in the disputed zone. In general this period of conflict was low in intensity

By the late 1980s, about ten years after the signing of the Camp David Accords and the Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel a "cool" peace characterized Egyptian-Israeli relations. These relations had originally been envisioned as leading to a reconciliation between Israel and the Arab states, but this development had not occurred. Egyptian-Israeli relations were restrained by a number of developments, including the June 1981 Israeli bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon directed against Palestinian forces a year later, the establishment of an increasing number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the "watering down" of proposals for the autonomy of the Palestinian inhabitants of these territories as envisaged by the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 

Relations between the two countries warmed somewhat during Peres's tenure as prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in the National Unity Government. They again cooled, however, following the establishment of the Likud-led cabinet in December 1988, and prime minister Shamir's rejection of Israeli participation in an international peace conference with the PLO. Nevertheless, the two countries continued to maintain full diplomatic relations, and in 1985 about 60,000 Israeli tourists visited Egypt, although Egyptian tourism to Israel was much smaller. Cooperation occurred in the academic and scientific areas as well as in a number of joint projects in agriculture, marine science, and disease control. 

MID3915 occurred on June 3, 1989. An issue that had impeded normal relations between Egypt and Israel concerned the disposition of Taba, an approximately 100-hectare border enclave and tourist area on the Gulf of Aqaba in the Sinai Peninsula claimed by the two countries, but occupied by Israel. Following a September 1988 ruling in Egypt's favor by an international arbitration panel, official delegations from Israel and Egypt met to implement the arbitral award. Subsequently this MID occurred. This is a fishing boat incident. An Israeli fisherman was in Egyptian waters near Eliat. The Egyptian Coast Guard warned the man to refrain from fishing in the area. When he did not they fired on him, wounding him.

For 25 years, Egyptian-Israeli relations have often been characterized by tension. Today, their relationship continues to be frosty. Their peace has survived misperceptions, regional and international political changes, and unanticipated governmental upheavals. Neither state seeks a major confrontation with the other. Each believes the other has not done enough to stimulate improved understanding or agreement between Israel and her Arab neighbors. However, both are firmly committed to avoid any friction which would threaten continued U.S. aid. 

For Egypt, Israel has moved too slowly to return all the territories captured in the 1967 war and toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. Negative views toward Israel and Israelis are still widely held by Egyptian officials and citizens. Egypt acts both as Arab leader and champion in peaceful conflicts with Israel and equally as a mediator between Israel and Arab parties. 

For Israel, Egypt has been too slow to improve relations and has discouraged other Arab states from doing so. Israelis remain disappointed at the extent of normalization and also the tone of harsh criticism from both Egyptian officials and media organs. They realize that their relationship with Egypt is not going to be like that of the United States and Canada. Perhaps much of public statements from Egyptian sources-while highly objectionable and contrary to a spirit of normalization-may have to be written off as necessary for the management of Egyptian domestic constituencies.

Facts on File

SB-CR:
Egypt / Israel Years: 1948-1979. Issues at stake: Border (Sinai); existence of Israel. End coding: 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 9. Last militarized dispute: 1973. Wars: 1948-1949, 1956, 1967, 1969-1970, 1973. Summary: The rivalry between Israel and Egypt (and its other Arab neighbors) begins in 1948 with Israel's independence from Britain. In 1922 Britain was given a League of Nations mandate over Palestine, following the 1917 Balfour declaration that stated Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. However, little progress toward the creation of a Jewish state was made until 1947 when Britain turned its responsibility for Palestine over to the United Nations. In November, 1947, the United Nations Committee on Palestine recommended that Palestine be partitioned into 2 parts. A new Jewish state would receive 57% of Palestine's land and have a 58% Jewish population, while the new Arab state would receive 43% of the land and have a 99% Arab population. Jerusalem and Bethlehem would be placed under a United Nations trusteeship. At the time, Jews made up approximately 1/3 of the population of Palestine and owned only about 7% of the land. The UN plan gave the fertile coastal region to the Jewish state, and United Nations' estimates were that the Jewish state would have economic revenues three times that of the new Arab state. Existing Arab states opposed the plan, and threatened fighting if partition was approved, but the UN General Assembly approved the plan 33 to 13 with 10 abstentions. Even before the plan went into effect, Zionists began to extend their control beyond the partition borders; the first Arab-Israeli war began with the invasion of Arab forces into Israel on May 15, 1948, after Israel officially declared its independence on May 14. The rivalry begins with that war. Israel was able to defeat the Arabs in the war, but the resulting map of Israel was quite different from the planned partition of Palestine. Egypt was in control of the Gaza strip, Jordan occupied much of the West Bank of the Jordan River, and Israel had extended its control into the Negev desert in the south and across Galilee in the North. These territorial changes, and the very question of whether Israel was a legitimate state given the way it had come into existence, set the stage for rivalry between Israel and its Arab neighbors for the next 30+ years. Conflict between Israel and Egypt continued through the next 25 years. The dyad is notable for the relatively high frequency of disputes, and more so for the frequency with which those disputes escalated to war. 

In 1956 Israel (with British and French assistance) captured the Sinai, the Gaza strip, and the Suez Canal but was forced to return them to Egypt in the cease-fire that followed. 

In 1967 Israel captured most of the Sinai, the Gaza strip, and advanced to the Suez Canal, keeping the territories and setting the stage for the 1969-1970 War of Attrition and the 1973 Yom Kippur War (October, 1973). 

Following the Yom Kippur War ceasefire in November, 1973, a continuing series of talks began between Egypt (Sadat came to power in 1970) and Israel. In 1974 Israeli forces began a pull back of forces that continued through 1975. In 1975 the two sides signed an interim peace pact in Geneva, and in 1978 the Camp David accords were signed by Sadat and Begin, but it was not until 1979 that a full peace treaty was signed. The treaty agreed to a phased withdrawal to the earlier Israeli and Egyptian borders, with the Gaza strip to remain under Israeli administration until eventually being given autonomy. 

Egypt also took the step of recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, a move which resulted in its alienation from the rest of the Arab World for a decade. Since the signing of the treaty there have been no militarized disputes between Egypt and Israel, although Egypt temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Israel over the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Talks between the two states resumed when Israel pulled out; Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai was completed in 1982, although talks on Gazan autonomy have continued. Further disagreements between the two countries over the terms of the peace agreement have been submitted to arbitration, and arbitration awards have been respected (e.g. the disputed frontier at the Taba, 1986).

President Jimmy Carter of the US hosted talks between Egypt and Israel at Camp David, Maryland from September 5-17, 1978. President Carter mediated negotiations beginning on March 8, 1979, and Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in Washington DC on March 26, 1979. Egypt and Israel exchanged instruments of ratification of the peace treaty in the Sinai Peninsula on April 25, 1979. UNEF II personnel, which had suffered 55 fatalities, was disbanded on July 24, 1979. UNTSO-OGE remained in the Sinai peninsula. The *Multinational Force and Observers* (MFO) was established in 1982 to supervise the implementation of the 1979 peace treaty. 

Egypt also took the step of recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, a move which resulted in its alienation from the rest of the Arab World for a decade. Since the signing of the treaty there have been no militarized disputes between Egypt and Israel, although Egypt temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Israel over the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Talks between the two states resumed when Israel pulled out; Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai was completed in 1982, although talks on Gazan autonomy have continued. Further disagreements between the two countries over the terms of the peace agreement have been submitted to arbitration, and arbitration awards have been respected (e.g. the disputed frontier at the Taba, 1986).

The Camp David Accords brought peace to Egypt but not prosperity. With no real improvement in the economy, Sadat became increasingly unpopular. His isolation in the Arab world was matched by his increasing remoteness from the mass of Egyptians. While Sadat's critics in the Arab world remained beyond his reach, increasingly he reacted to criticism at home by expanding censorship and jailing his opponents. In addition, Sadat subjected the Egyptians to a series of referenda on his actions and proposals that he invariably won by more than 99 percent of the vote. For example, in May 1979 the Egyptian people approved the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty by 99.9 percent of those voting.

In May 1980, an impressive, nonpartisan body of citizens charged Sadat with superseding his own constitution. Their manifesto declared, "The style in which Egypt is governed today is not based on any specific form of government. While it is not dictatorship, Nazism, or fascism, neither is it democracy or pseudodemocracy." 

In September 1981, Sadat ordered the biggest roundup of his opponents since he came to power, at least 1,500 people according to the official figure but more according to unofficial reports. The Muslim Brotherhood bore the brunt of the arrests. The supreme guide of the Brotherhood, Umar Tilmasani, and other religious militants were arrested. Sadat also withdrew his "recognition" of the Coptic pope Shenudah III, banished him to a desert monastery, and arrested several bishops and priests. Also arrested were such prominent figures as journalist Mohamed Heikal, and Wafd leader Fuad Siraj ad Din. Sadat ordered the arrest of several SLP leaders and the closing of Ash Shaab (The People) newspaper. A referendum on his purge showed nearly 99.5 percent of the electorate approved. 

On October 6, 1981, while observing a military parade commemorating the eighth anniversary of the October 1973 War, Sadat was assassinated by members of Al Jihad movement, a group of religious extremists. Sadat's assassin was Lieutenant Colonel Khalid al Islambuli. The conspirators were arrested and tried. In April 1982, two of the conspirators were shot and three hanged. Whereas a number of Western leaders, including three former United States presidents, attended Sadat's funeral, only one member of the Arab League was represented by a head of state, Sudan and only two, Oman and Somalia, sent representatives. In Egypt 43 million people went on with the celebration of Id al Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice, as if nothing had happened. There were no throngs in the streets, grieving and lamenting, as there were when Nasser died. In the Arab world, Sadat's death was greeted with jubilation.

MID3384 occurred in January of 1983 and MID3385 occurred from August of 1983 until July of 1985. Both of these mids cover the dispute between Egypt and Israel over the Taba Strip. Egypt and Israel disputed the ownership of a small strip of land-about 250 acres-called the Taba Strip. This bit of land is on the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba on the border between Egypt and Israel. The dispute over this parcel arose during the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai as agreed in the 1979 peace treaty that was completed in April of 1982. In MID3384 an Egyptian tractor moved into the disputed area to clear land for the construction of some structures. Israel protested this action and Egypt claimed it was an error. The Egyptians may have been responding to the construction of an Israeli hotel in the disputed zone. In general this period of conflict was low in intensity

By the late 1980s, about ten years after the signing of the Camp David Accords and the Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel a "cool" peace characterized Egyptian-Israeli relations. These relations had originally been envisioned as leading to a reconciliation between Israel and the Arab states, but this development had not occurred. Egyptian-Israeli relations were restrained by a number of developments, including the June 1981 Israeli bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon directed against Palestinian forces a year later, the establishment of an increasing number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the "watering down" of proposals for the autonomy of the Palestinian inhabitants of these territories as envisaged by the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. 

Relations between the two countries warmed somewhat during Peres's tenure as prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in the National Unity Government. They again cooled, however, following the establishment of the Likud-led cabinet in December 1988, and prime minister Shamir's rejection of Israeli participation in an international peace conference with the PLO. Nevertheless, the two countries continued to maintain full diplomatic relations, and in 1985 about 60,000 Israeli tourists visited Egypt, although Egyptian tourism to Israel was much smaller. Cooperation occurred in the academic and scientific areas as well as in a number of joint projects in agriculture, marine science, and disease control.

The last MID of RIV1246, MID3915 ended on June 3, 1989. The main issues that motivated the rivalry were the existence of Israel generally and the mutual border between the two. The territorial issue appears to be resolved. However, the more general issue of Israel's existence is more complicated and less clearly resolved. It is clearly mitigated but remains an issue that motivates tension and a continued preparation for hostilities between the two. 

By the late 1980s, about ten years after the signing of the Camp David Accords and the Treaty of Peace Between Egypt and Israel a "cool" peace characterized Egyptian-Israeli relations. These relations had originally been envisioned as leading to a reconciliation between Israel and the Arab states, but this development had not occurred. Because the comprehensive peace has failed to materialize, the issue of Israel's existence as a state continues to be an issue of tension. This is due in large part because of the cost Egypt has had to pay for their separate peace with the Israelis. Egypt sees Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and other Arab states as an abrogation of the treaty. They perceive that the Israelis exploited the treaty and the Egyptians. 

Egyptian-Israeli relations have been strained by a number of issues including the June 1981 Israeli bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon directed against Palestinian forces a year later, the establishment of an increasing number of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the "watering down" of proposals for the autonomy of the Palestinian inhabitants of these territories as envisioned by the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty (Bar-Siman-Tov, 2000). 

For 25 years, Egyptian-Israeli relations have often been characterized by tension. Today, their relationship continues to be frosty. Their peace has survived misperceptions, regional and international political changes, and unanticipated governmental upheavals. Each believes the other has not done enough to stimulate improved understanding or agreement between Israel and her Arab neighbors. However, both are firmly committed to avoid any friction which would threaten continued U.S. aid. 

For Egypt, Israel has moved too slowly to return all the territories captured in the 1967 war and toward the establishment of a Palestinian state. Negative views toward Israel and Israelis are still widely held by Egyptian officials and citizens. Egypt acts both as Arab leader and champion in peaceful conflicts with Israel and equally as a mediator between Israel and Arab parties. 

For Israel, Egypt has been too slow to improve relations and has discouraged other Arab states from doing so. Israelis remain disappointed at the extent of normalization and also the tone of harsh criticism from both Egyptian officials and media organs. They realize that their relationship with Egypt is not going to be like that of the United States and Canada. Perhaps much of public statements from Egyptian sources-while highly objectionable and contrary to a spirit of normalization-may have to be written off as necessary for the management of Egyptian domestic constituencies.' 

It is suspected that neither state seeks a major confrontation with the other. However, it appears that militarized conflict is still in the realm of possibilities. Egypt conducted military operations in preparation for war with Israel in 1996 (Maddy-Weitzman, 1998, 278). They prepared for a military defense of the Suez Canal from a hypothetical northern neighbor which has nuclear and chemical weapons. The Egyptian newspaper al Ahram described the military exercise as a message to Israel that `the end of war does not necessarily mean the achievement of peace , and vice versa' (Maddy-Weitzman, 1998: 278). This clearly indicates that at least the Egyptians have not ruled out the possibility of the use of force as a means of resolving conflicts of interest between the two.

In 2000, Egypt withdrew its ambassadorial representation in Israel to protest the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza strip in what Egyptian officials described as disproportionate response to Palestinian terrorist attacks (New York Times, 2000). 

In short, the Egypt-Israel dyad has displayed the characteristics of the 0.5 level on the peace scale since the end of the militarized portion of its rivalry in 1989. While militarized conflicts have ceased, war plans appear to be present on at least one side in the dyad. Though part of the issues that motivated the rivalry have been resolved the larger issue of Israel's presence appears to continue to impede a warmer peace between the two. A peace treaty has been signed and observed. Finally, for most of the post rivalry period, diplomatic representation has been maintained by both sides in the dyad.

SB-CR:
Egypt / Israel Years: 1948-1979. Issues at stake: Border (Sinai); existence of Israel. End coding: 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 9. Last militarized dispute: 1973. Wars: 1948-1949, 1956, 1967, 1969-1970, 1973. Summary: The rivalry between Israel and Egypt (and its other Arab neighbors) begins in 1948 with Israel's independence from Britain. In 1922 Britain was given a League of Nations mandate over Palestine, following the 1917 Balfour declaration that stated Britain's support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. However, little progress toward the creation of a Jewish state was made until 1947 when Britain turned its responsibility for Palestine over to the United Nations. In November, 1947, the United Nations Committee on Palestine recommended that Palestine be partitioned into 2 parts. A new Jewish state would receive 57% of Palestine's land and have a 58% Jewish population, while the new Arab state would receive 43% of the land and have a 99% Arab population. Jerusalem and Bethlehem would be placed under a United Nations trusteeship. At the time, Jews made up approximately 1/3 of the population of Palestine and owned only about 7% of the land. The UN plan gave the fertile coastal region to the Jewish state, and United Nations' estimates were that the Jewish state would have economic revenues three times that of the new Arab state. Existing Arab states opposed the plan, and threatened fighting if partition was approved, but the UN General Assembly approved the plan 33 to 13 with 10 abstentions. Even before the plan went into effect, Zionists began to extend their control beyond the partition borders; the first Arab-Israeli war began with the invasion of Arab forces into Israel on May 15, 1948, after Israel officially declared its independence on May 14. The rivalry begins with that war. Israel was able to defeat the Arabs in the war, but the resulting map of Israel was quite different from the planned partition of Palestine. Egypt was in control of the Gaza strip, Jordan occupied much of the West Bank of the Jordan River, and Israel had extended its control into the Negev desert in the south and across Galilee in the North. These territorial changes, and the very question of whether Israel was a legitimate state given the way it had come into existence, set the stage for rivalry between Israel and its Arab neighbors for the next 30+ years. Conflict between Israel and Egypt continued through the next 25 years. The dyad is notable for the relatively high frequency of disputes, and more so for the frequency with which those disputes escalated to war. 

In 1956 Israel (with British and French assistance) captured the Sinai, the Gaza strip, and the Suez Canal but was forced to return them to Egypt in the cease-fire that followed. 

In 1967 Israel captured most of the Sinai, the Gaza strip, and advanced to the Suez Canal, keeping the territories and setting the stage for the 1969-1970 War of Attrition and the 1973 Yom Kippur War (October, 1973). 

Following the Yom Kippur War ceasefire in November, 1973, a continuing series of talks began between Egypt (Sadat came to power in 1970) and Israel. In 1974 Israeli forces began a pull back of forces that continued through 1975. In 1975 the two sides signed an interim peace pact in Geneva, and in 1978 the Camp David accords were signed by Sadat and Begin, but it was not until 1979 that a full peace treaty was signed. The treaty agreed to a phased withdrawal to the earlier Israeli and Egyptian borders, with the Gaza strip to remain under Israeli administration until eventually being given autonomy. 

Egypt also took the step of recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, a move which resulted in its alienation from the rest of the Arab World for a decade. Since the signing of the treaty there have been no militarized disputes between Egypt and Israel, although Egypt temporarily withdrew its ambassador from Israel over the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Talks between the two states resumed when Israel pulled out; Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai was completed in 1982, although talks on Gazan autonomy have continued. Further disagreements between the two countries over the terms of the peace agreement have been submitted to arbitration, and arbitration awards have been respected (e.g. the disputed frontier at the Taba, 1986).

Discussion:
MID3915 occurred on June 3, 1989. An issue that had impeded normal relations between Egypt and Israel concerned the disposition of Taba, an approximately 100-hectare border enclave and tourist area on the Gulf of Aqaba in the Sinai Peninsula claimed by the two countries, but occupied by Israel. Following a September 1988 ruling in Egypt's favor by an international arbitration panel, official delegations from Israel and Egypt met to implement the arbitral award. Subsequently this MID occurred. This is a fishing boat incident. An Israeli fisherman was in Egyptian waters near Eliat. The Egyptian Coast Guard warned the man to refrain from fishing in the area. When he did not they fired on him, wounding him.
