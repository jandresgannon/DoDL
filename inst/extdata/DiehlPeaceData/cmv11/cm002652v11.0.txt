TERRMID-NOTES: MID607 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID involving Turkey, allied with the US, Jordan, and Iraq, in a territorial dispute against Syria, allied with Egypt and the USSR. After border troop buildups by Turkey and Syria, clashes occurred along the disputed border. The Egyptians and the Americans were involved heavily in the MID, in the form of arms support and, in the case of Egypt, supplying troops to fight. Russia is involved in this MID due to its support for Syria. Coded not territory here because the US and Egypt did not dispute territory here. See TERRLINK.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID607 from cm narrative, the US and Egypt were pulled into this MID due to their support for the primary disputants, Turkey and Syria. After border troop buildups by Turkey and Syria, clashes occurred along the disputed border. The Egyptians and the Americans were involved heavily in the MID, in the form of arms support and, in the case of Egypt, supplying troops to fight. Coded link to territory because the territorial MID between Turkey and Syria caused a MID between US and Egypt here.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1039 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID involving Jordan, US, and UK vs. Egypt and Syria. Jordan began to crack down on the PLO in the 1970s because the PLO had been attacking Israel from Jordanian territory, causing tension between Jordan and Israel that Jordan did not want. In response, the PLO attempted to depose the king in a civil war. Syria intervened and Egypt provided support on behalf of the militarized anti-regime rebels, and the US and UK supported the Jordanian regime. Coded civil war link because the civil war in Jordan, outside of this dyad, contributed to a MID between US and Syria here.

The US's support for Israel against Syria and Egypt during this territorial MID (specifically over Sinai and Golan Heights) between Israel and Egypt & Syria pulls them into this MID. Coded third party link to territory because the US was a third party to the ISR-SYR territorial dispute.

The US also threatened Syria over its support for the PKK. Coded civil war link because Syria provided support to the PKK, a militarized rebel group involved in civil war activity against Turkey, and that civil war activity is outside of this dyad.

CIVWARLINK: MID4518 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4518 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4518 from cm narrative, part of this MID is due to the US building up troops on the Syrian border in Iraq to prevent terrorists from entering Iraq via Syria. This troop buildup contributed to border clashes. Coded civil war link because this MID was partly caused by the US fighting against terrorist groups that were in Syria, and the terrorists were involved in civil war activity in Iraq.

This MID is largely comprised of border skirmishes between Syrian troops and US/Iraqi border forces, and various border violations and shows of force by US forces hunting Iraqi terrorists in Syria. In April, 2005, US and Iraqi forces clashed with Syrian border troops who were apparently attempting to provide covering fire for terrorists crossing the border into Iraq. Following this incident, the US stepped up its operations in Syrian territory, which resulted in both sides massing troops at the Syrian-Iraqi border to stop crossings from either side. In July 2005, US and Iraqi forces again clashed with Syrian border troops briefly across the border, possibly mistaking the Syrian troops for terrorists. First day of dispute is listed on 6/15/2005 and last day of dispute is listed on 7/22/2005.

An AFP news report says, "Syria has massed troops near the border with Turkey following reports that Ankara was behind four blasts that rocked the country in recent weeks, Al-Hayat daily reported Saturday" (AFP, 6/15/96, 15:10 GMT). Based on this news article, we may suppose concerning ME00065 that Syria first committed a border fortification in reaction to the bomb explosion, accusing Turkey of attempting to kill Abdallah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, who has been sheltered near Damascus in Syria. We may also suppose that Turkey responded by fortifying its border, and the US threatened Syria that it risks confrontation with the American military if Syria goes to War with Turkey.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Syria and the US agreed to resume diplomatic relations on June 16, 1974. US military aircraft attacked Syrian military positions in central Lebanon on December 4, 1983, resulting in the deaths of two Syrian soldiers and one US soldier.

SOURCES-CM: 
*Keesing*, July 1-7, 1974, January 1984.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the US and Syria stems from US support for Israel and Syria's receipt of support from the USSR, from Syrian involvement in Lebanon and from Syrian support for `terrorists' or insurgents in Southern Turkey/Northern Syria (Kurds). 

MID607 is called the Turkey/Syria dispute and occurred from April through November of 1957. It involved Jordan, Iraq, the US, and Turkey versus Syria, Egypt, and the USSR. Some 5,000 Syrian troops entered northern Jordan on April 13, 1957. Jordan closed the border with Syria on April 24, 1957. Syrian troops completed their withdrawal from northern Jordan on May 26, 1957. Foreign Minister Samir al-Rifai of Jordan condemned Syria for anti-Jordanian propaganda on July 6, 1957. The US airlifted military assistance (weapons and ammunition) to Jordan from September 9 to October 6, 1957. The Jordanian government accused Syria of interfering in its domestic affairs on September 19, 1957. Jordan re-opened the border with Syria on October 27, 1957. 

US-Syrian relations were formally severed following the Six Day War in which Syria was a principal participant. 

MID1039 occurred from June through September of 1970. After the Six Day War the PLO began to conduct operations against Israel from Jordan. Israel regularly responded with raids into Jordan. The Jordanians wanted to deescalate the tension with Israel and began to crack down on the PLO in 1970. The PLO responded by attempting to depose King Hussein of Jordan in September of 1970. Fierce fighting took place in Amman and the conflict escalated further when the Syrians intervened. The United States and the UK demonstrated their support for the Jordanian regime suggesting that they would not allow the regime to fall to the PLO or Syrians. 

MID353 is closely associated with the Yom Kippur War and thus occurs in October of 1973. . It covers the indirect confrontation between the US and the USSR. This mid involves the US allied with Israel versus the USSR allied with Egypt and Syria. Here the mid covers the hostilities between the US and the USSR in the conflict and their open support of opposing sides in the Yom Kippur War. The US re-supplied Israel and the USSR re-supplied both Egypt and Syria. 

Following the Yom Kippur War the US resumed formal relations with Syria following the achievement of the Syrian-Israeli disengagement agreement. 

MID3062 occurred from September of 1983 until April of 1984. In this series of exchanges Syrian-United States relations reached a low point. In December 1983, when the two nations engaged in near warfare. On December 4, United States carrier-based warplanes attacked Syrian antiaircraft installations in Lebanon's Biqa Valley (two were shot down), and on December 13 and 14, United States battleships shelled Syrian positions. From a military viewpoint, the clashes were not highly significant. However, they marked the first American-Syrian armed conflict and reinforced Syria's view of the United States regional policy as gunboat diplomacy.

MID4190 took place in June of 1996. Here the Turkish military conducted `war games' on the Syrian border in a threatening manner. It caused a stir in the Middle East and within Syria. The Turkish operations were designed to send a message to the Syrians to stop supporting the Kurdish PKK or Kurdish Worker's Party. The PKK is a separatist group in Turkey the represents the significant Kurdish minority that lives in the Eastern portion of Turkey. The United States joined Turkey in threatening to use military force against Syria if it continued to support `terrorist' insurgents in Turkey. 

At this point, January 2004, it is not clear if the rivalry between the US and Syria is over. The record is mixed with both positive and negative factors in the relationship. In recent years, Syria and the U.S. have worked together in areas of mutual interest. In 1990-91, Syria cooperated with the U.S. as a member of the multinational coalition of forces in the Gulf War. The U.S. and Syria also consulted closely on the Taif Accord, ending the civil war in Lebanon. In 1991, President Asad made a historic decision to accept then President Bushs invitation to attend a Middle East peace conference and to engage in subsequent bilateral negotiations with Israel. Syrias efforts to secure the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon and its lifting of restrictions on travel by Syrian Jews helped further to improve relations between Syria and the United States. There were several presidential summits; the last one occurred when then-President Clinton met the late President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva in March 2000. 

The U.S. continues to have serious differences with Syria, however. Syria has been on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since the lists inception in 1979. Because of its continuing support and safe haven for terrorist organizations, Syria is subject to legislatively mandated penalties, including export sanctions and ineligibility to receive most forms of U.S. aid or to purchase U.S. military equipment. In 1986, the U.S. withdrew its ambassador and imposed additional administrative sanctions on Syria in response to evidence of direct Syrian involvement in an attempt to blow up an Israeli airplane. A U.S. ambassador returned to Damascus in 1987, partially in response to positive Syrian actions against terrorism such as expelling the Abu Nidal Organization from Syria and helping free an American hostage earlier that year. Other issues of U.S. concern include Syrias human rights record and full implementation of the Taif Accord. The principal themes of the bilateral relations include a call for cooperation in the international effort against terrorism, the cessation of support and safe haven for terrorist groups in Syria and Lebanon, cooperation in efforts to forge a comprehensive Middle East peace.

Many experts thought that when President Bashir al-Assad replaced his father in 2001, he would adopt a more pragmatic approach to negotiations with Israel and to internal political and economic reforms. Syrian cooperation with the United States in relation to al-Qaeda terrorists was a positive sign as well for cooperation in other areas. However, most of the issues of contention between the two countries remain despite the change of leadership in the country. 

As of August 2006, the US has Syria listed as an active state sponsor of terror and is suspected of having or previously having a WMD program. In particular, "Syria is cited for providing political and material support (presumably weapons) to both Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups, which also enjoy sanctuary in Syria." In both 2003 and 2004 the US enacted more sanctions against Syria for support of terrorists and for failing to adequately pursue policies aimed at slowing the flow of insurgents form Syria into Iraq. The issues between the US and Syria show no signs of being resolved and, therefore, as of October of 2006 the dyad is coded as an ongoing rivalry (1.0).

PS-NARRATIVE:

19460417-19700610 .25 

In 1945, through pressure from the United States and Britain, France withdrew from Syria. The following year, in 1946, Syria was granted independence. Post World War II, United States interest in the Middle East grew because of oil and concerns over Soviet expansion. The US and Syria were almost immediately at odds when the United States supported the formation of an Israeli state, voting in favor of the United Nations partition plan in 1947 and recognizing the new Israeli government in 1948. The United States also condemned Arab aggression, including Syrian action, in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. To show displeasure at US policy regarding Israel, Syria refused US military and economic aid. This aid was viewed as a bride by western powers to get Arab nations to make peace with Israel. Syria was only willing to accept aid if offered as an unconditional grant. Syria also turned down aid through the Mutual Security Act (MSA), military aid offered by the western powers to Israel and Arab countries on the condition that it is solely for self-defense and that the recipient countries would help defend the world against communist aggression. Syria refused these resources in the 1950s out of the belief the restrictions violated state sovereignty. There were repeated attempts in the 1950s to bring Syria out of neutrality and into the fold with the United States against the Soviet Union and communism. Syria, although interested in US military aid, refused to side with the US because of their policy toward Israel. Syria viewed Israel as a much bigger danger than the Soviet Union and communist influences. 

Between 1954 and 1956, bilateral trade between the Soviet Union and Syria increased dramatically. Tensions between western countries and Syria-Soviet Union heated up in 1956-57 when Syria offered to allow the Soviets and Eastern European countries to finance oil refinery building in Syria. Soviet military aid and equipment also began to flow to Syria during this time. There were also US fears of radicalism in Syria, coupled with rampant rumors of an impending communist coup in the country. Between 1955 and 1957, the United States entertained several plans by opposition groups and the US Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow the Syrian government for fear the government was moving to close to the Soviet Union. The United States instituted the Eisenhower Doctrine in early 1957, which stated that the US would use military resources if necessary to assist countries in maintaining independence against communism. Syria had a strong negative reaction against the application of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, accusing the United States of acting out of its own self-interest not in the interest of any Arab country. In August of 1957, the Syrian government removed from the country three US officials from the US embassy in Damascus, accusing them of participating in a failed CIA plot to overthrow the Syrian government. The accusations of a coup attempt followed only a few days after Syria and the Soviet Union signed a major military aid package worth 570 million dollars.

In October of 1957, Syria and Turkey experienced a series of border clashes. The Soviet Union and Syria accused the United States of instigating the clash by encouraging Turkish aggression against Syria and supplying Turkey with military equipment. The crisis was diffused in November when Turkish troops moved away from the Syrian border but not before the events strengthened further relations between the Syria and the Soviet Union. The two countries signed additional aid packages worth 168 million dollars in late October in reaction to the Syrian-Turkish crisis.

On February 1, 1958, Syria joined Egypt in forming the United Arab Republic. Syria withdrew from the UAR in 1961. During this time, the US and Syria ceased to have diplomatic relations. Although a member of the UAR, and despite Nasser's vehement distrust for the Soviet Union, Syria continued to receive military aid from the Soviet Union during the 1958 to 1961 period.

During the early 1960s US President John F. Kennedy continued overtures started by Eisenhower to provide aid to Syria in exchange for Syria's moderation of policy toward Israel and to align with the US against the Soviet Union. All of these overtures failed. In 1963, due to failed attempts to mend relations with Syria and other Arab countries, Kennedy increased military aid to Israel. Syria later terminated diplomatic relations with the United States in retaliation for giving military assistance to Israel during the 6 Days War of 1967. The rivalry between the United States and Syria begins in the summer of 1970. Relations between the US and Syria from Syria's independence in 1946 to the beginning of the rivalry in 1970 is best characterized by negative peace. There is a consistent level of hostility and distrust between the two countries. The US is fearful during this entire time that Syria will align itself with the Soviet bloc. Syria continually rebuffs attempts by the United States to influence policy, condemns the US for its Israel policy, and, although officially neutral, begins accepting considerable military and economic aid from the Soviet Union. The first MID of RIV92, MID1039 started on June 11, 1970.

Discussion:
MID3062 occurred from September of 1983 until April of 1984. In this series of exchanges Syrian-United States relations reached a low point. In December 1983, when the two nations engaged in near warfare. On December 4, United States carrier-based warplanes attacked Syrian antiaircraft installations in Lebanon's Biqa Valley (two were shot down), and on December 13 and 14, United States battleships shelled Syrian positions. From a military viewpoint, the clashes were not highly significant. However, they marked the first American-Syrian armed conflict and reinforced Syria's view of the United States regional policy as gunboat diplomacy.
