TERRMID-NOTES: MID346 from Gibler 2018, Czechoslovakia threatened to walk out of the World Communist meeting in Budapest in 1968 if Russia did not stop interfering in Czech international affairs. Czechoslovakia's leader had been embracing a more international position, which worried communists in the Soviet Union and in other Soviet-controlled/allied states. The Soviets had been supporting the opposition political party in Czechoslovakia who held a more hard-line, pro-Soviet stance. In June 1968, the opposition party lost in the parliamentary elections, and Soviet tanks, joined by Hungarian, Polish, East German, and Bulgarian forces, arrived in Czechoslovakia and soon thereafter detained the Czech leader. In November, the Soviets forced Czechoslovakia to reorganize their regime and become more closely aligned with Soviet communism. Coded not territory because althuogh this MID involved Soviet/Hungarian/Bulgarian/East German/Polish occupation of Czechoslovakia, this was a regime type issue, not a territorial issue, as the Soviets were ensuring a friendly regime remained in place.
