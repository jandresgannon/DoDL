TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1265 from Gibler (2018), after WWI, several countries, including Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, pressed territorial claims against Hungary, recently broken away from Austria-Hungary. Here, Romania attacked Hungary to claim territory from Hungary, and Yugosloavia, as part of the Allies, allowed this to happen and facilitated the Hungarian surrender of territory to Romania. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute which Yugoslavia became involved in here.

TERRLINK-NOTES: MID3182 from Gibler 2018, Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute after WWI, and a boundary commission was ongoing in 1923. Romania protested several Hungarian incursions into the disputed territory, and minonr clashes occurred. Yugoslavia was Romania's ally, promised to support Romania militarily if war broke out, and then mobilized their forces. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Yugoslavia promised support to Romania in this territorial dispute and mobilized their forces to prepare to attack Hungary.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, this is a multilateral MID pitting US and Yugoslavia against USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in the first few years of the Cold War. The tensions that led to this MID began when Yugoslavia and the USSR began to drift apart in terms of the ruling Yugoslavia Communist Party's willingness to acquiesce to Stalin's directives. The US observed the drift and tried to create an anti-Soviet state in the region by providing economic, food, and military assistance to Yugoslavia, and even attempted to bring Yugoslavia into NATO. Soviet troop mobilizations and border clashes occurred between Yugoslavia and the Soviet-bloc states of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. The US and USSR are also included in this MID since they were rivals providing military assistance and/or orders and the tension was tied to their rivalry. The US considered the USSR's and its allies' behavior threatening during this MID, and the USSR found the US's intervention threatening. Coded not territorial because Yugoslavia and Hungary did not dispute any territory between them, and this was connected to Cold War tensions.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1286 from cm002310 narrative, Stalin attempted to create domestic unrest that would result in an overthrow of the communist government in Yugoslavia and the replacement by a more USSR-friendly communist government. However, the domestic unrest did not result in violence or a militarized rebel group during this MID. Coded not civil war because no militarized anti-government group was present.

TERRMID-CER: MID1703 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1703 from Gibler 2018, this is a Cold WAr MID that began when Yugoslavia began to pull away from Stalinist Communism in Europe. The Yugoslavian leader, Marshall Tito, began enacting and arguing for policies in the interest of Yugoslavia rather than the Socialist Union as a whole. In 1952, Yugoslavia fortified its border with Hungary fearing an attack, protested that Soviet airplanes violated its airspace, and accused Bulgaria of espionage. Romania accused Yugoslavia of violating their airspace, and Hungary protested that Yugoslavia destroyed two bridges linking their territories. Tensions eventually died down. Coded not territory because this was connected to Cold War tensions, and Yugoslavia and Hungary were not disputing territory here.

This is a one incident dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary. During this MID, Hungary placed its border guards (along the Yugoslav border) on high alert. Since Hungary was allowing NATO to use their airspace to bomb the Bosnian Serbs, Hungary feared a possible reprisal by Yugoslavia.

In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99. First day of dispute was on 3/9/1999 and last day of dispute was on 3/20/1999.

This dispute deals with the relationship between NATO and Yugoslavia. At this time KFOR was patrolling the border between Kosovo and Yugoslavia, but a number of rebels from Kosovo were continuing to infiltrate into Yugoslavia and attack Serb police officers. Yugoslavia originally moved forces to the border to counter the actions by the Kosovars and this was met with a NATO threat. First day of dispute was on 2/21/2000 and last day of dispute was on 4/3/2000.

NARRATIVE-CM:

Hungarian and Yugoslav representatives signed the *Treaty of Trianon* on June 4, 1920, which provided for Yugoslav sovereignty over Croatia and Vojvodina. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania formed an alliance against Hungary on August 14-17, 1920. Hungary asked the* League of Nations* (LON) Council to confirm a delimitation commission ruling on its boundary with Yugoslavia in the territory north of the Mur river on July 2, 1922. On July 20, 1922, the LON Council requested that the LON secretariat investigate the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia, and requested that the secretariat make recommendations for a settlement. On September 30, 1922, the LON Council suspends its efforts to resolve the dispute after failing to get Yugoslavia's cooperation. Fifteen Hungarians were killed by Yugoslav border guards in May 1934. Hungary referred the matter to the LON Council on May 8, 1934. Hungarian and Yugoslav representatives signed an agreement on July 21, 1934. King Alexander of Yugoslavia was assassinated by a Macedonian with a Hungarian passport in Marseilles, France on October 8, 1934. The Yugoslav government referred the matter to the LON Council on November 22, 1934, and Hungary denied any involvement in the assassination on November 24, 1934. Yugoslavia began deporting ethnic-Hungarians from its territory on December 5, 1934. The LON facilitated an end to the crisis on December 10, 1934. Hungarian and Yugoslav representatives signed a non-aggression pact on December 12, 1940. German troops and Hungarian troops invaded Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941, and Hungarian troops occupied 11,475 square kilometers of Yugoslav territory on April 14, 1941. Hungarian troops killed some 3,000 Serbs and Jews in Novi Sad in the Yugoslav region of Vojodina on January 21-23, 1942. Hungary and the Allied countries signed a ceasefire agreement in Moscow on January 20, 1945, which provided for Hungarian compensation to Yugoslavia. Soviet troops occupied Budapest on February 13, 1945. Hungarian and Yugoslav representatives signed a peace treaty in Paris on February 10, 1947. Hungarian troops and Yugoslav troops clashed near the border on October 27-28, 1949. Hungary resumed diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia on August 31, 1953.

NARRATIVE-CR:

The first two disputes between Yugoslavia and Austria-Hungary began in 1914 and was part of the larger issue of the First World War (MID257). MID1265 and MID3182 are both related to Yugoslavia siding on the side of the Allied forces and the reparations following the First World War. Following WWI (November 11th of 1918, the date of the armistice between Germany and the Allied Powers) the disputes were effectively ended with the Treaty of Versailles which called for the dissection of the Austria-Hungarian Empire (Nicolson 2001). The Austro-Hungarian Empire was entirely dismantled, and a new nation of Czechoslovakia was formed.

The dispute in 1938 came about when the Germany incorporated Austria into its empire (MID1245). Hungary being incorporated into Germany who shared a border with Yugoslavia and required permission to occupy with troops. Permission was denied, but the conflict was resolved when Yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact in 1940, joining Germany and Italy (Clodfelter 1992). This agreement was nullified when a regime change occurred and Yugoslavia joined the Allied powers in March of 1940 (MID3813). Resolution came about with the end of the Second World War and the German Empire was divided into occupied zones and autonomy was returned to Austria (Clodfelter 1992). 

A new issue arose in August of 1949 with the rise of the communist party in Yugoslavia and the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform countries (Stavrianos 2000). Austria and Yugoslavia had disagreement regarding the return of German property from WWII. A first agreement was signed in 1951 (MID1286), ending the first disagreement over reparations. A second reform in Yugoslavia in 1953 with the drafting of a new communist constitution and the appointment of Tito (MID1703). Yugoslavia and Austria tried to resolve their disagreement over the seizure of land of Austrian citizens in the border zone. Final resolution did not occur until 1955 with the Austrian State Treaty (Grenville 1980). This final treaty resolved the issue of reparations and effectively ended all past rivalries. 

The final rivalry began in 1991 with the escalating war in Yugoslavia. Several violations of the Yugoslav-Austria border resulted in an Hungarian military operation on the border (MID3977). In 1994 (MID4332) Hungary in support of UN intervention deployed peace-keeping troops in response to Milosevic's ethnic war against Bosnians (www.onwar.com 2003). MID4102, MID4137 and MID4186 all involved treatment of ethnic Austrians in the Yugoslav region. The rivalry is ongoing. 

MID3977 Inovles violation of Hungarian airspace and border by Yugoslavia between August 22, 1991 and September 19, 1991. Hungary protested the violation, stepped up land and air patrols and increased border security with 150 troops.

MID4332 This is a one incident dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary and takes place in February 1994. During this MID, Hungary placed its border guards (along the Yugoslav border) on high alert. Since Hungary was allowing NATO to use their airspace to bomb the Bosnian Serbs, Hungary feared a possible reprisal by Yugoslavia.

MID4102 This incident takes place between Yugoslavia and Hungary from August 1995 to February 1996. Reports indicate that both states fortified their border.

MID4137 occurred from February of 1998 until June of 1999. This is the conflict in Kosovo. After years of rising tensions, in March of 1998, fighting erupts in Kosovo between the majority Albanians and Serbs and within months some 350,000 people have been displaced or fled abroad. In October, 1998, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and partial pull-out of Yugoslav forces and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe sent the first of 2,000 `verifiers' to monitor the agreement. In February, 1999, talks were held in Rambouillet, France, but discussions broke down and tensions and repressions rise again in Kosovo. In March, 1999, after repeated warnings, NATO launched its 78-day air war. Within three days, ethnic Albanians began to arrive in neighboring Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in huge numbers, walking, on tractor-trailers and by car. Authorities expel thousands of persons by special `refugee trains' to Macedonia, virtually emptying all major towns, such as Pristina, of Albanians. From April-May 1999, International agencies, governments and a special humanitarian task force from NATO called AFOR begin to construct dozens of camps for refugees in anticipation they will spend many months in exile. Some 444,600 refugees flee to Albania, 244,500 to Macedonia and 69,900 to Montenegro. Because of political pressures on the Macedonian government, more than 90,000 Albanians are airlifted to 29 countries for temporary safety. On June 3, 1999, Yugoslavia accepted a peace plan requiring withdrawal of all forces from Kosovo and the entry of peacekeepers under a U.N. mandate. On June 12, 1999, Russian and NATO forces entered Kosovo. 

MID4186 occurs in the aftermath of the conflict in Kosovo and are related to the withdrawal of forces from Kosovo and the lingering hostility between NATO forces and Serbia as Milosovic tried to hold on to power in his last few months in office. 

MID4343 started on November 24, 2000 and lasted until November 28, 2000. The Serbian Interior Ministry said in a statement on November 24, that NATO must stop "terrorists" from entering Serbia from Kosovo by the evening of 27 November. If the infiltration and attacks continue, Serbian police will enter the 5-kilometer buffer zone along the border with Kosovo "with the means that are available," Bozo Prelevic said. He is one of three interior ministers in the transitional Serbian government. On 27 November, however, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic said near Bujanovac that the deadline is "simply postponed" indefinitely to give diplomacy a chance. AP reported, however, that a military buildup is under way on either side. NATO has called on the two sides to show restraint. This whole MID was over the deadline and the threat to use violence Serbian police gave NATO forces.

MID1703, lasting from June-October 1953, marks the last dispute of RIV812. Soviet and Hungarian forces invade Yugoslavia in 1941 and Hungary occupies a portion of Yugoslavia for the remainder of the war. The two countries sign a peace treaty in February of 1947 but still experienced a brief border clash in October of 1949. Hungary resumed diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia on August 31, 1953.

MID1703, lasting from June-October 1953, marks the last dispute of RIV812. Soviet and Hungarian forces invade Yugoslavia in 1941 and Hungary occupies a portion of Yugoslavia for the remainder of the war. The two countries sign a peace treaty in February of 1947 but still experienced a brief border clash in October of 1949. The two countries officially resume diplomatic relations in August of 1953. During much of the Cold War, Hungary's independent foreign policy interests are subordinated to those of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's essentially speaks for the Hungarian government; this is especially the case after the Soviet Union crushed the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Indeed, the Soviet Union maintained a military presence in Hungary from 1956 until the last Soviet soldier left the country in 1991. Soviet Union control over Hungarian foreign policy suppresses any disagreements that might have lingered between Hungary and Yugoslavia. Indeed, very little of significance occurs between these two states during the Cold War. The issues of disagreement between these two states and the resulting rivalry reemerge almost immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the two states do not experience any militarized disputes during the period after diplomatic relations are resumed (1953) and final resolution coming with the signing of the Austrian State Treaty in May 1955; thus, relations from 1955 to 1991 are best characterized as 0.5.

RIV813 is related to the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the resulting aftermath. RIV813 begins with MID3977 and MID4343 is the last dispute. The rivalry has two parts; the first involves disagreements between Yugoslavia and Hungary; the second involves the NATO operation against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict. The conclusion of the Cold War and the resulting destabilization of Yugoslavia creates security concerns for Hungary. Hungary's sympathetic view toward independence movements in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia created some tensions between the countries. As well, relations deteriorated in 1991 when Serbia learned that Hungary had sold weapons to Croatia in 1990. This revelation caused negotiations between Yugoslavia and Hungary for a bilateral military cooperation agreement to breakdown and Serbia openly accused Hungary of interfering in Yugoslavian affairs. Yugoslavia and Hungary experienced MID3977, MID4103 and MID4332 from 1991 to 1996; disputes involve Yugoslavia's violation of Hungarian airspace and border, as well as treatment of ethnic minorities. In 1991, a Yugoslavian military aircraft bombed a Hungarian village. This incident resulted in the mobilization of the Hungarian military and the reinforcement of troops on the border. Later, Hungary and Yugoslavia experience MID4137, MID4186 and MID4343; these are part of the NATO air war against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo conflict and the aftermath of that war. 

The rivalry between the Hungary and Serbia-Montenegro (What is left of the former Yugoslavia) appears to be over. Milosovic's removal from office would appear to mark an important change in relatoins between Serbia and NATO countries. Milosovic's rejection of claims of a first-round opposition victory in new elections for the Federal presidency in September 2000 led to mass demonstrations in Belgrade on October 5 and the collapse of the regime's authority. The opposition's candidate, reformed nationalist Vojislav Koštunica took office as Yugoslav president on October 6.

RIV813 is effectively over with the end of the Kosovo war and the removal of Milosovic from power. On April 1, 2001, Milosovic was arrested on charges of abuse of power and corruption. On June 28 he was extradited to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. His trial on charges of genocide in Bosnia and war crimes in Croatia and Kosovo began at The Hague on February 12, 2002. On April 11, the Yugoslav parliament passed a law allowing extradition of all persons charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal. In March 2002, the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to dissolve FRY in favour of a new, much weaker form of cooperation called "Serbia and Montenegro". By order of Yugoslav Federal Parliament on February 4, 2003, Yugoslavia ceased to exist.

In the years following the Kosovo War and the removal of Milosovic from power, Hungary and Yugoslavia work toward rebuilding relations and resolving those contentious issues that influenced the rivalry. 

November 20000: Hungary declares a willingness to help Yugoslavia recover from the Kosovo war and rebuild relations in the aftermath of the October 5 revolution. Tensions do still exist, however, over the disposition of ethnic minorities.

2004: Hungarian minorities living in the Vojvodian region in Serbia reported being attacked and harassed by Serbians; Hungary admitted that they did not think the Serbian government was involved by nevertheless asked the Serbian government to do a better job of protecting the minorities. 

September 2004: Hungary and Serbia-Montenegro ratified an agreement aimed at protecting the rights of Hungarian minorities in Serbia and the rights of Serbians in Hungary.

March 24, 2006: Hungary and Serbia set up an intergovernmental commission aimed at promoting all areas of cooperation; this was a followup to the commission established in 2004 to oversee treatment of ethnic minorities. 

Relations between the two countries following the removal of Milosovic from power are best characterized by negative peace (0.5).
