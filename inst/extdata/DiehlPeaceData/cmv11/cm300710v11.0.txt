CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID31 from cm200710 narrative, this is one of two MIDs connected to the Boxer Rebellion. Conservative opponents of reform in China gave support to anti-foreign and anti-Christian secret societies. In 1900, Boxers attacked Christians throughout the countryside, leading to intervention by several Western/foreign powers, who defeated China in a war. Coded civil war MID because Chinese support to secret groups militarized them and led to widespread violence against Western interests, leading to Western intervention, including Austria-Hungary here.
