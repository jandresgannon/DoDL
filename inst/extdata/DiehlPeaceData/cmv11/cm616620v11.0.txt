CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID3016 from Gibler 2018, Libya was providing support for rebels attacking the Tunisian government. In response, France deployed ships off the Tunisian coast as a show of force against Libya. Coded civil war MID because this was connected to militarized rebel activity in Tunisia, a state in this dyad. Coded uncertain because Gibler does not consider Tunisia a party to this dispute; rather, he interprets this as a bilateral MID between France and Libya. This MID is the show of force to stop rebel support, not the rebel attacks themselves.

According to the NTYT, this appears to be in response for Libya expelling 20,000 Tunisian workers just before the events of this MID. Libya may have then violated Tunisian airspace, and Tunisia put its forces on alert. Coded not territory because this was connected to economics/espionage, and no boundary dispute was present.

NARRATIVE-CM:
President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia accused Libya of subversion on March 22, 1976, and ordered the expulsion of three Libyan diplomats on March 23, 1976. Tunisia recalled its ambassador from Libya on March 22, 1976. President Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries on April 23-25, 1976. Tunisia protested the capture by Libyan troops of three Tunisian soldiers near the border on April 25, 1976. Libya and Tunisia submitted a maritime boundary dispute (Gulf of Gabes) to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on December 1, 1978. Some 250 Libyan-trained insurgents attacked the Tunisian town of Gafsa on January 26-27, 1980, resulting in the deaths of 41 individuals. Tunisia appealed for diplomatic, economic, and military assistance from Western and Arab countries. France sent military transport planes and military advisors to Tunisia on January 28, 1980, and deployed eight warships off the Libyan/Tunisian coast on January 30, 1980. Tunisia expelled the Libyan ambassador from Tunisia on January 30, 1980. Defense Secretary Harold Brown of the United States announced that he would expedite the delivery of armored vehicles, and the armored vehicles were sent to Tunisia on February 7, 1980. Libya and Tunisia referred the matter to the *Organization of African Unity* (OAU) in February 1980. Libya demanded the withdrawal of French forces from Tunisia on February 12, 1980, and France withdrew its forces from Tunisia on February 13, 1980. The *League of Arab States* (LAS) established a four-member conciliation commission (Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria) on February 28, 1980. On April 12, 1980, Tunisia executed 15 individuals who had participated in the Gafsa attack. The ICJ issued its decision on February 24, 1982, which established the maritime border between Libya and Tunisia. Libyan and Tunisian troops clashed near the border in May 1984. Libya ordered the expulsion of some 30,000 Tunisian workers in the country. LAS Secretary-General Chadli Klibi attempted to mediate negotiations between the parties on August 14-16, 1985. Tunisia expelled some 280 Libyans from the country on August 20-21, 1985, and placed its military on alert on the border on August 22, 1985. Morocco attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries on August 24-25, 1985. Kuwait attempted to mediate negotiations between the countries on August 24-September 1, 1985. President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria expressed support for Tunisia on September 2, 1985. Tunisia severed economic relations with Libya on September 2, 1985, and severed diplomatic relations with Libya on September 26, 1985.

On August 27, 1985, the United States affirmed its support for Tunisia's security, amid a sharp rise in tension between that North African country and neighboring Libya. Tunisia, which has longstanding ties to the United States, asserted that Libyan fighter planes had violated its airspace and that Libya had massed forces along the Tunisian-Libyan frontier, after days of charges and counter-charges. Today, the State Department said Washington stood by a pledge made by President Reagan to President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia on June 18, 1985, at the White House of American backing for Tunisia's security and territorial integrity. The latest tensions between Libya and Tunisia arose two weeks before when Libya suddenly ordered the expulsion of Tunisian workers, many of whom had been there for years. So far, about 23,000 Tunisians have been forced over the border into Tunisia, many of them without their property and documents. Smaller numbers of Egyptians and other foreign nationals have also been expelled from Libya. The official Libyan explanation was that this was done for economic reasons because of the drop in Libya's oil revenues. In retaliation, Tunisia has expelled more than 200 Libyans from Tunisia, accusing them of subversion. But Tunisian officials have said that they regarded the Libyan moves as part of a broader plan by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, to subvert Tunisia, whose President is in 82 years old and in poor health. On several occasions, Colonel Qaddafi has talked of uniting Tunisia to Libya. Because of previous tensions between the two countries, the United States has in recent years become an arms supplier to Tunisia, selling Tunisia a dozen F-5 fighters, M-60 tanks and C-130 transport planes. When Mr. Bourguiba was in Washington in June, the main concern of the Tunisian side was what it felt was the threat from Libya. The United States has pledged repeatedly since President Reagan took office that it would help any nation threatened by Libya. American officials said that they do not believe that Libya is actually planning an outright invasion of Tunisia, but that Colonel Qaddafi does seem interested in seeking to cause turmoil there. They said that Colonel Qaddafi seems to have been heartened by his one-year-old treaty of union with Morocco, despite Morocco's ties to the United States, and by the friendly relations he has struck with the new military Government in the Sudan.

On September 25, 1985, Tunisia has severed diplomatic relations with Libya after a month of mounting disagreements with the government of Col. Moammar Khadafy, officials reported. President Habib Bourguiba's government accused Libya of sending two letter bombs to Tunisian journalists this week, and expelled four Libyan diplomats for "their aggressive threats" against Tunisian reporters. Libya has denied the charges. In Tripoli, the official Libyan news agency JANA said that the letter-bomb charges were "fabricated ... by the Tunisian security, information and political authorities." It called them "a counterfeit of truths." Military forces reportedly are on alert in both countries. In breaking diplomatic relations, the Tunisian government also declared a halt to air service between the North African neighbors, according to the officials, who refused to be identified in accordance with government policy. In August, Libya expelled the first group of an estimated 30,000 Tunisian workers out of the country. Tunisia, which suffers high employment, accused Libya of trying to destabilize its economy. Libya has frequently threatened retaliation for what it calls Tunisia's newspaper "campaign of lies." Tunisian officials said several letter bombs addressed to journalists had been uncovered. One exploded in a Tunis post office, causing severe injuries, and another blew up in the city's old quarter, causing no injuries, they said. Tunisia previously froze commercial relations with Libya and accused it of violating Tunisian air space. The United States, France and Egypt have warned Libya not to interfere in Tunisian affairs. Tunisia's Foreign Ministry also filed a formal protest alleging that four Mirage jets of the Libyan air force violated Tunisian air space.

Tunisia recalled its ambassador from Libya on March 22, 1976. Tunisia protested the capture by Libyan troops of three Tunisian soldiers near the border on April 25, 1976. 

In 1977, relations between Tunisia and Libya worsened over the disputed waters in the Gulf of Gabes. An Italian owned oil rig working for Libya had been removed from the area under Tunisian protest. On June 2, 1977, Libyan leader Col. Qadaffi claimed the area as Libyan waters. On June 10, the two countries agreed to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice. This was MID3014.

Libya and Tunisia submitted a maritime boundary dispute (Gulf of Gabes) to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on December 1, 1978. It was this maritime dispute that was at the heart of the rivalry between the two countries, as well as Col. Qadaffi of Libya's continued interventions into the domestic affairs of surrounding states that created a sense of threat on the part of Tunisia.

Some 250 Libyan-trained insurgents attacked the Tunisian town of Gafsa on January 26-27, 1980, resulting in the deaths of 41 individuals. France sent military transport planes and military advisors to Tunisia on January 28, 1980, and deployed eight warships off the Libyan/Tunisian coast on January 30, 1980.

Libya demanded the withdrawal of French forces from Tunisia on February 12, 1980, and France withdrew its forces from Tunisia on February 13, 1980. This ended MID3016. On April 12, 1980, Tunisia executed 15 individuals who had participated in the Gafsa attack. 

MID3632 was the result of Col. Qadaffi's intervention into the Chadian civil war in December of 1980, and the perception of threat on the part of Tunisia. Tunisia responded by declaring a state of emergency on its eastern frontiers.

The ICJ issued its decision on February 24, 1982, which established the maritime border between Libya and Tunisia. 

Libyan and Tunisian troops clashed near the border in May 1984. Libya ordered the expulsion of some 30,000 Tunisian workers in the country.

Tunisia became independent on March 20, 1956. Libya became independent on December 24, 1951. 

A treaty of friendship was signed on January 6, 1957 between Tunisia and Libya. Habib Bourguiba, the Tunisian Prime Minister said that the treaty represents the cornerstone of North Africa unity. 

Tunisia and Libya were two of the four North African countries which on November 28, 1964 signed an accord that led to the creation of the Maghreb Economic Community. The Ministers of Economy agreed for the need to establish free trade and harmonize their economies.

On January 12, 1974, the leaders of Libya and Tunisia, Ghaddafi and Bourguiba announced that they reached an agreement to unite their two countries into a new nation. The new nation will be known as the Arab Islamic Republic and would have one constitution and president, a single flag and one army. In 1972, Ghaddafi proposed another union of Tunisia but Bourguiba rejected the proposal then. 

On March 30, 1974 the proposed merger became a dead idea in the view of knowledgeable political and diplomatic circles. Bourguiba said earlier in March 1974 that merger was not an option, even though he signed the agreement to unite the two countries back in January. Libya became resentful toward Tunisia and threw out of the country 1,000 Tunisian workers. 

President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia accused Libya of subversion on March 22, 1976, and ordered the expulsion of three Libyan diplomats on March 23, 1976. Tunisia recalled its ambassador from Libya on March 22, 1976. Tunisia protested the capture by Libyan troops of three Tunisian soldiers near the border on April 25, 1976. This is the onset of RIV1174.

19870924-20159999 0.5

The last MID of RIV1174, MID2540, ended on August 22, 1985. On September 24, 1987, Libya and Tunisia signed a protocol in Tripoli to strengthen cooperation between the two countries. The protocol, signed by Libyan secretary of public employment Fawzi al Shakshuki and the visiting Tunisian social affairs minister al-Hadi al-Baccouche, includes the cooperation in the fields of social affairs, labor service, banks and joint corporations. Al-Baccouche is the first Tunisian minister to visit Libya since Tunisia severed diplomatic relations with Libya in 1985, after 30,000 Tunisian workers had been driven out of Libya. The relations between the two countries have been improving since the beginning of 1987. Late July 1987, the aviation companies of the two countries began to resume the airlines linking Tripoli and Tunis, the capitals of the two countries.

On December 29, 1987, Tunisia restored full diplomatic relations with Libya after receiving millions of dollars in compensation for financial losses suffered by 33,000 Tunisian workers expelled by Tripoli more than two years ago.
The renewal of full contacts also included the reciprocal reopening of consulates in the two North African capitals, leaving only the exchanging of ambassadors to complete the process. A statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the decision by Tunisia and Libya followed ''positive developments on the level of bilateral relations'' and reflected a ''common desire to create the conditions for a fruitful cooperation in various domains.'' It was the first major diplomatic decision by the new government of Tunisian Prime Minister Hedi Bakouche, installed in October after the removal of the aging President Habib Bourguiba. But the diplomatic rapprochement, initiated under Bourguiba, did not appear to signal any change of direction in Tunisian foreign policy under his successor, President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali. For Libya, the rapprochement means a lessening of its isolation within the Arab world and a step toward joining the friendship pact linking Tunisia, Algeria and Mauritania. Libya also needs Tunisian permission for a cross-border gas pipeline project. For Tunisia, it means the resumption of lucrative export trade with a close and relatively wealthy neighbor, and a chance to ease domestic pressures from unemployment by sending workers abroad. Libya's official radio and JANA news service both said Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi received a telephone call Monday from the Tunisian president informing him of the decision to restore ties. Ben Ali ''informed the brother leader of the revolution that the political bureau of the Tunisian (ruling Socialist Destourien) Party has convened and it has decided to restore brotherly relations between Tunisia and the great Jamahiriyah (Libya) to their normality,'' Libyan radio said in a broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. As a condition for resuming relations, Tunisia had demanded that Libya pay about $120 million in compensation for workers' losses of property and earnings in the September 1985 expulsions. Officials in Tunis refused to say how much of this actually was paid or pledged by Tripoli. But Libya is known to have made at least one payment of $10 million earlier this year. Despite the move, officials said Tunisia probably will remain highly cautious in its future relations with Libya-with whose mercurial leader it has had all too many such quarrels and reconciliations. Foreign Ministry officials suggested Tunisia is likely to balance its re-launched friendship with Libya by re-establishing the diplomatic relations with Egypt that it broke off when President Anwar Sadat made peace with Israel in 1979.

Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said on April 4, 1988, that he was dismantling a military unit that was created to act inside Tunisia if the United States used that country to attack Libya, the Libyan news agency reported.

JANA, monitored in Rome, said Gadhafi also told the visiting Tunisian prime minister and Cabinet that he ordered a division of troops withdrawn from the border with Tunisia. The troops were sent to the border prior to the new Tunisian government's taking power on November 7, 1987, because Gadhafi believed the United States intended to use Tunisia to attack Libya, the agency said. Prime Minister Hedi Baccouche of Tunisia and his country's Council of Ministers came to Libya for talks with Libya's Cabinet. Gadhafi said he also will insist on "opening the artificial borders with Egypt" and withdrawing military forces from that frontier as part of his quest for a unified Arab nation. JANA quoted Gadhafi as telling the meeting, "To bolster confidence, fraternity, security and safety among the brothers in Libya and Tunisia, I announce the dismantling of the 'Badr' formation, which was to act inside Tunisian Arab territories if America used ... (Tunisia) against Libya." He was quoted as saying the formation's weapons were being presented "as a gift to the Tunisian Arab armed forces." He hailed the Tunisians who came to power on November 7, 1987, as being "among those who prevented America from using Tunisian Arab territories against Libya," the agency said. He was referring to the removal of 84-year-old President Habib Bourguiba, who made Tunisia one of the most Westernized nations in the Arab world. Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an army general and then the prime minister, said in November that Bourguiba was incapacitated by age and health and cited a constitutional provision in taking power. Ben Ali now is Tunisian president. Gadhafi also said he was abolishing the border gate with Tunisia. Starting Monday, "Arabs in both Libya and Tunisia can enter and go out without this gate standing in their way," JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying. He expressed regret that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt "had rejected the opening of the borders" and said he would send a letter to Egyptian parties and organizations demanding the border be opened, the agency reported. "Whoever refuses to open the borders means that he has not will at hand, or reflects his fear for the Zionists and the Americans who fill Egypt's streets," JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying. "If the present Egyptian rulers are unable to achieve these unionist proposals, others will achieve them. Victory will be for these proposals. As for those who oppose them, they will end in the dustbin of history."

Tunisian president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali arrived to Tripoli on August 6, 1988, for a three-day official visit to Libya at the invitation of Libyan leader Omar Muammar Gaddafi. Ben Ali is the first Tunisian head of state to visit the neighboring country since September, 1985 when the two countries severed their diplomatic relations after Libya ousted about 30,000 Tunisian workers. The official ties were resumed in December 1987, soon after Ben Ali took power as new president of Tunisia. 

On May 23, 1988, Tunisia and Libya were satisfied with the cooperation between the two countries and the development of relations between Maghreb countries following the restoration of Tunisian-Libyan diplomatic ties. This was expressed by both Tunisian president Ben Ali and Libyan leader Muammar Ghadafi at their talks held the previous night. Tunisian Prime Minister Hedi Baccouche visited Libya in April 1988 and a cooperation pact covering political, economic and cultural relations were signed between the two countries.

Libya reopened its border with Tunisia on November 16, 1993, after a 24-hour closure to protest new United Nations sanctions over the Lockerbie airliner bombing, travelers and officials said. On November 14, 1993, the official Libyan news agency JANA reported sit-in protests against the sanctions by local assemblies in Ras Ajdir, on the road to the Libyan capital, Tripoli.

A border crossing row between Libya and Tunisia appeared stalemated on November 15, 1994, as Libya refused to issue medical certificates which Tunisia said it required from some foreigners wishing to leave. Libya will not give foreigners bound for Tunisia certificates required by the authorities there that they are not suffering from plague, the Libyan health minister Baghdadi Al-Mahmudi, told AFP. "It's impossible to issue such certificates because there are no cases of plague or any other contagious illness in Libya," Al-Mahmudi told AFP by telephone from Tripoli. Al-Mahmudi said that the World Health Organization had confirmed the absence of plague in Libya. Tunisia has only one border crossing with Libya, at the southern town of Ras Jedir. Tunisia has required foreigners from Libya to produce certificates that they are not suffering from plague "issued by Libyan medical authorities." A diplomat holding a certificate signed by an embassy doctor was refused entry to Tunisia because border guards said the requirement was for a certificate from "hospitals or the Libyan health ministry", diplomatic sources said. Libyan border authorities have for two weeks imposed a requirement that foreigners from some African countries, including Tunisia, hold cholera vaccination certificates. Some observers believe the new Tunisian measure may be in retaliation for the Libyan requirement. Tunisia lifted a ban imposed earlier on foreigners entering or leaving Libya via Ras Jedir. But customs officials began turning back foreigners other than citizens from the Arab Maghreb Union-Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania-on the grounds they were not holding certificates showing they were plague-free. Libya has been subjected to an international air embargo since 1992 and its only practicable land frontiers are through Egypt and Tunisia. Western diplomatic sources in Tunis said the Tunisian moves would dissuade Western businessmen, particularly Europeans, from travelling to Libya via Tunisia. But many people would be put off by the alternative through Egypt which involves a grueling 2,000 kilometers, (1,250 mile) drive to reach Tripoli, the sources said.

Libyan leader Moamer Gaddafi arrived on October 28, 1996, in Tunisia on a "friendship and working visit" lasting several days, Tunisian radio reported. During talks with Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, Gaddafi will discuss improvement of economic ties and recent developments in the Maghreb region, according to the report. Both Tunisia and Libya are members of the Union of Arab Maghreb states including Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. Libya is facing severe economic difficulties after the United Nations imposed sanctions including an air embargo in 1992 after Tripoli refused to extradite two suspects believed to have been involved in the bombing of a PanAm jumbo jet. The attack on the U.S. airliner over the Scottish city of Lockerbie in 1988 claimed the lives of 270 people. Gaddafi has offered to extradite the suspects to a neutral country. The U.S. stepped up its pressure on Libya earlier this year when U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a law that would impose sanctions on any company investing in countries supporting terrorism. Apart from Libya the list of countries includes Iran, Iraq and Sudan. Tunisia has tried to mediate on the diplomatic level in the crisis between Libya and "certain Western nations," Tunisian press reports said. Tunisia had increased bilateral contacts with friendly western partners and in the framework of international organizations on the issue, the reports said.

Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali was expected on August 16, 1998, in Tripoli for a "working and friendship" visit. The radio, monitored from Tripoli quoted the Tunisian foreign ministry as saying the visit of unspecified duration aims at strengthening relations between the two neighbors. It takes place six days after that of the Tunisian Prime Minister, Ahmed Karaoui, who along with his Libyan counterpart, Mohammed Mangouche, chaired the Libya-Tunisia joint cooperation committee last Tuesday in Tripoli. Tunisia and Libya had decided to raise the volume of trade between them to 300 million US dollars annually. They have also established joint projects on energy, agriculture, electricity and light industries. All these came in the wake of the official visit of the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi to Tunis in 1996. 

According to reports reaching Tripoli on November 8, 1998, a 225 KV high voltage line will installed to link certain Libyan and Tunisian power stations. Under the project to be executed during 30 months, over 300 MW is to be exchanged between the two countries. The agreement constitutes an important step in the planned inter-connection of electrical grids with the Maghreb Arab Union, whose member countries are Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia.

On February 18, 1999, Libya's Secretary-General of the General People's Assembly (or Prime Minister) Mohammed al-Mankoush, has met with his Tunisian counterpart Hamed Karaoui to discuss consolidating cooperation between the two countries. Al-Mankoush called ''for defining and overcoming challenges by giving priority to vital and strategic projects'' and for affirming cooperation in economic, social, cultural and information fields. The meeting, which took place in the Libyan city of Sirte and was attended by ministers from both countries, tackled ways to develop and strengthen bilateral ties. Speaking during the opening of the 12th session of the Tunisian-Libyan Higher Cooperation Follow-up Committee, he also emphasized the need ''for a civilized and balanced dialogue as well as equitable ties in the Mediterranean region based on mutual respect away from military alliances and intervention in the countries' internal affairs.'' He praised Tunisia for backing Libya's participation in the dialogue among the Mediterranean countries and the Arab-European cooperation partnership. For his part, Karaoui said the committee meetings meant to explore ways for consolidating bilateral ties and removing obstacles to cooperation between the two countries.

Libya and Tunisia agreed to create a free trade zone, according to a joint statement issued on June 4, 2000, following a two-day summit meeting in Tripoli between the Tunisian president and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. The North African neighbors also agreed to double their trade volume to one billion dollars per year, and to the ''immediate restart'' of flights between the two countries, the statement said. U.N. air sanctions against Libya were suspended last year with the country's decision to hand over two suspects for trial in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Libya is Tunisia's leading economic partner in Africa. The visit to Tripoli by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was aimed at drawing a renewed Libyan commitment to the United Arab Maghreb, known as UMA, made up of the five North African nations Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. The UMA has languished since its creation in 1988, and Libya has worked to extend its ties with other parts of Africa. However, during the summit, the two countries said a united Maghreb, or North Africa, is an ''irreversible strategic choice toward the edification of an Arab Maghreb without borders.'' The two leaders called for a North African summit ''as early as possible,'' the statement said. Tunisia and Morocco have had a free trade zone for nearly a year. The leaders of Libya and Tunisia also called for an end to combat between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and called for dialogue between the UMA and other regional groupings, like the European Union to make the Mediterranean region a ''lake of peace,'' the statement said.

On July 23, 2000, the Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi of Tunisia and the Director-General of the Libyan foreign investment agency, Mouhamed Ali el Houij, in Tunis, discussed bilateral cooperation and joint venture opportunities. Ghannouchi and El Houij also pledged to intensify contacts and meetings between businessmen and promoters from the two countries in order to identify joint projects and to consolidate ties between them. Meanwhile, a report on the proceedings published in Tunis at the end of discussions between the Tunisian minister of foreign affairs, Habib Ben Yahia and the secretary of the Libyan People's Committee for African Unity, Dr Ali Abdessalam Triki, stressed that Tunis and Tripoli were committed to promote and reinforce their commercial cooperation in accordance with decisions reached by their leaders. The report added that the two officials were satisfied with progress so far recorded in the implementation of the major projects identified, especially in the energy sector. Also, Libya and Tunisia decided to convene sector commissions before the holding of the next major follow up joint commission, the document stressed. Libya is Tunisia biggest trading partner in the Maghreb, the Arab world and Africa. Trade between the two countries amounted to 500 million dollars in 1999 is expected to rise to 700 million dollars this year. In their last meeting, President Ben Ali and Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi, decided to raise commercial exchanges between them to one billion dollars.

Libyan leader Moammar Kadhafi left Tunis by road on August 5, 2000, returning to Tripoli at the end of a three-day "working and friendship visit". During the visit, Kadhafi and his host, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali discussed issues related to bilateral cooperation and implementation of agreements signed between the two countries. Trade pacts between Libya and Tunisia are intended to boost the volume of commercial exchanges from a target of 700 million dollars this year to a billion dollars in the near future. The president of the Tunisian employers, Hedi Djilani expressed doubt, at a meeting with Tunisian businessmen, that this target might not be reached, because of the "unbearable competition" of Asian products. Colonel Kadhafi, however, reassured him that Tunisian products will be given preferential treatment on the Libyan market. Establishment of a Libyan-Tunisian free trade zone and the realization of "major joint projects" were also discussed, Tunisian official sources said but gave no further details. Tunis and Tripoli had agreed in the past to jointly exploit an off-shore oil deposit, near the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) and to connect their power grids. At the regional level, the two leaders dwelt on the Maghrebi process, stressing "the need, for all members of the Union of Arab Maghreb (UMA), to persevere in their efforts to revitalize the institutions" of the sub-regional grouping. UMA was formed in 1989, grouping Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania, but it has been at a standstill since 1995 due to the Western Sahara conflict in which Rabat and Algiers have opposing views. Ownership of the former Spanish territory is claimed by both Morocco and the Algerian-backed POLISARIO Front. The Libyan leader also met with Tunisia's political and intellectual, calling for the "inevitable" creation of an African economic space. He urged Arab countries to become members. "Africa is our future, it's a paradise. If the Arab countries want to preserve their existence, they should integrate with Africa," Khadafi said. In Colonel Kadhafi's view, only larger groupings are viable in this era of globalization and the Internet.

On June 15, 2001, Tunisia's President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, has praised Col. Kadhafi's efforts for the creation of the African Union. A statement issued in Tunis at the end of his two-day official visit to Libya, quoted Ali as saying that the creation of the African Union was "a valuable achievement for the continent and for the aspirations of its peoples for progress and prosperity." The statement said that Kadhafi welcomed Tunisia's decision to join the Community of the Sahelian and Saharan States. Kadhafi also commended President Ben Ali appeal for the cancellation of the debt burden impeding Africa's development process, and for the creation of a Global Solidarity and Poverty Reduction Fund to help Africans. Tunis and Tripoli stressed the need to co-ordinate and enhance their co-operation opportunities. The two leaders called for measures to revive Afro-Arab co-operation so as to promote the common interests of the Arab and African peoples. President Ben Ali and Col. Kadhafi expressed satisfaction about the existing bilateral relations between Libya and Tunisia. Libya is Tunisia's leading economic partner in the Arab world and in Africa. They agreed to make efforts to raise trade transactions from 700 million dollars to 1 billion dollars. Meanwhile, Tunisia reiterated its commitment to support Libya in the Lockerbie case and called for the lifting of all sanctions against Libya. The two leaders noted the efforts being made " to reactivate and restructure the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA). They underscored the need to consolidate co-operation between the UMA and the other regional and international groupings so as to safeguard the interests of the region and meet the challenges of globalization.

On June 18, 2002, the Libyan leader Muammer Qadhafi and the Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali held a meeting. The two sides reviewed the various aspects of cooperation between the two countries and stressed the need to strengthen them and expand the fields of cooperation for the common interests of the sons of the one people in the Great Jamahiriyah and Tunisia. The two sides also discussed African and international issues of common interest.

On June 27, 2003, Tunisia and Libya have signed an agreement to build an oil pipelines between them, the Tunisian News Agency (TAP) quoted officials here as affirming. One pipeline will carry petroleum products from Libya's Zaouia refinery to the Tunisian port of Skhira, while a second is envisaged for the transportation of crude, officials indicated. Quoting officials from both countries, TAP said the two neighbors were aiming at "increasing the value of their energy trade to 1 billion dollars, up from around 500 million dollars at present." According to official figures Tunisia, which exports limited volumes of crude from ageing oilfields saw its energy trade deficit soar to 302.1 million dinars (239 million US dollars) in 2002, compared to 1.7 million dinars in 1993.

President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali received on July 22, 2004, the Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah Abd-al-Rahman Muhammad Shalqam, who said that he had conveyed to the Tunisian president a message from the leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi and his brotherly greetings. He added that in view of the special bilateral relations between Tunisia and Libya and the excellent ties between Qadhafi and the Tunisian president, there was a tradition of consultation and the exchange of visits and contacts, particularly at such a time when the Arab region, Africa and the Mediterranean were witnessing changes at the regional and international levels. He pointed out that the meeting was an opportunity to discuss bilateral relations. He said in this respect: Relations between the two countries are exemplary in all spheres, particularly that the higher committee has recently met and discussed the development of cultural, youths and tourism ties. We have achieved large steps in the sphere of bilateral relations and laid down a mechanism to follow, expand and deepen them in all fields. We have achieved the goals of this cooperation. He said at the end of his statement that Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had entrusted me with conveying his warm greetings to the leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi, and renewing his invitation to the leader of Libya to visit Tunisia.

Tunisia's president telephoned Moammar Gadhafi on December 9, 2004, in a push to salvage the Arab Maghreb Union after Libya relinquished leadership of the five-nation group, the official news agency reported. The call by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to Gadhafi came a day after Libya announced the end of its presidency of the group, insisting the North African body had failed to achieve its goal of cooperation. Ben Ali expressed his concern to the Libyan leader about the decision, then contacted Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to press for reform of the 16-year-old body, the TAP news agency reported. In a statement on December 8, 2004, the Libyan Foreign Ministry said "the march of the union has stalled and violations are many ... therefore, Libya has decided to leave this union to its people." The ministry did not make it clear whether Libya would withdraw from the union, which groups Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The chairmanship rotates among the five heads of state. The union was founded in 1988 with an aim of promoting cooperation among its member, but has been dogged by disputes.

On August 30, 2005, the Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali received a Libyan special envoy who delivered a "written message" from Colonel Moammar Qadhafi. Said M. Hefiana, the Libyan under-secretary for External Relations and International Co-operation Ministry, said his visit "buttresses the noble traditions of consultations between the two countries' leaders on bilateral and regional issues." He noted the "the historical links between Tunisia and Libya," adding that "Tunisia's political, economic, and social stability is also Libya's stability." "All that affects Tunisia also affects Libya and the converse is true as well. When a Libyan national visits Tunisia, as part of a mission like the one I am on right now, he cannot feel like a stranger but rather like home among family members," Hefiana said.

Relations during the Libyan Civil War from 15 February – 23 October 2011 started getting tense due to spillover of violence and large influx of Libyan refugees. Between 21 April 2011 and 29 July 2011, Libyan Forces and Rebels engaged in what is known as the Battle of Wazzin, which was fought on Libyan and Tunisian border that also caused tension with Tunisia as violence spilled over into Tunisia. However, despite this, Tunisia still accepted refugees and did not get involved in fighting.

On 24 June 2012, working on building a better relationship with Libya’s transitional government by extraditing deposed Gaddafi’s former prime minister, which marks the first senior official to be returned for trial under Libya’s transitional government. On 7 March 2016, relations have started getting tense again as Tunisia fears that violence will spillover from Libya as dozens of militants stormed a Tunisian town near the border.
