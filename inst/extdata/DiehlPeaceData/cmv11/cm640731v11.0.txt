TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID51 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID51 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID51 from cm002731 narrative, this MID is the Korean War. Turkey and other UN forces fought along with the South Koreans, and China fought along with the North Koreans. North and South Korea were engaged in a territorial dispute in the Korean War, and the UN's support to South Korea led them to fight North Korea directly, triggering this MID between them. Coded third party link to territorial MID because the territorial dispute in Korea led Turkey to be involved in this MID against North Korea.

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID51 coded civil war MID because the Korean war had a civil war element as well, as the North Koreans (communists) were fighting the south Koreans (nationalists) for control over all of Korea. Coded civil war MID since North Korea is inside this dyad.
