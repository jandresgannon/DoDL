MID1269 

TERRMID: MID1269 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID1269 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1269 from Gibler 2018, in 1919, Germany invaded Latvia to establish a protectorate there, with intentions of moving on into Estonia. Germany attempted to invade Estonia in June 1919 (during this MID) but was pushed back by the Estonian army, bringing Estonia into this MID. The Allies eventually intervened and brokered an armistice between all parties. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to a territorial dispute between Germany and Estonia.
