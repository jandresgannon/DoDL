MID1363 

TERRMID: MID1363 3 -- not territory 
TERRMID-CER: MID1363 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1363 from cm narrative, this MID is about the internationalized Laotian Civil War. The US and Thailand were supporting the Royal Laotian Government (incumbent), and the USSR, China, and North Vietnam were supporting the communist guerrillas (militarized rebel group). The US and USSR did not want that conflict to lead to a direct conflict between US and USSR, and there was a push to resolve the conflict via a Geneva Conference. China warned that it would intervene with direct military force if SEATO intervened. This threat constitutes MID1363. Coded not territorial because Soviet Union and Laos were not disputing territory here. 

TERRLINK: MID1363 3 -- not third party link to territory 
TERRLINK-CER: MID1363 1 -- certain 
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1363 this is an internationalized civil war in which several countries supported the rebels or the regimes, but none of these countries were making a claim on Laotian territory.

CIVWARMID: MID1363 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1363 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1363 from cm002365 narrative, this MID was an internationalized Laotian Civil War. Thailand and USSR supported opposite sides in the war. A threat by China, who was supporting the communist guerrillas as the USSR was, triggered this multilateral MID. Coded civil war link because the Laotian Civil War is within this dyad and caused a MID between Laos and USSR here.

CIVWARMID: MID1353 1 -- civil war MID
CIVWARMID-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES:MID1353 from cm002365 narrative, this is related to the Laotian Civil War that takes place from 1963 to 1973. China directly supported the Pathet Lao communist insurgency and conducted military operations in northern Laos, and the USSR provided less direct support to communist insurgents. The US and Thailand supported the Royal Laotian Government (RLG) forces. Chinese forces directly engaged in combat with RLG forces, triggering this MID (due to the US and Thai support for RLG forces and USSR's support for communist forces). Coded civil war MID because the civil war in Laos is within this dyad and led to this MID.
