RIVNOTES: Following the logic and reasoning of Scott Bennett (see below) we combine create RIV10050 which combines RIV50 and RIV51.

Rivalry from riv30 eliminated in riv500 because disputes have been incorporated in other rivalries:
RIVALRY-RIV51

RIV52 is eliminated because the US does enter into conflict with Spain during World War~II.

Spain / United States Years: 1850-1898. Issues at stake: Spanish control over Cuba; Spain's general influence over Latin America and other territory in the Western Hemisphere. End coding: In the Treaty of Paris (December 10, 1898) Spain surrendered sovereignty over Cuba and ceded the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United for $20 million. This marks Spanish surrender of its entire colonial empire except for Africa. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 8. Last militarized dispute: 1898. Wars: 1898. Summary: The Spanish-American rivalry centered around Spain's declining colonial empire, particularly in the Western Hemisphere. The US distrusted any European country playing a major role in what it viewed as its sphere of influence. Declining Spanish power set the stage for several confrontations over Spanish influence until Spain was forced by the Spanish-American War to withdraw to Europe. In the early 1800s the US and Spain clashed over Florida, until Spain ceded it to the US in 1919. The three decades that followed were relatively free of conflict, but 1850 marks the first of a series of disputes over the next 20 years. The disputes in the 2nd half of the 19th century involved a number of separate areas, but all involved US opposition to continuing Spanish involvement in the Americas. The most important point of conflict was Cuba, where American business in particular wanted increased access and influence. Additionally, disputes arose over Spanish intervention in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Chile. Most of the disputes between Spain and the US were fairly mild, consisting of threats and military movements, and ship seizures, until the last part of the rivalry. The Spanish-American War grew out of the Cuban rebellion which had begun in 1895 and the sinking of the U.S.S. Maine in Havana harbor. Spanish forces on Cuba were and the Spanish fleet were soundly defeated in the 4 month long war, and in the Treaty of Paris (December 10, 1898) Spain was forced to surrender Cuba. It also ceded the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United for $20 million. With the transfer of these territories, Spain's colonial empire was reduced to 2 tiny colonies in Africa.
