TERRLINK-CER: MID1771 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1771 from Gibler (2018), this is connected to the Second Moroccan Crisis in which France invaded Morocco, to the chagrin of Germany. Germany issued military threats and deployed naval forces to attempt to compel France to leave Morocco, which Germany had a colonial stake in. It is unclear precisely how Norway is involved in this MID beyond the fact that Germany made a naval show of force off the coast of Norway. What is clear is that Norway had no direct stake in the Moroccan issue and made no threats to any other state, so Norway is not a direct party to the colonial territorial dispute. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Norway is pulled in to this territorial dispute between France and Germany when Germany made a show of force near NOrway's coast.
