NARRATIVE-CM:
Cambodia severed diplomatic relations with the United States on May 3, 1964. Cambodian troops shot down a US military transport aircraft near the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border on October 24, 1964, resulting in the deaths of eight US military personnel. Cambodia appealed for military assistance on October 26, 1964, and China agreed to provide military assistance on October 31, 1964. The US formally protested the downing of the military aircraft on November 2, 1964. US troops launched a military offensive against Vietcong rebels on Cambodian territory beginning on April 29, 1970. US troops completed their withdrawal from Cambodian territory on June 29, 1970. Some 338 US soldiers were killed during the military offensive. The US cargo ship *Mayaguez* was seized by Cambodian naval forces on May 12, 1975, and the ship's 38 crewmen were held in detention on the island of Koh Tang. *United Nations *(UN) Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim offered to facilitate negotiations between the countries on May 14, 1975. US military aircraft fired on a Cambodian fishing vessel on May 14, 1975. Some 227 US troops commanded by Lt. Colonel Randall Austin recaptured the *Mayaguez *on May 15, 1975. The 38 crewmen of the Mayaguez were released by the Cambodians on May 15, 1975. Some 41 US soldiers and 47 Cambodians were killed during the incident.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The rivalry between the United States and Cambodia revolves around the Vietnam War. In the war, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk sought a neutral position with respect to the warring parties across the border. He observed that the communist forces were winning the conflict in S. Vietnam and in Laos. He hoped that his country would remain free of interference by communist rebels and supports from Cambodia's neighbors. He did not however, have a military equipped to repel N. Vietnamese troops that used Cambodian territory for refuge and basing along the South Vietnamese border. The N. Vietnamese used a road system that paralleled the Vietnamese border in both Laos and Cambodian that came to be called the Ho Chi Mihn trail. Sihanouk either acquiesced to N. Vietnamese presence or ignored it. In either respect this inaction frustrated the US and S. Vietnam. This lead to hostility between the US and Cambodia. The US regularly violated the sovereignty of Cambodia during the Vietnam War in pursuit of N. Vietnamese troops and their S. Vietnamese rebel counterparts. The final MID in the rivalry is one that is a product of the still hard feelings over the US bombing campaigns in Cambodia. Thus the MIDs that constitute the rivalry between the US and Cambodia are united by the common element of the presence of communist troops in Cambodia. 

MID1213 occurred from March 13 until April 28, 1964. Here S. Vietnamese and US troops pursued Communist insurgents into Cambodia. They raided a village and in the dispute lost one plane and 17 were killed. 

MID1216 occurs from December of 1965 until August of 1965. This MID is a multilateral MID involving China and Cambodia on one side with Thailand, South Vietnam and the US on the other. Here the hostility centers on Cambodia. After cultivating close relations with the US in 1963, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk cancelled all military and economic aid from the US and broke of diplomatic relations with the US in 1965. He felt the Vietnamese Communists in South Vietnam were eventually going to win the struggle for power and entered into a compromise agreement with them. He allowed the communist rebels in South Vietnam, the NLF, and the North Vietnamese Army to set up bases along the Cambodian border with South Vietnam. He also permitted the receipt of shipments from China and the USSR at Cambodia's main port. Prince Sihanouk got in return the pledge that the Vietnamese would respect Cambodian independence. Additionally he received a pledge that the Vietnamese would not support the Khmer Rouge insurgency that was opposing the Prince. The US along with its allies Thailand and South Vietnam made several incursions into Cambodia in pursuit of Communist forces. In this MID Cambodia made threats to make reprisal attacks and implicitly called on China for assistance in threats to the US. 

MID1217 occurred in February of 1967. The Cambodian government charged February 5 that 100 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops had crossed the border into Cambodia February 2, 1967 and attacked the village of Svayngong. The statement claimed that two Cambodians were killed and six wounded. Here as in previous MIDs the US and S. Vietnamese pursued communist insurgents and guerillas into Cambodia. 

MID1806 occurs from January of 1968 until April of 1968. This is another multilateral MID with the USA and South Vietnam on one side and the PRC and Cambodia on the other. This MID is similar to MID1216. The US and South Vietnam pursue communist forces into Cambodia. Cambodian border guards clashed with the US and South Vietnam. China threatened to intervene on behalf of Cambodia. 

MID356 occurred from May 12 through May 15, 1975. Cambodia served as a major battlefield and transit area during the Vietnam War and had been subjected to a massive aerial bombardment by the United States. As a consequence, US - Cambodian relations were strained in 1975. The US cargo ship Mayaguez was seized by Cambodian naval forces on May 12, 1975, and the ship's 38 crewmen were held in detention on the island of Koh Tang. *United Nations *(UN) Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim offered to facilitate negotiations between the countries on May 14, 1975. US military aircraft fired on a Cambodian fishing vessel on May 14, 1975. Some 227 US troops commanded by Lt. Colonel Randall Austin recaptured the Mayaguez on May 15, 1975. The 38 crewmen of the Mayaguez were released by the Cambodians on May 15, 1975. The United States continued its air assault on Cambodian targets until 20 May 1975. Thereafter tensions remained high for some time. Some 41 US soldiers and 47 Cambodians were killed during the incident.

The last MID that occurs in the rivalry between the US and Cambodia occurs in 1975. This is also the last incident of activity of the US in S. Vietnam as the US aided Saigon as its final collapse in April and May of 1975. Other significant events that occur around this time are the victory of the Khmer Rouge in its protracted civil war within Cambodia. They came to power in December of 1975. The Khmer Rouge experiment was one of the most comprehensive disasters any country has experienced in the world since 1945. They exterminated the intellectuals, entrepreneurial, administrative, and landowning classes. They drove inhabitants of the cities into the country. The country was in a state of chaos as the Khmer Rouge government set out on a killing spree of all enemies of the state that were variously defined by Pol Pot. Eventually, the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and overthrew the Pol Pot regime. The Vietnamese puppet regime remained in power in Cambodia until 1989. 

In the fall of 1989, the Bush administration of the US initiated consultations with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council in an effort to establish a Cambodia settlement. This effort was designed to follow up on a decade long diplomatic effort by the UN and ASEAN to reach an agreement that all sides in the Cambodian internal conflicts would agree on. Vietnam was under increasing pressure by the collapse of its patron state, the USSR. It became increasingly isolated and pressured by the PRC to give up its ambitions to establish a hegemonic position in Indochina. Thus, Vietnam came to terms with the PRC. In the fall of 1991, a U.S. brokered UN Security Council framework agreement for a Cambodia peace process was accepted by all parties to include, the US, the PRC, Vietnam, other regional parties, and all factions of the internal Cambodian conflict. It was formally adopted in the fall of 1991. In early 1992, the first contingents of the UNTAC arrived in Phnom Penh to implement the peace plan. In a series of secret bilateral meetings between the leaders in Hanoi and Beijing that began in the fall of 1990, the Chinese induced the Vietnamese to accept the US sponsored UN peace plan for Cambodia. The UN verified the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and the UNTAC restored a sense of civil government in 1992. In the spring of 1993, the UN administered a successful popular election in Cambodia. 

As this process proceeded, the US and Vietnam resumed efforts to normalize relations after the war years and Hanoi's 1978 invasion of Cambodia. The US pressed Vietnam to back the Cambodia peace plan and to account for US MIAs in Vietnam and Laos. These objectives were established in the `roadmap' to normalization with Vietnam. This roadmap was substantially fulfilled with the culmination of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.
