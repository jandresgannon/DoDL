TERRLINK-NOTES: 

MARITMID: MID173 1 -- maritime MID
MARITMID-CER: MID173 2 -- somewhat uncertain 
MARITMID-NOTES: MID173 coded maritime because China and Taiwan dispute the entirety of each other's territory. Nonetheless, although the maritime border is disputed between Taiwan and China, the Matsu islands are not disputed for their maritime implications. Rather, the maritime borders are disputed because each claims the other's territory, including their maritime possessions. This dispute is localized to islands, and the islands themselves are not disputed due to maritime implications, so coded somewhat uncertain. 

ISLMID: MID173 1 -- islands MID
ISLMID-CER: MID173 1 -- certain 
ISLMID-NOTES: MID173 from Gibler 2018, in 1958 China attempted to invade the disputed Matsu island but was repelled by Taiwanese forces. The US came to Taiwan's defense.

ISLMID-NOTES: MID2859 Gibler 2018 mentions that this occurred near a disputed island, but this incident is connected to disputed waters, not the disputed island, as it involved fishing vessels. UNCLOS did not yet exist, so the island was not disputed with the intention of claiming the waters around it.

This dispute consists of 19 militarized incidents involving China, Taiwan, and the US. The overriding issue throughout this dispute is Chinese concern that Taiwan is moving toward independence from the mainland. As a result, China conducted a series of alerts, threats, and shows of force aimed at intimidating Taiwan. The Chinese shows of force included military exercises, missile tests, the deployment of missiles near Taiwan, and increased fighter sorties by Chinese jets near Taiwan. Taiwan responded to these actions by repeatedly placing its forces on alert and launching its own fighters when China conducted sorties near Taiwan. The tensions increased in late July 1999 when Chinese jets crossed the dividing line separating Taiwan and China on 2 separate occasions. The US responded to the increased tensions by deploying two aircraft carrier groups to the region in July and August 1999. The threats and shows of force by both sides continued into 2000. In February 2000 China passed a guided missile destroyer purchased from Russia through the Taiwan Strait in an effort to intimidate Taiwan. The United States responded by deploying the USS Kitty Hawk air craft carrier group to the region in late February. First day of dispute was on 2/00/1999 and last day of dispute was on 8/00/2000.

This dispute consists of 6 incidents in which Chinese threats toward Taiwan escalated to involve shows of force by both sides. The issue under dispute involves Chinese concern over Taiwanese moves toward independence. Because Chinese actions are aimed at changing Taiwanese behavior, China is coded as the revisionist state. The dispute began on 3/27/01 when China threatened to declare war if Taiwan declared independence. On 8/1/01 China again threatened to use force if Taiwan declared independence. These threats were followed by a Taiwanese show of force in which Taiwan conducted aerial flight maneuvers with 10 AH-1W Helicopters on 8/21/012. On 8/22/01 china conducted the largest exercises ever around Dongshan Island. According to reports, the exercises involved 100,000 personnel and simulated how the PLA would "smash" separatist actions by Taiwan. The US responded to the Chinese moves by threatening force if Taiwan was attacked. The US also conducted naval exercises in the South China Sea as a show of force. The naval exercise only lasted one day (8/17/01) and involved two U.S. aircraft carriers. China is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are aimed at altering Taiwanese policy toward independence. First day of dispute was on 3/27/2001 and last day of dispute was on 8/00/2001.

The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006. China has not given up the idea that Taiwan is part of China and since the election of Chien Shui-Bian as Taiwan's president in 2004 and the resurgence of independence feelings in Taiwan, the relations were as negative as during the whole existence of the rivalry. Since early in 2002 China placed over 400 short-range missiles across the straits from Taiwan. In March 2004 China carried several missile tests on the eve of a referendum in Taiwan which asks if Taiwan should buy more missiles if China is not willing to withdraw its 500+ missiles placed right across the straits in striking distance of Taiwan. In August 2005 Taiwan started deploying mobile missiles aimed at China's mainland. In March 2006 Taiwan announced tests for missiles capable of hitting China's mainland to take place in September 2006. In March 2006 China said it is aiming over 700 guided missiles at Taiwan. In October 2006 US expressed concern over Taiwan's deployment of missiles able to hit Shanghai and Hong-Kong. Even though there are some small steps in terms of trade and finances cooperation, the rivalry is not finished as the issue of contention (Taiwan's status) has not been resolved.

SB-CR:
People's Republic of China / Republic of China (Taiwan) Years: 1949-Present. Issues at stake: Legitimate government of China; existence of Taiwan as a sovereign state; control of offshore islands, especially Quemoy and Matsu. End coding: Continuing as of 1988, no settlement reached. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 6. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1988. Wars: None. Summary: The rivalry between the PRC and ROC in centered on each state's contention that they are the one legitimate government of China. At the end of WWII, war broke out between the Chinese Communists and Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong announced the existence of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. By December, 1949, all remaining Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-Shek had fled to Taiwan, where they had been building up a stronghold throughout the civil war. The rivalry begins with the formation of two separate states in 1949. Requests by the Republic of China for aid from the US were initially refused, and the Nationalist Chinese were forced to abandon the Hainan Straits, Congshan Island, and the Chusan islands, but retained control of Quemoy, Matsu, and the Pescadores. The US first stationed the 7th Fleet off Taiwan to defend it during the Korean War; this positioning continued until 1969. Fighting between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, both on the islands and in mainland China, continued through 1954, when the US signed a defense treaty with Taiwan. Fearing a full scale war, the US engaged in talks with the Communists from 1955 and 1957. However, clashes between the PRC and ROC continued, with no progress on solving the two-China problem. Militarized conflicts around Quemoy and Matsu in particular occurred through the late 1950s and 1960s. The US and the PRC both softened their rhetoric about the problem during their rapprochement in the early 1970s, with the US transferring official diplomatic recognition to the PRC in 1978. This coincided with a significant reduction in the number of disputes between the PRC and ROC starting about 1969. However, US aid to the ROC continued, and while the PRC has officially abandoned the goal of "liberating" Taiwan in favor of the possibility of "reunification,", neither China has been willing to reach a permanent settlement of their dispute. Minor militarized disputes between the two sides have continued to occur through the 1980s, although none have escalated to the level of fighting of the disputes of the 1950s. The rivalry is not finished as of December 2006. China has not given up the idea that Taiwan is part of China and since the election of Chien Shui-Bian as Taiwan's president in 2004 and the resurgence of independence feelings in Taiwan, the relations were as negative as during the whole existence of the rivalry. Even though there are some small steps in terms of trade and finances cooperation, the rivalry is not finished as the issue of contention (Taiwan's status) has not been resolved. Notes: In April, 1993, representatives of Taiwan and the PRC held their first face-to-face meetings. Territorial issues were not resolved, but agreements were reached regarding postal regulation, Taiwanese investment in mainland China, and on other minor issues.
