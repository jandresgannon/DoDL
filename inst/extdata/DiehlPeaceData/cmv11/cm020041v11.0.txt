TERRMID-NOTES: MID1002 from MID-B data, this MID occurred 4/28/1963-6/3/1963. From NYT 5/8/1963, Haiti and the Dominican Republic had a diplomatic crisis triggered when DR accused Haiti of violating its sovereignty and diplomatic immunity by invading the dominican embassy in Haiti. The countries temporarily severed ties and exchanged threats, leading the US and Canada to evacuate their citizens in Haiti, pulling them into this MID. US officials condemned the Haitian government in this dispute. Coded not territory because no countries in this MID were disputing territory, and this was connected to Dominican Republic and Haiti having a diplomatic dispute.

This dispute is comprised of a series of incidents generated by United States led efforts to restore the rule of Haitian President Aristide after he was deposed in a coup. The incidents begin with a naval blockade in October of 1993 where the United States was joined by a number of other nations (Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Haiti, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). As the blockade wore on, and the military junta led by General Cedras remained in place, the United States resorted to a number of threats of military action and displays of force. The dispute was resolved with the return of Aristide only after the intercession of US Special Envoy Jimmy Carter. An invasion force was in the air as the deal was brokered. First day of dispute was on 10/18/1993 and last day of dispute was on 9/29/1994.
