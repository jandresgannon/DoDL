NARRATIVE-CM:

SOURCES-CM:
Some 167,000 Burmese Muslims fled as refugees to Bangladesh from April 18 to June 3, 1978 as a result of religious persecution in Burma. The *International Committee of the Red Cross *(ICRC) provided humanitarian assistance to the refugees in Bangladesh. President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh accused Burma of "inhuman eviction of Muslism" on May 7, 1978, but Burma denied the accusation on May 10, 1978. Bangladesh appealed to *United Nations *(UN) Secretary-General Kurt Walheim for assistance on May 19, 1978 (some 150,000 Burmese Muslims had already fled as refugees to Bangladesh). The *United Nations High Commission for Refugees *(UNHCR), *World Food Program *(WFP), *World Health Organization (WHO), and *United Nations Children's Fund *(UNICEF) provided humanitarian assistance to the refugees in Bangladesh beginning on May 30, 1978. Bangladesh troops and Burmese troops clashed near the border on December 21, 1991, resulting in the deaths of one Bangladesh soldier and three Bangladesh civilians. China offered to mediate in the dispute between Bangladesh and Burma in November 1992. Bangladesh troops and Burmese troops clashed near the border on December 28, 1999.
