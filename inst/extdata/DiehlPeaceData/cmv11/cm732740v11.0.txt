This dispute consists of three disputes between Japan and South Korea over athree day period from 2/15/96 to 2/17/96. The dispute is over control of the Takeshima Islands, a series of islets approximately 150 km from both Japan and South Korea. The waters surrounding the islands are believed to be rich in both marine life and natural resources. As a result, because both states are attempted to claim the uninhabited islands, both states are coded as revisionist states. On 2/15/96 South Korea conducted exercises involving naval warships, fighter jets, a maritime police vessel, and a helicopter near the Takeshima Islands. Keesings described the exercises as "an unambiguous show of force." In response, Japan sent a patrol vessel to the area which was subsequently drive out by South Korean vessels as it attempted to approach the Takeshimas on two occasions between 2/15/96 and 2/17/96.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Japan and South Korea disputed the sovereignty of the Tokto (Takeshima) islands in the Sea of Japan. South Korea claimed that the islands were in its territorial waters on January 18, 1952, but Japan rejected the claim on January 28, 1952. Japan protested the presence of South Korean fishermen on the islands on June 22, 1953. Japanese and South Korean naval ships clashed near the islands on July 12, 1953 and August 23, 1954. Japan proposed that the dispute be submitted to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on September 25, 1954, but South Korea rejected the proposal on October 28, 1954. Japan and South Korea agreed to resume diplomatic relations on June 22, 1965. South Korean naval ships and military aircraft held exercises near the disputed islands on February 15, 1996.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The South Koreans may remain embittered over the long occupation/subjugation by the Japanese. This certainly seems the case at the outset of the rivalry. Also, early in the life of the rivalry between the two countries, Dr. Syngman Rhee seemed to add fuel to the fire of hostility. He established the Rhee line to demarcate Korean fishing waters. The line extended up to 60 miles from the Korean shore at some points. This line extended over traditional Japanese fishing waters. The tangible issue that motivates the rivalry especially at the outset is territory. There are disputes over fishing waters and an islet chain known in the west as the Liancourt Rocks which sit midway between the Korean peninsula and Japan. The disputes over the islet chain are the issue to which the two states, especially the South Koreans return. 

On October 15, 1952, the relations between the two countries were strained again because of South Korea's decisions to imprison Japanese fishermen fishing in disputed maritime waters. 

MID1344 took place in February of 1953. Here a South Korean patrol boat shot a fisherman in disputed fishing waters. 

MID1345 occurred on 31 July 1954. Here South Korean military members took control of a small island group in the Japan Sea known by the Japanese as the Takeshima islands. 

MID1346 occurred from August through December of 1955. The Koreans placed a ban on trade and travel with Japan. Dr. Rhee, the president of South Korea established the Rhee line which extended as far as sixty miles from the Korean coast. This line demarcated fishing waters for the S. Koreans. During this period relations were described as near the breaking point. S. Korea wanted Japan to waive claims that it maintained on property within S. Korea that dated to the time of Japanese occupation of the peninsula. Dr. Rhee also complained that Japan was not taking a forceful enough anti communist stand. Another issue was the S. Korean refusal to accept hundreds of Koreans for deportation who had committed crimes in Japan. 

MID1347 occurred in January of 1958. About 100 Korean fishermen detained in Japanese waters began a hunger strike after a prolonged detention. There are several hundred fishermen total in the camp. Another issue disputed during this time was Korean art taken by the Japanese to Japan. The Koreans wanted it back and raised this issue during this period. Another issue here was the permission given by the Japanese to allow Koreans living in Japan to be repatriated to North Korea. This issue angered the South Koreans. 

MID2838 occurred on 2/14/1959. Here the Koreans were incensed by the Japanese move to repatriate thousands of Koreans living in Japan to N. Korea. The South Korean Navy was reported to have made preparation to deal with the Japanese move. 

MID2839 occurred on 11.16.1959. Here a South Korean patrol ship fired on a Japanese fishing boat in the Korea Strait wounding a crewman. 

MID1349 occurred on January 13, 1961. 

MID3310 occurred on 10/29/61. A South Korean patrol boat fired on and captured a Japanese fishing boat. The incident occurred in Japanese territorial waters. The boat was the twelfth seized in 1961.

On September 17, 1949, the South Korean Prime Minister, Syngmann Rhee, has sent a message to Douglas MacArthur, in which he stated the willingness of South Korea to conclude a peace treaty with Japan. He said that South Korea's policy toward Japan is to forget the differences and `let bygones, by bygones'. He also said that he hoped South Korea could start trade relations with Japan at soon as possible. On September 8, 1951, Japan signed the Treaty of San Francisco in which it renounced any claims to the Korean Peninsula. 

On October 15, 1952, the relations between the two countries were strained again because of South Korea's decisions to imprison Japanese fishermen fishing in disputed maritime waters.

Japanese and South Korean representatives signed an agreement in Seoul on February 5, 1974, which provided for the joint development of the continental shelf between the two countries. 

MID2963 occurred on 12-13 November 1977. I was not able to find specific information on this MID. 

Japan-South Korea economic relations are entering a new "honeymoon era" as an increasing number of Japanese business leaders visit South Korea to hold talks with their Korean counterparts in an effort to ward closer economic cooperation. On July 21, 1981, Yoshihiro Inayama, head of Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), and other Japanese business leaders promised President Chun Doo-hwan of South Korea that Japan would cooperate with South Korea to the fullest extent to help the economic and social development of that country. The Japanese business leaders made the pledge during their courtesy call on President Chun when they visited South Korea to attend the meeting of the 13th Joint Conference of Japan-Korea and Korea-Japan Economic Committees held in Seoul.

Talks between the South Korean and Japanese Foreign Ministers were held in Tokyo on 20th and 21st August, 1981. Referring to the talks, the South Korean said they were aimed at cementing the special relations between South Korea and Japan, and the Japanese authorities said that the talks would mark a start of a new era in Japan-South Korea relations. According to reports, the talks dealt with an assessment of the situation on the Korean peninsula, the issue of Japan's economic aid for South Korea and other related matters. 

MID2974 occurred from April 24, 1982 to July 13, 1982. I was not able to find specific information on this MID.

On March 10, 1989, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that South Korea’s president, Roh Tae Woo, announced that he will visit Japan in May 1989. The visit aims to improve the relations between the two countries. Roh is going to be the first South Korean president to visit Osaka, where a significant South Korean minority lives. 

Japan-South Korea relations came one step closer to maturity, after the two nations' leaders met casually in a Kyoto restaurant on November 10, 1992. The meeting was crucial for both countries, as South Korea needed to demonstrate its readiness for membership in the international community and Japan is striving to quiet anti-Japan sentiment in South Korea. When President Roh Tae Woo hastily returned home following the meeting with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, confirming the important partnership, observers of Japan-South Korea relations viewed the president's Japan visit as a mere farewell gesture prior to his leaving office. However, South Korea is seeking to win membership in the international community by constructing a mature relationship with Japan under the "Japan-South Korea partnership" motto. Both countries deemed it necessary to emphasize the importance of the partnership. The meeting was important for Japan, as indicated by a Foreign Ministry source's comment that "South Korea is one of the closest countries with which Japan may secure a partnership. It is important to meet and discuss peace and stability in East Asia." South Korea's ambassador to Japan, O Chae Hui, added, "Due to the results of our Northern diplomacy, South Korea today has made great diplomatic gains unimaginable a few years ago. Japan, on the other hand, has a major role to play in creating a new international order. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for South Korea and Japan to have a forum for an exchange of opinion that is uninhibited and free of protocol." Japan hopes that such relations may quell anti-Japan sentiment in South Korea and lead to mature Japan-South Korea relations. However, Japan and South Korea took care to consider anti-Japan feelings in South Korea and anti-South Korea emotions in Japan. The countries purposely evaded heated issues such as South Korean women conscripted as prostitutes in former Japanese Army brothels. Roh said, "This meeting has become a milestone in South Korea-Japan relations."

On February 20, 1993, South Korea's incoming president, Kim Young Sam, said that relations with Japan and the United States are vital for his country. Kim Young Sam, who will become the 14th president of South Korea on February 25, 1993, said his country's relations with Japan and the United States are vital for the development and prosperity of South Korea. In an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun on February 20, 1993, Kim said he wanted to hold talks with Japan Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as soon as possible. "My position is that we must promote cooperation with Japan in various fields, with the Japan-U.S. security treaty serving as the core (of that relationship)," he said. "In areas such as politics, security, economy and culture, ties among South Korea, Japan and the United States are vital to the development and prosperity of South Korea." A visit by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko would do a lot for Seoul-Tokyo relations, he added. Kim said a precondition would be the solving of the trade deficit and other historic problems such as the comfort women's issue. 

MID4126 occurred in February of 1996. Here the South Korean Navy practiced repelling a naval attack on the Liancourt Rocks (Takeshima to the Japanese and Tokto to the Koreans). This naval maneuver was intended to deter the Japanese from enforcing their intention to establish their 200 mile exclusive economic zone in accordance with the law of the sea. The rocks have been at the center of the dispute since the beginning of the rivalry between Japan and South Korea. 

South Korea's foreign affairs and trade minister will visit Tokyo in mid-May 1998, carrying a message that Seoul wants better ties with Japan, government officials said on May 12, 1998. President Kim Dae-jung, a longtime opposition leader who once exiled himself in Japan in the 1970s, has said he would more actively try to improve ties with Japan than his predecessors. Japan ruled Korea as a colony in 1910-45. Their bumpy relations have recently strained further because of fisheries and other disputes. During his May 21-23 visit, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Park Chung-soo will discuss ''establishing a new cooperative relationship'' with Japan, pursued by his boss, a news release said. In Tokyo, Park will meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and other Japanese officials and industrialists, it said. Park will also try to lay the foundation for President Kim's planned visit to Japan later this year, during which South Korea hopes to settle some of its diplomatic feuds with Japan, Seoul officials said. South Korea needs financial assistance from Japan to rebuild its battered economy, now a recipient of a record dollars 58 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund. In an emotion-charged row, Japan unilaterally abrogated a 1965 fisheries treaty with South Korea in January, citing lack of progress in more than a year of negotiations. That touched off angry anti-Japan protests in South Korea. After President Kim took office in February, South Korea resumed fisheries talks with Japan. Kim's government also promises to promote cultural and other exchanges with Japan. Because of lingering anti-Japanese sentiment among its people, South Korea has made its markets off-limits to Japanese movies and other cultural products. The new South Korean government also removed another roadblock to improving ties with Japan when it recently compensated 150 Korean women forced to serve as prostitutes in Japanese front-line military brothels during World War II. While giving out the compensations, the government said it would not try to recover the money from the Japanese government. For years, the former sex slaves had fought for direct Japanese government compensations a demand Tokyo has repeatedly rejected.

MID4127 occurred from February 15-19, 1999. This dispute consisted of one incident in which Japanese forces seized a South Korean fishing boat that was fishing in waters claimed as an exclusive economic zone for China and Japan. South Korea protested the seizure and Japan released the vessel 4 days later.

Most of the MIDs that have occurred between Japan and South Korea have lasted one or two days. The trend seems to be that the engage in saber rattling over an issue but there is rarely any active military involvement. Accordingly, it has been difficult to find direct reference to all of the MIDs within the rivalry. Information is available about the nature of the hostilities and animosities, but in many cases actual details of militarized activities between the states does not rise to the level that would bring the event to the attention of journalists in the west. 

Japan has asked South Korea in mid-September 2002 to talk about the designation of what it knows as the "Sea of Japan", Japanese Foreign Ministry sources said on 29 August 2002. Japan's request for talks with South Korea is aimed at asserting its position against South Korea's demand that it also be known as the "East Sea", the sources said, adding that experts from the Japan Coast Guard will also take part. South Korea is demanding that the "Sea of Japan"-referring to the body of water bordered by the Korean Peninsula to the west, the Russian Far East to the north and the Japanese archipelago to the east-be renamed or internationally recognized as both the Sea of Japan and the East Sea. South Korea calls it the "East Sea". According to the sources, the ministry is countering South Korea's argument by distributing 10,000 pamphlets to its diplomatic missions. In the pamphlets, Japan is arguing that that name "Sea of Japan" has been known internationally since the late 18th century and more than 97 per cent of world maps use it. The sources said the issue was also taken up by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in its diplomatic relation group meeting Thursday, and many of them had urged the Foreign Ministry to deal with the issue firmly. The ministry has also sent pamphlets to the venue of the UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names in Berlin which opened Tuesday. A minister of the Japanese embassy in South Korea has also been dispatched to the conference. Seoul has raised the "Sea of Japan" issue at the conference, which meets once every five years, since 1992. It says the term "Sea of Japan" attained popular use when Korea was under Japanese rule. Japan annexed Korea in 1910 and ruled it as a colony until the end of World War II in 1945. Seoul says the world should recognize South Korea's national sensibilities and drop the name "Sea of Japan" from atlases, or failing that, recognize both the Sea of Japan and the East Sea. Separately, Japan learned that the "Sea of Japan" designation had been eliminated-apparently in consideration of South Korea's claim-in a draft guideline of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), which is responsible for harmonizing nautical charts and documents. The "Limits of Oceans and Seas" guideline is currently being revised and IHO member states have until the end of November to respond to revision proposals.

South Korea will continue its undersea resource exploration around a group of disputed islets in the East Sea to show that they belong to Seoul, a government minister said on March 10, 2005. South Korea considers Dokdo as part of its territory, but Japan claims that the rocky outcropping belongs to Tokyo, calling it "Takeshima." "Despite the territorial dispute, the government will keep carrying out resource exploration projects around Dokdo," Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Oh Geo-don said. The minister expressed regret over Japan's repeated claim to the islets in the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan. "It is regrettable that Tokyo continues to insist Dokdo belongs to Japan," he said. "The islets belong to South Korea, and this is irrefutable." Since the islets are historically and legally part of South Korea, it is necessary to react cautiously to "any provocation" by Japan since it could give the impression that ownership of the territory is in dispute, Oh said. In late February, Toshiyuki Takano, Tokyo's ambassador to Seoul, again claimed Dokdo is part of Japan's territory, enraging South Koreans and sparking a wave of protest rallies across South Korea. The islets have been a bone of contention between South Korea and Japan for decades owing to the latter's claim that it has sovereignty over them. The islets lie halfway between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. South Korea has posted a Coast Guard contingent on the islets since 1954 as a sign of its sovereignty. Japan frequently claims that the islets belong to them and has asked for international legal arbitration, but South Korea has brushed them off.

On June 13, 2006, Japan and South Korea failed to narrow their gap over a dispute in demarcating their exclusive economic zones around a pair of South Korea-controlled islets in the Sea of Japan after their two days of talks in Tokyo, but agreed to meet again in September to continue negotiations, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said. "There was a large gap in the positions of Japan and South Korea, but we have agreed to work toward making an agreement acceptable to both sides over defining our EEZ boundaries based on international law," Ichiro Komatsu, Japan's chief delegate to the EEZ talks, told reporters. During the talks, Japan requested that South Korea halt its planned survey on sea current near the disputed islets next month if it intends to go forward without giving Japan advance notice, a ministry official said. South Korea rejected the request, according to the official, raising prospects that bilateral tensions similar to those in April may reignite. Meanwhile, Japan and South Korea agreed in principle to hold their next round of talks in September in Seoul, Komatsu, head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's International Legal Affairs Bureau, said following their 10-hour "serious, in-depth discussions." The two nations held talks at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo to resolve a dispute over demarcating their EEZs around the disputed islets in the Sea of Japan, which South Korea calls the East Sea. The zones claimed by the two nations overlap around the islets, which are known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea. Park Hee Kwon, director general for the Treaties Bureau of the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and head of South Korea's delegation to the talks, told a separate group of reporters, "It was a difficult, but meaningful meeting." The latest EEZ talks resumed after a six-year suspension. Tokyo and Seoul held such talks in 2000 and they ended without an agreement. According to Komatsu, South Korea told Japan it "had no choice" but to push for a more extensive EEZ than it claimed in previous talks by making Takeshima the cardinal point because of recent tensions that flared after Japan decided to conduct a marine survey near the islets in April, drawing strong protests from South Korea. Referring to the Japan Coast Guard's move to conduct the survey, Komatsu quoted the South Korean delegation as telling him Japan is at "fault" as to why South Korea decided to expand its EEZ further to the east which will thus make it closer to the Japanese side. South Korea in past negotiations proposed drawing a median line between its Ullung Island and Oki islands off Shimane Prefecture in western Japan, with Ullung as the cardinal point. In response to South Korea's assertion, Komatsu said Japan stuck to its previous position to draw a median line between Takeshima and Ullung Island, located west of the disputed islets. In April, the countries had averted a maritime confrontation through a vice-ministerial meeting in Seoul after they reached a compromise in which Japan agreed to withdraw its plan to conduct the survey. To avoid further possibilities of confrontation, Japan proposed creating a system in which the two nations would give each other advance notice when conducting surveys in waters where the EEZ claims overlap, similar to what Japan has with China, the official said. Japan also stressed to South Korea the importance for both nations to exercise "restraint" over such surveys, the official said, indicating that Japan called on South Korea to halt its planned survey next month. South Korea, however, refused to talk about it, saying discussions on the system are not subject to the EEZ talks and that they do not have the "mandate" to engage in negotiations on the system, the official said. Japan and South Korea, during their talks, confirmed their 1996 bilateral agreement in which their nations' top leaders-then Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young Sam-agreed to hold EEZ negotiations without linking their nations' claims of sovereignty over the islets, the official said. Both nations from the very start engaged in the latest EEZ talks on the premise that the outcome of the EEZ talks would not affect their territorial claims, according to the official. The islets themselves have long been a source of dispute between the two nations which both claim sovereignty over them. Japan intends to hold separate discussions on the system of advance notice from the EEZ talks, the official said. In a news conference before Tuesday's talks began, Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, Japan's top government spokesman, said, "It is important to engage in constructive negotiations to resolve (the EEZ issue) through dialogue for a stable management of Japan-South Korea relations." Japan and South Korea held four rounds of EEZ negotiations between 1996-the year both countries ratified the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea-and 2000, alternately in Tokyo and Seoul. Located 157 kilometers northwest of Oki islands, Takeshima consists of two small islets and reefs with a total area of 0.23 square km. It is a rich fishing ground. Japan says it incorporated Takeshima as part of Shimane in 1905, but in January 1952, Syngman Rhee, South Korea's first president, created the so-called "Syngman Rhee Line" between Japan and South Korea and unilaterally declared territorial rights in connection with the islets. South Korea has effectively ruled the islets since 1954 when South Korea stationed coast guard personnel on the islets.

Japan will conduct a radioactive waste survey in waters near South Korean-controlled islets in the Sea of Japan and sought cooperation from South Korea, Yonhap News Agency reported on August 2, 2006. The presidential office held a meeting of concerned government departments, expecting the survey near the islets, which are also claimed by Japan, could be held in late August and early September, Yonhap reported. The survey will be conducted to examine the effects of radioactive waste dumped in waters near Vladivostok in Russia's far eastern region by the Soviet Union, Yonhap said. Japan has notified South Korea that one or two of sites to be covered in the survey are in South Korea's exclusive economic zone, Yonhap said. When South Korea, Japan, Russia and the International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a joint survey in 1994, the survey concluded there was no effect from the waste. Since then, South Korea and Japan have conducted surveys every year, according to Yonhap. The islets in the Sea of Japan, which South Korea calls the East Sea, are known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan. Last month, South Korea conducted its maritime survey in the Japan-claimed EEZ around the islets, despite Japan's strong protest over the survey. Japan and South Korea became embroiled in a bitter dispute in April when the Japan Coast Guard said it planned to conduct a marine survey in waters near the islets, drawing a strong protest from South Korea. The two countries subsequently averted a confrontation in a vice ministerial meeting in Seoul after they reached a compromise in which Japan agreed to withdraw its plan to conduct the survey. Japan insists that Takeshima, which consists of two small uninhabited islets and numerous reefs with a total area of 230,000 square meters, is part of Shimane Prefecture, while South Korea claims that Dokdo is part of North Gyeongsang Province.

Discussion:
MID1346 occurred from August through December of 1955. The Koreans placed a ban on trade and travel with Japan. Dr. Rhee, the president of South Korea established the Rhee line which extended as far as sixty miles from the Korean coast. This line demarcated fishing waters for the S. Koreans. During this period relations were described as near the breaking point. S. Korea wanted Japan to waive claims that it maintained on property within S. Korea that dated to the time of Japanese occupation of the peninsula. Dr. Rhee also complained that Japan was not taking a forceful enough anti communist stand. Another issue was the S. Korean refusal to accept hundreds of Koreans for deportation who had committed crimes in Japan.

Another issue disputed during this time was Korean art taken by the Japanese to Japan. The Koreans wanted it back and raised this issue during this period. Another issue here was the permission given by the Japanese to allow Koreans living in Japan to be repatriated to North Korea. This issue angered the South Koreans.
