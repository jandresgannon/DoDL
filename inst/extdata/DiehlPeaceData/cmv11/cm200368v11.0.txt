TERRLINK-NOTES: MID133 from Gibler (2018), this is a territorial MID involving the area of Memel, valued mostly for its port. The Allied Powers in 1923 were considering whether to grant the port to Lithuania or Poland, who were disputing the territory. On 1/11/1923, Lithuania invaded the territory, triggering a MID between Lithuania and the Allied Powers of UK, France, and Italy. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was connected to the territorial dispute over Memel.
