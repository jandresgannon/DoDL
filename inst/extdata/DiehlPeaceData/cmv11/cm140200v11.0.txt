NARRATIVE-CM:
Brazil and Britain disputed the border between Brazil and British Guiana beginning in the 1830s. The countries signed an agreement in London on November 6, 1901, which provided for a peaceful settlement of the dispute and Italian arbitration. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy accepted the role of arbitrator in the dispute concerning the border between Brazil and British Guiana. Italy awarded 5,400 square miles of the disputed territory to Brazil and 7,600 square miles of the territory to Britain on June 6, 1904. Brazil and Britain signed a border agreement on April 22, 1926.

NARRATIVE-CR:
The Brazil and Great Britain rivalry during the 19th century was over two issues, one involving a territorial dispute over Pirara between Brazil and British Guyana and the second involving the slave trade. These disputes are clearly separate although they are joined together rather closely in time. The very first mid between the two countries, MID1622 in 1826 involved the seizure of British property during Brazil's blockade of the Rio de la Plata and is not a part of either rivalry.

The territorial dispute was one of many that Brazil had with its neighbors, brought about by ambiguous boundary delineations during the colonial period. Brazil claimed part of the Essequibo region after its independence on the basis of a Portuguese survey of boundaries in the area from 1787 to 1804. These claims were not recognized by Great Britain who formally held the territory. In 1810, Great Britain marked its territory to include Pirara, which was part of the territory claimed by Brazil. In 1838, Brazil sent in a detachment to claim Pirara (MID2013 on 8/15/1838) but subsequently removed it. On July 15, 1839, Great Britain sent an expedition to the area that reclaimed the territory (MID1740 on 7/15/1839). On February 15, 1842 Brazil reclaimed the territory (MID1624 on 2/15). In 1843 Brazil and Great Britain agreed to keep the Pirara region neutral until the dispute could be settled. King Victor Emmanuel of Italy aribtrated the dispute and in 1904 decided in favor of British claims to Pirara. The arbitration was agreed upon by both countries, terminating the dispute. The dispute overall was not really an intense one, with no actual fighting among troops seemingly having occured. The region at the time was particularly isolated and not of major importance to either side. In addition, Great Britain was more concerned about its dispute with Venezuela over a much larger and important portion of British Guyana, leaving it little time to bother with the small Brazilian claim.

The second group of mids involved the Brazilian slave trade. In helping Brazil attain its independence from Portugal in 1822, Great Britain requested that Brazil terminate the slave trade upon independence. In 1826, the two countries signed a treaty to this effect, making slave trading illegal after three years. Brazil failed to enforce illegal slave trading, leading in March 1845 to Great Britain passing the Aberdeen Act, which allowed it to seize all condemn all Brazilian ships involved in the slave trade. The Act was based on a treaty between the two countries signed in 1826 that recognized slavery as an act of piracy. From 1845 to 1850, Great Britain seized over 400 Brazilian ships suspected of slaving (MID1624 on 6/4/1845 and MID1627 on 8/1/1849). On July 12, 1850 Brazil began enforcing the piracy laws to stop the slave trade. The enforcement was disrupted with the outbreak of the war with Paraguay from 1865 to 1870 but on May 13, 1888, Brazil officially ended slavery as an institution after two decades of domestic dispute over the issue, ending the rivalry with Great Britain.

Termination of both the slave trade and slavery was possible due to a combination of factors beyond British pressure to do so. First, in September 1848 a Conservative anti-slavery parliament came into power, putting additional pressure on the empire. Economic benefits in addition to moral imperatives were argued as rationale for ending the trade. With slavery as an institution, the government was forced to appropriate large sums of money away from agricultural development in order to pay for slaves. Ending slavery allowed this capital to be reinvested in establishing stronger credit lending institutions and financing industrial projects. In 1865, Emperor Dom Pedro, began preparing a way to progressively emancipate the current slave population. In 1868, the Conservative parliament was replaced by a Liberal one, that called for an end to slavery in addition to widespread suffrage and other liberal reforms. In September of 1871, Parliament passed the "Law of Free Birth" stating that all children of slaves born from then on were free. Despite these successes, Parliament was still dominated by slavery interests. Indeed , the "Law of Free Birth" was an effort to quell some of the abolitionist fervor that had swept across most of the empire. All the law did, however, was to provide increased momentum to the abolitionist effort that led to the ending of slavery in 1888.

MID1762 on 6/15/1862 involved the seizure of British cargo and the imprisonment of British sailors by Brazil. Great Britain demanded reparations and blockaded Rio de Janeiro for six days. Brazil refused to pay reparations and terminated diplomatic relations with Great Britain until 1865.

The last two mids between Brazil and Great Britain are isolated disputes and do not include any of the issues of either rivalry.

In January 1895, Great Britain occupied Trinidad island that was claimed by Brazil (MID1645 on 1/15/1895). Brazil demanded an immediate withdrawal from the island. Great Britain suggested the two countries' should seek arbitration but Brazil rejected the offer. Portugal's minister of foreign relations, Counselor Luis Soveral offered good offices to resolve the dispute. Portugal further argued that Brazil held legitimate claim to the island. Great Britain departed the island on July 15, 1895.

The last mid between the two countries (MID3864 on 12/3/1940). It involved the arrest and seizure by Great Britain of a Brazilian ship near Gibraltar. The ship was released two weeks later.
