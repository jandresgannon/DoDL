TERRMID-NOTES: MID27 from cm narrative, this is the Berlin Wall Crisis in 1961. West Germany did not recognize East Germany and claimed all of Germany's territory as rightfully theirs. The construction of the wall led to exchanges of threats and shows of force between West and East Germany. Coded territorial MID because this was centered on Berlin, a contested city, and West Germany claimed all of East Germany's territory.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID2219 from cm narrative, this is a multilateral MID with the US and West Germany v. the USSR and East Germany that occurred from December of 1961 until October of 1962. This mid covers a period of several minor incidents that all served to increase hostilities. In December, the East Germans and the Soviets protested to the United States regarding hostile troop movements along the autobahn link connecting Berlin with West Germany. This was followed by the East German shooting of an American military vehicle that was part of the US mission in Potsdam. East Germany and West Germany had a territorial dispute, as West Germany claimed that East Germany's territory rightly belonged to the West as a united Germany. Coded territorial MID because this was connected to the East-West Germany territorial dispute.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The *Federal Republic of Germany *(FRG) was established on May 23, 1949, and the *German Democratic Republic* (GDR) was established on October 7, 1949. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany refused to recognize the GDR on October 22, 1949. East Germany closed the border between East Berlin and West Berlin beginning on August 13, 1961, and built a wall between East Berlin and West Berlin beginning on August 15, 1961. The United States deployed 1,500 combat troops to West Berlin from West Germany on August 19, 1961. East German and West German representatives signed a treaty on December 20, 1972, which provided for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the countries. East Germany and West Germany established diplomatic relations on June 21, 1973. The East German parliament approved the reunification of East Germany with West Germany on August 23, 1990, and the reunification went into effect on October 3, 1990.

NARRATIVE-CR:

The first MID of RIV729, MID27, occurred in August of 1961. The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 helped to stem the flow of people out of the East and helped East Germany officials consolidate the state. During the 1960s, West Germany refused to recognize the East Germany state; this was the case despite growing pressure to do so by other Western powers trying to nurture detente between the East and West blocs in Europe. This all changed, however, when a Willy Brandt led coalition government was elected in West Germany in 1969. The existence of East Germany was recognized for the first time by a West Germany chancellor. In the subsequent years, the two countries began negotiations to improve relations. 
MID2219 occurred from November 19, 1961 to August 14, 1962. This MID is about the Berlin Wall and ensuing negotiations over how to deal with it. 

MID2932 occurred on October 12, 1967. The only information that could be indirectly attributed to this MID is that the East German leadership showed its displeasure with a detente in the Soviet Union-West German relationship. But this is not enough to constitute a MID. Thus, no specific information could be found on this event. 

The last MID of Riv729, MID2944, occurred in January 1971. The first step toward normalization came when the United States, France, the USSR, and the United Kingdom signed the Four Powers Agreement on September 3, 1971. This treaty was aimed at normalizing interactions between East and West Germany. In earl 1972 a treaty was signed regulating commercial traffic between the two German states.

In July 1945, an agreement was reached at Potsdam stating that the four allies would jointly administer Germany. Growing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union made this policy increasingly difficult to implement. The permanent division of Germany between East and West was precipitated by the formation of two competing alliance blocks led by the United States and the Soviet Union. Neither country wanted to see a unified Germany fall into the sphere of influence of the other. Consequently, a divided Germany was the preferred outcome for both powers. Despite this, West Germany's government geared most policy toward reunification. In particular, West German officials initially avoided writing a constitution and West German citizenship was extended to all people in East Germany. At the same time, West German economic and military policy strove toward alignment with the Western powers. The culmination of these efforts came on May 5, 1955 when West Germany achieved sovereignty and on May 9 became a NATO member state. The policy of alignment with the Western powers, however, made reunification increasingly unlikely. The Soviet Union made repeated overtures in 1952, 1955, and 1958 to support German reunification if West Germany would sever ties with the Western Powers. This was unacceptable to West Germany, especially since the Soviet Union refused to accept demands of democratic governance in East Germany. 

West Germany policy towards East Germany in the mid-to late 1950s involved creating economic instability in hopes that instability would lead to reunification. West Germany refused to have contact with East German officials. Even more, West Germany, in an attempt to isolate East Germany, initiated the Hallstein Doctrine. This doctrine specified that West Germany would break diplomatic relations with any country that established relations with East Germany. Although this prevented West Germany from engaging with any of the Eastern European countries, an exception was made for the Soviet Union. Economic and political instability led to migration from East to West Germany. Between 1949 and 1961, 2.7 million people moved from East to West. This included many skilled workers and professionals, further damaging East Germany's economy and relations between the East and West.

On December 21, 1972, the two Germany states signed the Basic Treaty that would govern all relations between East and West Germany. This treaty essentially recognized and made official the post-war status quo divisions of Germany. Limited diplomatic recognition followed later that year.

Although the Basic Treaty made great strides in improving relations and increasing communication between the two countries, tensions continued during the next decade over interpretation of the provision in the treaty. The Basic Treaty establishes quasi-normal relations but does not resolve all problems or the legal status of the two states. West Germany abandoned claiming sole rights to represent German interest and citizens and recognized the existence of an East Germany entity. There were, however, disagreements about what constituted German citizenship and the existence of a single German state. The two countries exchanged diplomatic missions but West Germany did not grant full diplomatic recognition. 

East Germany had sought recognition of two fully independent states and full diplomatic recognition but did not get these things from the basic law. Despite these disagreements, the 1972 treaty does mark the beginning of a period of detente between the two countries. In the coming years, West Germany sought to intensify relations with East German in areas such as trade, technology, communications, and travel between the two states. East Germany, in many ways, saw this level of integration as a threat to their hold over East German society. 

The Helsinki Accords in 1975 mark the peak and beginning decline of both East-West detente and East and West German relations. Fear that western influences and pressures from dissenters to enact the human rights provisions in the Helsinki Accords pushed East Germany to crack down, repressing dissent, enforcing strict travel restrictions, fortifying the border with West Germany and intensifying hostile rhetoric with the west. Detente between East and West officially comes to an end with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the Polish Crisis in 1980. Although relations between East and West Germany did not degrade to the level of the Soviet and US, there were some negative repercussions for the two German states. Travel between the two countries, steadily growing during the 1970s, dropped dramatically after the Polish Crisis in 1980. Open lines of communications between the two governments were also disrupted.

By 1989, there is massive domestic upheaval in East Germany. Starting in the fall of 1989, there are open protests against the East German government and citizens fleeing the country to West Germany. In October of 1989 the leader of the East German state, Erich Honecker, resigns. The Berlin Wall is officially dismantled by the East German government in June of 1990 and the two countries were officially reunited on October 3, 1990.

The period of May 1955, official independence of West Germany, to 1961 can be characterized by low-level conflict. West Germany refused to recognize the existence of East Germany and initiated efforts to isolate and destabilize the country. In 1961, with the building of the Berlin Wall, Riv729 begins lasts until 1972. In 1972, the two countries sign the Basic Treaty that normalizes relations between the two. The relationship is no longer a rivalry but is still characterized by low-level conflict. Interactions increase, as trade, travel, and general communications between the two grows in frequency. The tone of the relationship, however, is still generally hostile as West Germany fails to grant full diplomatic recognition and East Germany, to some extent, views the increasing contact between East and West as a threat to their stability and control over East German citizens. The brief detente begins to disappear after 1975, when East Germany begins to feel pressures to reform human rights. In 1979 and 1980, relations again begin to degrade with the heating up of hostilities between the Soviet Union and the United States. 

19890702-19901003 Transition

The period of low-level conflict begins to transition in 1989 when domestic protests force the East German government to step down and travel restrictions are lifted between East and West Germany. In October of 1990 the two countries are reunified.
