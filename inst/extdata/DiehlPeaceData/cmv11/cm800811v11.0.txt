PS-UPDATE2020: Clear shift away from lesser rivalry to negative peace commencing on December 17, 2015, when Cambodia’s PM made the first visit to Thailand in 14 years, signaling a “new chapter” in relations (https://www.khmertimeskh.com/33782/hun-sen-visits-thailand/) •	“Nattawut Pothisaro, Thai ambassador to Cambodia, said the two countries have agreed to put controversial issues aside in a bid to restore ties and "focus on positive issues" ((https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1094949/ties-with-cambodia-enter-new-chapter)) this is followed by subsequence cooperation in several areas. •	2018: both countries agree to step up defense cooperation: https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/a-new-thailand-cambodia-military-boost/ •	2019: the reopening of the rail and sea links, bolstering diplomatic and economic ties: https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Thailand-and-Cambodia-reopen-rail-and-sea-links-as-ties-blossom o	“In October 2018, the two countries also signed an agreement to link ports to strengthen cooperation over tourism. They intend to connect Thailand's Koh Samui, a resort island in the Gulf of Thailand, with a port that Cambodia plans to begin building near the southern city of Kampot late this year or early 2020”

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1226 coded non-territorial because although Preah Vihear temple is disputed, this was not an attempt to occupy territory or use force to address dispute. From cm narrative, Thailand declared a state of emergency along the Cambodian border in response to Cambodia establishing diplomatic relations with China. Thailand feared a communist infiltration into Thailand. Cambodia refused Thailand's offer to allow visitors to the Preah Vihear temple, and then blew up bridges. Occurred 8/1958-9/1959.

TERRMID-CER: MID1227 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1227 is centered on the Preah Vihear temple. Cambodia suspected that Thailand would violate their sovereignty over the Preah Vihear temple, prompting strained relations and eventual severing of diplomatic relations. Occurred from June through December of 1961. From cr narrative.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1227 2 -- somewhat uncertain 
CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1227 preceded the Cambodian Civil War by several years, but was centered on the Preah Vihear temple, a long-standing territorial dispute that was independent of any concerns of civil war activity. CR narrative indicates that "insurgent activity [in Cambodia] fueled [Cambodia's] suspicions" that Thailand would take advantage of strained military resources in Cambodia to make an opportunistic invasion of the disputed area, but this does not constitute a MID that was driven by actual civil war events. Basically, Cambodia was wary of perceptions of its own weakness and seemed to attempt to show resolve by engaging in events that constitute MID1227.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1228 From cr narrative, MID1228 is centered on the Preah Vihear temple. The two parties submitted the case to the ICJ, which ruled in 1962 that Cambodia had sole sovereignty over the temple. Thailand protested this decision and erected a barbed wire fence to prevent Cambodia from reclaiming it. Thailand eventually complied, but both sides made minor incursions into the territory shortly thereafter. Occurred from June through November of 1962.

TERRMID-CER: MID1216 1 -- certain
TERRMID-NOTES: MID1216 From cm narrative, MID1216 is a multilateral MID involving China and Cambodia versus US, Thailand, and South Vietnam. In response to Cambodia allowing Vietnamese communist rebels to set up bases along the Vietnamese border, US, Thai, and Vietnamese forces entered Cambodian territory to pursue the rebels. Most relevant here is that, during this dispute, Thai forces attacked and occupied the Preah Vihear temple (April 1966).

MID2938

TERRMID: MID2938 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID2938 2 -- somewhat certain
TERRMID-NOTES: MID2938 appears to be a result of the tensions regarding the Preah Vihear temple. The navies of the two countries exchanged fire on Feb 4, 1969. This seems to be a routine display/use of force that reflects the unresolved territorial dispute and signals the resolve of both parties to uphold their claim. Coded somewhat uncertain because no specific reason by either country was given for the exchange, but there is good reason to believe that this was over the territorial dispute. With the exception of MID1216 (multilateral Vietnam war MID), all previous MIDs were over the Preah Vihear temple, and many following MIDs were over the temple. There is no evidence that this clash was driven by rebel activity in Cambodia (CIVWARMIDs and TERRMIDs are the two primary types of MIDs in this dyad).

MARITMID-NOTES: MID2938 From cm narrative, Cambodian and Thai navies exchanged fire, with no deaths reported. However, no evidence could be found (Keesings, Facts on File, NYT Historical Archives) that this was dispute was over maritime boundary issues, or that one country had violated the maritime sovereignty of the other. Coded somewhat certain because no specific information could be found regarding the reason for the exchange of fire, but there is good reason to believe it was over the Preah Vihear territorial dispute and is thus most likely a TERRMID (see TERRMID-NOTES).

CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID2938 occurred during the Cambodian Civil War, but there is no evidence that this clash was driven by rebel activities in either country. Rather, it seems to be associated with the long-running tension over the Preah Vihear temple. Coded somewhat certain because we do not have specific information about the reason for this exchange of naval fire, but it seems to be the case that it was driven by Preah Vihear, not any rebel activity. All CIVWARMIDs in this dyad involved clashes/exchanges of fire on land, not between navies.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID1231 From cm narrative, following the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975, relations with surrounding states were tense, and Cambodia had several land and sea disputes with Thailand, including the still-unresolved Preah Vihear temple and maritime boundaries. Numerous border clashes occurred that comprise part of MID1231. Occurred from May of 1975 until February of 1976. Coded not territory because Cambodian forces crossed into Thailand to fight in Surin province on June 24, 1975, and several border clashes followed soon after (NARRATIVE-CM), but does not seem to be the case that this was over the territorial dispute of the Preah Vihear temple. Rather, these seem to be driven by general hostility between the regimes rather than connected directly to their territorial dispute. The sites of the border clashes were not disputed territory.

MARITMID-NOTES: MID1231 from narrative, following the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975, relations with surrounding states were tense, and Cambodia had several land and sea disputes with Thailand. The events of this MID occurred from 5/1975-2/1976. Both countries had formally claimed overlapping maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Thailand, the site of the maritime clashes in this MID. Thailand had formally declared its maritime boundary in the gulf in 1973 (not fully delimited until 1997), and Cambodia had formally filed its first claim in 1972 (fully delimited in 1997). During the events of MID1231, these claims were overlapping. Coded maritime MID because 1) maritime claims where the hostilities occurred were overlapping, 2) Cambodia's hostility toward its neighbors during this time resulted in several clashes that constituted violations of territorial sovereignty, and 2) on May 29, 1975, Cambodia fired on Thai fishing vessels that crossed into Cambodian waters, one of the events that constitute this MID (from NARRATIVE-CM).

Thailand and Cambodia exchanged hostilities over the disputed Preah Vihear temple area, which is owned by Cambodia, but nominally claimed by Thailand. The MID began when Thailand deployed almost 1,000 troops to occupy and assert control over the region. The troops remained in the region for an unknown amount of time. Aside from this occupation, the MID is mostly characterized by small-arms and artillery clashes between military forces of the two states over the border near the disputed region, with Thailand seeking to attain control of the temple area and Cambodia seeking to prevent incursions and occupations by Thai troops. First day of dispute was on 7/15/2008 and last day of dispute was on 10/29/2010.

NARRATIVE-CM:
Cambodia and Thailand disputed the sovereignty of the Temple of Preah Vihear and surrounding border region after Thai police occupied the temple in December 1953. A crisis emerged between Cambodia and Thailand on July 24, 1958 when Cambodia established diplomatic relations with the *People's Republic of China* (PRC). Cambodia declared a state-of-emergency on the border on August 4, 1958. Cambodia temporarily suspended diplomatic relations with Thailand on November 24, 1958 following the apprehension of 32 inhabitants of a Thai village in the disputed region by Cambodian police on November 20, 1958. Cambodia severed diplomatic relations with Thailand on November 24, 1958, and Thailand recalled its ambassador to Cambodia on November 25, 1958. Cambodia accused Thailand of mobilizing troops near the border. Cambodia referred the matter to *United Nations* (UN) Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold on December 3, 1958. Cambodia and Thailand requested the appointment of an UN mediator. The UN secretary-general announced the appointment of Johan Beck-Friis of Sweden as special representative to the region on December 22, 1958. Johan Beck-Friis facilitated an end to the crisis on February 6, 1959, when Cambodia and Thailand agreed to resume diplomatic relations. Cambodia also agreed to release the Thai nationals apprehended in November 1958. Cambodia submitted the Temple of Preah Vihear dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) on October 6, 1959. The ICJ issued a decision on June 15, 1962, which upheld Cambodian sovereignty over the dispute temple. Thailand accepted the decision under protest on June 21, 1962, and Thai troops withdrew from the area on July 15, 1962. Cambodia accused Thailand of military aggression in the border region in August 1962. The UN secretary-general appointed Nils Gussin of Sweden as his special representative in the dispute on October 19, 1962.

NARRATIVE-CR:
Relations between Thailand and Cambodia have been tense for centuries. For long periods, Thailand occupied Cambodian territory. The two states also encountered ideological differences in the Cold War and mixed border populations. Much of the initial conflict in the rivalry centered on the disputed sovereignty of the Khmer Temple of Preah Vihear. This is a Buddhist temple on territory occupied and controlled by Thailand but traditionally controlled by Cambodia. The temple is technically located in the northernmost tip of Cambodia but it is only easily accessible from northeast Thailand. 

MID1225 occurred November of 1953 through May of 1954. When the French withdrew from Cambodia in 1953, Thai police forces immediately occupied the site of the ancient Khmer Temple of Preah Vihear. Sovereignty over the territory around the temple had been disputed by Cambodia and Thailand even prior to the French occupation of Indochina. Cambodia immediately challenged Thailand's claim to the temple and surrounding land. 

MID1226 occurred from August of 1958 until February of 1959. On 24 July, the Cambodian government established diplomatic relations with the PRC. Thailand feared communist infiltration and declared a state of emergency on the Cambodian border on 8 August. Thailand concentrated troops and military equipment along their common border in the vicinity. This cut off access of Cambodian visitors to the Khmer Temple of Preah Vihear. Thailand offered to allow Cambodian visitors to the temple but Cambodia refused the offer. Thailand then blew up bridges on the border. Cambodia feared Thai involvement in internal affairs of Cambodia. Cambodia suspended diplomatic relations with Thailand in November 1958. 

MID1227 occurred from June through December of 1961. Here again the Khmer Temple of Preah Vihear is the issue. France granted two Cambodian provinces, Siem Reap and Batambang to Thailand in 1941. They were restored to Cambodia in 1946, but Cambodian President Sihanouk believed that without international recognition, Thailand might attempt to recover the provinces. Insurgent activity in the area fueled Sihanouk's suspicions. This border dispute simmered until 1961 when relations were strained over Preah Vihear. During this period diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed. 

MID1228 occurred from June through November of 1962. This dispute also concerned tensions over the Temple of Preah Vihear. In June, the International Court of Justice rules that the Temple was located in Cambodia and ordered Thailand to withdraw its troops and restore any objects removed from the Temple. Thailand vigorously protested this ruling and erected a barbed wire fence around the temple to prevent Cambodia from reclaiming it. Thailand had other pressing issues at the time as it was concerned over communist activity throughout Southeast Asia and did not want to alienate the US. Therefore, it complied with the ruling and withdrew its troops. During this period, there were minor military incursions into the territory near the temple by both sides. 

MID2623 occurred from July through November of 1963. This dispute also revolved around the sovereignty of the Khmer Temple of Preah Vihear and involved minor military incidents. 

MID1229 occurred from April of 1964 until January of 1966. Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a UN special commission to assist them in resolving their border disagreement in December of 1962. Minor military incidents continued during the representative's work and the commission was discontinued in 1964. The 1965-1966 period was particularly violent for the rivalry. During this period approximately 300 people are said to have died. In June of 1965 a small Cambodian force provoked a minor battle on the Thai side of the border. During this period, the center of the conflict is sovereignty over the Temple of Preah Vihear.

MID2624 or the Koh Kon Island dispute occurred from the end of December 1964 until the beginning of January 1965. Thai Interior Undersecretary Phuang Suwannarat charged January 5 that 15 Cambodian soldiers had crossed into Thai territorial waters in a patrol vessel December 27, 1964, had seized a fishing boat and had killed 4 of the 5 Thai crewmen. The fifth was drowned in the fight. Thailand filed a complaint with the UN, and Cambodia denied the charge January 8. 

MID1216 occurred from December of 1965 until August of 1965. This MID is a multilateral MID involving China and Cambodia on one side with Thailand, South Vietnam and the US on the other. Here the hostility centers on Cambodia. After cultivating close relations with the US in 1963, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk cancelled all military and economic aid from the US and broke off diplomatic relations with the US in 1965. He felt the Vietnamese Communists in South Vietnam were eventually going to win the struggle for power and entered into a compromise agreement with them. He allowed the communist rebels in South Vietnam, the NLF, and the North Vietnamese Army to set up bases along the Cambodian border with South Vietnam. He also permitted the receipt of shipments from China and the USSR at Cambodia's main port. Prince Sihanouk got in return the pledge that the Vietnamese would respect Cambodian independence. Additionally he received a pledge that the Vietnamese would not support the Khmer Rouge insurgency that was opposing the Prince. The US along with its allies Thailand and South Vietnam made several incursions into Cambodia in pursuit of Communist forces. In this MID Cambodia made threats to make reprisal attacks and implicitly called on China for assistance in threats to the US. During April of 1966 Thailand attacked and reoccupied the Temple of Preah Vihear. Though the dispute has other elements to it this issue took place during this period between Cambodia and Thailand. 

MID1230 occurred in June and July of 1967. MID1610 occurred in June, July and August of 1968. Both of these MIDs were disputes revolving around the sovereignty of the Temple of Preah Vihear.

MID2938 occurred on February 4, 1969. Here the navies of the two countries engaged in an exchange of fire with no death reported. 

MID1605 occurred from March through June of 1970. Here again the two countries square off over the Temple of Preah Vihear in a series of minor military incidents. 

MID1231 occurred from May of 1975 until February of 1976. The Khmer Rouge took power in 1975. The new regime renamed the state the Democratic Kampuchea was hostile to foreigner and relations with the surrounding states were tense. During December of 1975 a number of incidents took place along ht Thai-Cambodian border and in the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodian gunboats attacked two Thai fishhing vessels in Cambodian waters on May 29, 1975. A Cambodian gunboat and a Thai patrol boat clashed on June 12, 1975. Cambodian troops and Thai police clashed in Surin Province in Thailand on June 24, 1975, resulting in the deaths of five Cambodians. Cambodian troops and Thai border police clashed near the border in the Ta Phraya district on December 12-15, 1975, resulting in the deaths of three Cambodian soldiers and two Thai police officers. Cambodian troops and Thai border police clashed near the border on January 6, 1976, resulting in the death of one Thai policeman. 

MID1232 occurred from August of 1976 until June of 1987. This was a multilateral MID with North Vietnam aiding Cambodia after its invasion into Cambodia in 1980. This MID covers a series of hostile actions between the two regimes over a 9-year period. The Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot took power in Cambodia in 1975. The Khmer Rouge government began violent domestic repression in 1975, including forced evacuation of major cities. Khmer Rouge forces pursued refugees across the border into Thailand as early as November of 1976. In July of 1977, Thai aircraft began retaliatory strikes against Cambodia. Khmer Rouge units also raided villages within Vietnam in March of 1977. Vietnam responded by air strikes. Vietnam mounted a full-scale invasion in late 1978. Vietnamese troops and Cambodian forces began small raids on Khmer bases in Thailand and continued these operations until 1987. 

MID4001 took place from January of 1994 until September of 1996. A source of friction between Cambodia and Thailand is the support that Thailand still provided to the Khmer Rouge guerillas encamped along the border between the two countries. During this period Pol Pot and his comrades conducted operations in this region while gaining support from Thai political and business leaders. To finance their operations the Khmer Rouge sold valuable timber and gems to the Thai across the border. The Cambodians accused Thailand of aiding Pol Pot in his escape. 

MID4135 occurred from August 15 1997 through May 2, 1998. During this period, warring factions within Cambodia fought near the Thai border. Mr. Hun Sen, leader of one of the rival factions was attempting to crush guerilla opposition in the region. His armed forces fired artillery shells that landed in Thai territory. The Thai army responded by returning the salvos. Members of the militaries of both sides were killed in the incidents. 

Bilateral relations with Thailand came under strain following attacks (January 29, 2003) on the Thai Embassy and Thai businesses in Cambodia. This followed rumors that a Thai actress had said Angkor Wat rightfully belonged to Thailand, giving rise to old sensitivities. However, political relations appear largely restored, with the two countries having held a Joint Cabinet meeting on 31 May 2003 (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2003).

Prior to this and in recent years, Cambodia's relationship with Thailand had seen some improvement-particularly at senior political levels. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin visited Phnom Penh on 18-19 June 2001. At the time this was an important step towards strengthening bilateral economic cooperation. In the past, the relationship has been complicated by the presence on the Thai-Cambodia land border of refugees and groups involved in armed resistance to the Cambodian Government-as well as disagreement over disputed waters in the Gulf of Thailand. Illegal harvesting of Cambodian timber in the border areas has also been an irritant in the relationship. (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 2003)

Cambodia / Thailand Years: 1953-Present. Issues at stake: Exact border between Cambodia and Thailand, including: 1) to 1970, Thai claims to Preah Vihear temple and surrounding region; 2) claims to Koh Kong island in the Gulf of Thailand; 3) after 1976, Cambodian claims to several border villages and areas. Also control over border incursions by various rebel groups. End coding: Continuing as of 1988 with no accepted settlement. Number of reciprocated 30 day militarized disputes: 8. Last militarized dispute: As recent as 1987. Wars: None. Summary: The initial stages of the rivalry between Cambodia and Thailand center around Thai efforts to regain territory lost to French in the 1800s as they expanded their Southeast-Asian colonial empire. After WWII France retained control over its colonies in the region, but quickly became caught up in Vietnam. Thailand took advantage of French involvement to press its claims, but the French were able to resist those claims until Cambodia was granted independence in 1953. During the French withdrawal from Cambodia in 1953, Thailand occupied the Preah Vihear temple. This marks the beginning of the rivalry. A series of clashes followed through the 1950s and 1960s, the most serious from 1964 through 1966 when the temple was recaptured first by the Cambodians and then by Thailand in the course of several months of fighting. In 1962 the International Court of Justice ruled that the temple was within Cambodian territory. Thailand finally accepted that ruling in 1970 when it withdrew its claims to Preah Vihear and declared its willingness to accept Cambodian borders. This agreement was supposedly reached in return for additional Cambodian aid against Vietnamese forces acting in Laos. Fairly peaceful relations followed through the mid-1970s, but ended with the Cambodian Civil War. In 1976, soon after the new Cambodian regime came to power, Thailand announced an agreement on border demarcation and diplomatic recognition of the new Cambodian government. However, a number of disputes followed starting in 1977. These disputes first concerned the movement of, and support for, various guerrilla groups along the Cambodian-Thai border. Starting in 1977, Cambodia made claims to a number of border villages. Sporadic fighting in those border regions has continued, and the border remains unclear. Notes: It is somewhat unclear how related the post-1970 conflicts and border issues are to the previous issue of control over Preah Vihear. Thailand gave up its claim to Preah Vihear in 1970, and relations between Cambodia and Thailand improved. However, after several border incidents beginning somewhere between 1975 and 1977, Cambodia made claims that certain border villages were actually within Cambodia. Sources suggest there are differing maps of the region and that a real dispute still exists. It seems that the border issues in dispute before 1970 and after 1975 are related, since all of the claims rely on conflicting historical maps, and the rivalry has therefore continued beyond 1970.

PS-NARRATIVE: 

19980503-20030410 Transition

The last MID of RIV1349, MID4135 occurred from August 15 1997 through May 2, 1998. During this period, warring factions within Cambodia fought near the Thai border. Mr. Hun Sen, leader of one of the rival factions was attempting to crush guerilla opposition in the region. His armed forces fired artillery shells that landed in Thai territory. The Thai army responded by returning the salvos. Members of the militaries of both sides were killed in the incidents. In recent years, Cambodia's relationship with Thailand had seen some improvement-particularly at senior political levels. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin visited Phnom Penh on 18-19 June 2001. At the time this was an important step towards strengthening bilateral economic cooperation.

Cambodia and Thailand are considering creating open trade areas along their border to increase economic activity on both sides and crack down on crime, officials said on November 6, 1999. Delegations from both countries, led by Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and his Thai counter-part Sanan Kajornprasart discussed implementing a 1997 border-crossing agreement during three days of talks in Pattaya, Thailand. "We discussed plans to make it easier for people along the border to earn a living by allowing them to cross on each side," Sar Kheng told reporters at Phnom Penh's international airport upon returning home. "We also discussed strengthening security along the border, especially border provinces." A joint press statement said officials also discussed ways to promote cooperation and understanding in regard to the border, the demarcation of which has been in dispute for decades. The statement said both countries hoped to improve the standard of living of Cambodians and Thais living in border areas, and cooperate in economic activities, education and public health.

Cambodia and Thailand opened talks on June 5, 2000, in an effort to resolve their long-lasting border conflict. At the talks, both sides expressed their optimism that the border conflict will be resolved. Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Thai deputy foreign minister, led the Thai delegation while his Cambodian counterpart, Var Kimhong, headed the Cambodian side. This is the second meeting of the Cambodian-Thai Joint Commission on Demarcation of Land Boundary. The first one was held in Thailand the previous year. Cambodia claims that Thailand has encroached some parts of its 803-kilometer borderlines in its northern and western parts. At least four provinces of Koh Kong, Pursat, Battambang and Banteay Meanchey have been invaded by Thailand, Cambodia charged in a report issued before the meeting. The meeting takes place just days ahead of Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's visit to Cambodia from June 14 to 16, 2000. The border demarcation between the two countries was determined in the late 1910s during the French colonial regime in which 73 border posts were erected, but it is unclear how many of them remain today, Var Kimhong told reporters. "The delay in the examination on the border conflict was caused by three decades of civil war, insecurity along the border and land mines," he said. Var Kimhong, however, said the border checking will be started by the end of the year if the two sides agree at this meeting.

Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai left Bangkok on June 14, 2000, for a three-day visit to Cambodia on a mission aimed mainly at mending fences-especially those along their common border. Chuan-accompanied by Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and Telecommunications Minister Suthep Thuaksuban-will witness the signing of two bilateral agreements and one memorandum of understanding in Phnom Penh. The two governments are also scheduled to sign pacts on cooperation in the return of stolen vehicles, a concern for Thailand, and on combating illicit trafficking and cross-border smuggling of cultural artifacts, a concern for Cambodia. Ministers will also sign a memorandum of understanding on the demarcation of their common border, said Thai Foreign Ministry sources. Chuan is expected to raise concerns with his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen about the proliferation of casinos on Cambodia's side of the border, aimed at attracting gamblers from Thailand, where casinos are banned. Bangkok is particularly upset about a new casino recently built in the town of Poi Pet, because the developer has allegedly altered the course of a canal which defines the border.Thai-Cambodian border conflicts today, however, are minor compared to what they were two decades ago, when the area was a war zone between Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh troops and Western and China-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas.

Cambodian and Thai officials signed a tourism cooperation agreement on July 28, 2000, designed to promote the two countries as a destination package. "The concept is two kingdoms, one destination," Cambodian Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth said at the signing ceremony with Adisai Bodharamik, a senior Thai cabinet minister. Cambodia hopes the program will help lure some of the Thailand's 8-10 million tourists per year to visit the famed Angkor temples in northwest Cambodia and also Phnom Penh, he said. The two countries are in negotiations with airlines and tour agents to package Thailand-Cambodia trips together. "We're examining ways to reduce prices," Veng Sereyvuth said. Bangkok is already seen as a "gateway" city, with 45 per cent of tourist arrivals in Cambodia travelling from Bangkok. Thailand's tourism industry has been thriving for years, but Cambodia has lagged behind because of the bloody civil war that tore the country apart for decades. With the war now over, the country is looking to tourism as a boost to its weak economy. Tourist arrivals are up 40 per cent for the first six months of 2000, to 166,000. Cambodia hopes to attract 1 million tourists per year by 2003, more than triple last year's figures.

Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen invited the new formally-elected Thai premier to Cambodia to improve relations between the neighboring states, he said on February 10, 2001. Prime Minister Hun Sen extended an invitation to Thailand's Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was formally elected as the country's new premier on Friday after his party won the general election last month, according to a letter obtained by Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "I have the honor to invite Your Excellency to visit Cambodia," Prime Minister Hun Sen said. "I am fully confident that Your Excellency's visit will further contribute to better understanding, mutual trust and goodwill for the common interests of our countries." Border issues between Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand have been some of the most sensitive for Cambodian officials, who often blame porous borders as the source of violations or encroachments by military units, logging and mining companies, and drug exporters.

Thailand and Cambodia signed a raft of agreements on June 18, 2001, to jointly explore for oil along their shared coastline and step up economic, humanitarian and anti-crime cooperation. Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who left his domestic woes behind to visit Cambodia as part of a mini-tour of the region, met with his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen while their respective ministers conferred on a variety of topics. Thaksin dashed here after making an emotional closing address to his corruption trial at the Constitutional Court in Bangkok, which will soon begin deliberating allegations he hid part of his assets in an official filing. Among the agreements signed after a series of closed-door meetings was a memorandum of understanding to explore for oil a 24,000-square-kilometer (9,600-square-mile) area off the coastal border of Thailand and Cambodia. Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai and Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong inked the agreement that would have their countries share equally the cost of exploration and profits from any subsequent drilling. Surakiart and Hor Namhong discussed plans to mutually fight crime and drug trafficking along their shared border while joining in fishery and reforestation projects. They also discussed the improvement of a road linking Thailand and Cambodia, ways of boosting tourism between the two countries and renewed efforts to rid the border area of landmines. Thai government spokesman Yonguth Tiyatairat said Cambodia had also asked for additional flights from Thailand to provide an infusion of tourist dollars. Cambodia requested assistance from Thailand for healthcare for villagers living in the border region, where landmines continue to be a common hazard. "Thailand and Cambodia will find a way to further demining," said Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Bahn. "We will coordinate in demining. We will provide information about where mines are to prevent danger for the people." During the visit, Thailand donated medical supplies to Cambodia along with a pick-up truck and five motorcycles.

Cambodian officials are negotiating a new border crossing in Preah Vihear after Thai authorities closed the checkpoint at the foot of the province's prized temple complex last month, officials said on January 14, 2002. Local officials from Preah Vihear, where famous 8th to 11th century Khmer ruins are located, were meeting with their Thai counterparts across the border in Sisaket to negotiate the new border pass, officials said. The proposed crossing, 7 kilometres east of the temple at Tathav pass in Choam Ksan district, would replace the temple checkpoint that was closed by Thailand after a dispute over the poor sanitation of some nearby Cambodian settlers, officials said. "We want to change the direction of tourists who go straight to the temples," said Long Sovan, 2nd Vice Governor of Preah Vihear. "We want them to spend more time in Cambodia." "If the talks are successful, the Cambodian and Thais will be able to exchange commercial and agricultural goods there," he said. Cambodian officials have said a border crossing at Tathav pass could be as important as the heavily-trafficked crossing at Poipet, in Banteay Meanchey province. The delegation of local Cambodian officials, who were negotiating under the authority of the national government, departed for Thailand the previous day and was scheduled to return later this week, officials said. Thai authorities closed passage to the Preah Vihear temples over allegations that vendors near the ruins were polluting a river on the border for Thai residents living downstream. Cambodian officials and military commanders, who say that Thailand has erected barbed wire barriers to the temple, have refuted claims that they have added troops to the 1,000 Cambodian police and military stationed at the border. Perceived attempts to encroach on the country's Buddhist and Hindu temples, a source of tremendous pride for most Cambodians, is an extremely sensitive issue that has racked relations with Thailand for decades. Preah Vihear was the site of a 1960s territorial dispute between Cambodia and Thailand that was finally settled in favour of Cambodia by the World Court in the Hague. A senior tourism ministry official was sacked last July following accusations that he signing an agreement with the Thai tourism ministry allowing the country to manage tourist facilities at the temple, a World Heritage site also known as Phra Viharn. The removal of the tourism official capped long-simmering allegations that Cambodian tourism officials were planning to handover control of the mountain temples.

Cambodia has closed its border with Thailand to protest the unequal relationship between the neighbors, Prime Minister Hun Sen said on March 6, 2003, also threatening to develop trade ties with other nations. "Due to economic inequality Cambodians have a right to go into Thailand to buy their products, but Thais have no right to sell their products in Cambodia," the prime minister told villagers during a strongly nationalistic speech at the opening of a hospital in northwestern Siem Reap province. "In such a situation there is no justice in terms of bilateral trade," he said. "Doing such a thing is just like Cambodians going to beg." Cambodia summarily closed its border checkpoints with Thailand citing unspecified security reasons. Thailand shut its border to Cambodians immediately after the January 29, 2003, anti-Thai riots in Phnom Penh, but on February 8, 2003, allowed them to cross into the country on foot for day visits. The kingdom also stopped its nationals from crossing into Cambodia and has not yet relaxed its ban. Impoverished Cambodia is heavily dependent on purchasing everyday necessities from its richer neighbor, while many Thais cross into Cambodia to gamble at casinos located there. Hun Sen said: "If Cambodia and Thailand do not have an agreement to allow the people to cross the border normally, it is not necessary for us to cross into Thailand." He said Cambodia had survived for almost three decades with its border with Thailand closed, referring to the period of the Cambodian civil war, which was formally ended in 1998. "Cambodia could do business with (many other countries)," Hun Sen said, possibly increasing trade with other Asian countries including Malaysia, Singapore, China and Vietnam. "This time we need to save our people's lives and dignity. We should think about business (with Thailand) later," he said. The prime minister said the border was also closed due to security concerns over Thailand's three-month self-declared drugs war, which started on February 1 and has already left more than 1,100 dead. He said he had received reports of three Cambodian people being shot dead by Thai border guards and two being wounded in three separate incidents in February. "I am very concerned about the security of Cambodian people who enter Thailand to conduct their business. They could be killed in operations against drugs," he said. "As the prime minister of a sovereign state, I have a duty to protect my people from being in danger." Thailand downgraded diplomatic relations with Cambodia to the charge d'affaires level in the wake of the riots and has yet to restore them. Hun Sen said Cambodia's measures to appease the Thais after the attacks-apologizing over the riots, pledging compensation and arresting some perpetrators-should have already been considered sufficient. "We have used all measures possible (to reply to Thai demands)," he said. "We did what Thailand told us to do and we bowed our head to the ground and I think that was enough." Cambodia is heading for national elections in July and nationalistic rhetoric usually increases among political leaders during poll periods.

On March 9, 2003, the Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said Cambodian pressure on Thailand to restore relations will not work, especially since damages for the anti-Thai riots in January have not been paid. "Compensation has not yet happened, the private sector has not yet received any compensation, nor the Thai embassy," Thaksin said. `We want to restore relations (but) if they think they can threaten or put pressure on Thailand to act... under my prime ministership, no way," he said. Thaksin was reacting in his weekly radio address to Phnom Penh's abrupt order stopping Cambodians from crossing into Thailand, where thousands of them usually buy goods daily on day passes. Thailand downgraded ties with Cambodia after the January 29, 2003 riots in Phnom Penh, which destroyed the Thai embassy and several Thai-owned interests. It also stopped its nationals from crossing into Cambodia, where they make up most of the visitors to casinos near the border, but allowed Cambodians to enter Thailand from February 8, 2003. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has said Cambodia had taken several steps, such as making arrests, to normalize ties. "We had done what Thailand told us to do and we had bowed our head to the ground and I think that was enough," he said.

Cambodia and Thailand agreed on April 11, 2003 to restore diplomatic ties, which were suspended after anti-Thai riots raged through the Cambodian capital in January 2003. "We have come to the stage that we will send ambassadors to each other's countries," said Thai Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai. Angry Cambodians vandalized Thailand's embassy and razed Thai-owned businesses in Phnom Penh on Jan. 29 following rumors that a Thai television actress had made insulting remarks about Cambodia's Angkor temples, a symbol of national pride. Thailand closed border crossings with Cambodia, withdrew its ambassador and ordered Phnom Penh's envoy in Bangkok to leave. Cambodia later paid US$5.9 million for damage to the Thai Embassy. Thai companies still want 2 billion baht (US$46.8 million) for damaged businesses in Phnom Penh. Cambodia says the claims must be individually reviewed.

The first Thai-Cambodian joint Cabinet retreat was held on 31 May and 1 June 2003. This marked a thaw in the often difficult relations between the two neighbors. Specific solutions on how to deal with the still disputed Preah Vihear Temple emerged during this meeting.

Thaksin Shinawatra, prime minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, and Samdech Hun Sen, prime minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, at the Summit Meeting on Economic Cooperation Strategy (ECS) among the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Union of Myanmar Burma , and the Kingdom of Thailand, held in Bagan from 11-12 November 2003, officially announced the opening of three new international points of entry between Thailand and Cambodia following border crossing facilitation effective on 11 November 2003 as part of the bilateral cooperation between the two countries.

On March 9, 2004, Thailand and Cambodia concluded an agreement on trade cooperation, which would lead to the reduction of trade barriers and increase in bilateral trade between the two neighboring countries, according to Commerce Minister Watana Muangsook. Watana told TNA that the agreement was reached at the First Joint Thai-Cambodian Trade Commission (JTC) Meeting, held here today. "At the First JTC Meeting, hosted by the Department of Trade Negotiations, Thailand and Cambodia agreed to jointly address trade problems and to reduce trade obstacles between the two countries, he stated. "The two neighboring countries will sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the bilateral trade cooperation soon, with a statement on details of the MOU to be also issued" he disclosed. Watana said, however, that the MOU would cover six agreed frameworks, including trade and investment facilitations, border trade, cross-border transport, a joint panel to work out on a joint Thai-Cambodian economic cooperation, a research project on the establishment of a central market on wholesale and exports in Cambodia, and the establishment of a special economic zone. "The new agreement with Cambodia is hoped to not only reduce trade barriers and address other trade problems between Thailand and Cambodia, but also help boost the country's trade and investment with all four new ASEAN members as a whole", he projected. In 2003, Thai exports to Cambodia accounted for US $ 685.4 million, an increase of 32.8% from the previous year, with fuel, motorcycles and parts, beverages, cement, and chemical products being on top of the export list; while imports from Cambodia stood at US $ 12.3 million, an increase of 10.8% from the previous year, according to the commerce minister. Cambodia is Thailand's 31st trading partner; while Thailand is Cambodia's 23rd trading partner. Cambodia is, however, Thailand's seventh trading partner in the 10-nation ASEAN.

The issue on Thailand-Cambodia Joint Development of Preah Vihear Temple was discussed at a meeting between Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai and Mr. Sok An, Senior Minister in charge of the Council of Ministers of Cambodia. The meeting took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Bangkok on 25 March 2004, when both sides agreed that the joint development of Preah Vihear Temple would be a symbol of the long-lasting friendship, based on mutual benefit and understanding, between the two countries. The project was a result of the first Thai-Cambodian joint Cabinet retreat, held on 31 May and 1 June 2003. After the retreat, both Thailand and Cambodia formed their own committees to carry out the project. On the part of Thailand, the committee is chaired by Foreign Minister Surakiart and comprises representatives of various government agencies. Two subcommittees were set up: one to be responsible for renovating Preah Vihear Temple and the other for planning the joint development project. Thailand and Cambodia agreed to restore this hilltop Khmer sanctuary to preserve its beauty and artistic, historical, and archaeological values in an effort to make it a worthy addition to mankind's heritage. The restoration program will be conducted jointly with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), after it accepts a proposal to listPreah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site. Thailand and Cambodia also agreed to cooperate in resolving the existing major issues affecting the lives of people living in the area, such as environmental problems and the de-mining operation at Preah Vihear Temple and its vicinity. For other countries benefit as well, the joint development of Preah Vihear Temple will be linked with other regional development frameworks, such as the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Makong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS), the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Development, and the Emerald Triangle. Foreign Minister Surakiart said that participation and assistance from third parties, such as international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, in the joint development of Preah Vihear Temple would be welcomed. He revealed that Thailand and Cambodia agreed in principle that a joint survey of the border area would be conducted to collect data for future demarcation. Both sides would prevent the demarcation issue from causing obstacles to the joint development project. A plan of action would be developed in a systematic manner to ensure the effective implementation of the project. Preah Vihear Temple was built between the 11th and 13th centuries and dedicated to the Hindu God Siva. It is located on the Phanom Dongrak Mountain in Kantharalak District of Si Sa Ket. Although the temple itself is in Cambodia territory, it isonly accessible from the Thai side through Ph Mo I-Daeng. The Fine Arts Department of Thailand registered Khao Phra Viharn as a historical site in 1962. In the same year, the strategic location of this majestic monument stirred up a bitter dispute between Thailand and Cambodia. Both claimed that this temple was on their territory. The conflict was brought to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favor of Cambodia. Preah Vihear Temple was opened and closed several times in the past because of fighting in Cambodia. The agreement on the joint development of this temple is considered a significant step to help build a solid foundation for promoting bilateral relations and long-lasting friendship, based on mutual trust and benefit.

A border spat between Cambodia and Thailand has closed the famed Preah Vihear temple to tourism, an official said on May 16, 2005, while complaining about Thai troops in the area. The 1,000-year-old temple, which sits on an escarpment looking back over Cambodia, was ruled a part of Cambodia by the International Court of Justice in 1962 but is more easily approached from Thailand. Governor Preab Tan of northern Preah Vihear province told AFP that Thailand had suddenly closed its checkpoint on Friday, "so then on the 13th I ordered the border closed on our side." He said Thailand, with whom Cambodia has had testy historical relations, had deployed at least 400 troops along the border and that landmine clearance was being carried out in a still-disputed zone around the temple. "We are demanding that they withdraw their troops back... They are installing tents, living quarters and weapons targeting Cambodia with no respite," he said. A Thai army officer in the Suranaree task force, which patrols the area, said other border checkpoints in the region remained open although Cambodia had closed its gates to the temple, and claimed Cambodia was breaching a 2000 agreement not to construct anything in the disputed zone. "Thai troops have been standing by (at normal level) near the border at Preah Vihear temple since last Wednesday to protest against Cambodian construction near the border," he told AFP. "The stand-by has caused Cambodia to lock the gates heading to Preah Vihear temple since Saturday. Thailand still has its gates open." The spat comes days after a new national border council, headed by former King Norodom Sihanouk, met for the first time aiming to thrash out issues of encroachment in the impoverished Southeast Asian kingdom.

Cambodia on June 13, 2005, re-opened access route to the landmark Preah Vihear temple, after it was closed since May 11, The Nation reports. "The closure is a result of minor misunderstanding," Preap Tanh, a Cambodia's senior official, said. He welcomed and held talks with Thai delegations including Sri Sa Ket governor Thanom Songserm on the Preah Vihear yesterday morning. After the talks, he said Preah Vihear was now open to tourists as usual and Cambodia would guarantee the safety of all tourists. Tanh also vowed to address the problems in which Cambodian settlements along the way to Preah Vihear Temple had released waste down the mountain slope and ended up in Thailand. The closure of the access route to the mountaintop temple started when Cambodian authorities have complained about the presence of Thai troops at the temple. Thailand had explained that the troops had been sent to prevent any further intrusion by Cambodian vendors Preah Vihear, technically located in the northernmost tip of Cambodia but only easily accessible from northeast Thailand. The ownership of Preah Vihear temple was disputed by Thailand and Cambodia and the International Court of Justice awarded it to Cambodia in 1962.

Thailand and Cambodia are set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on information and broadcasting to help promote relations and between the two countries. Both countries are expected to sign the MOU at the Fifth Meeting of the Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation later this month after it was approved by Thailand's cabinet last week, the Thai government said in a statement on October 17, 2005. According to the MOU, Thailand and Cambodia will exchange radio and television programs, news, and information. They will cooperate in radio and television program production and exchange knowledge and experience in information and communication technology, study tours, visits, training, and research, the government said. In addition to signing the MOU at the meeting, which will take place in Siem Riep, Cambodia, on October 19-20, 2005, the two countries will also review the progress of bilateral relations and explore new areas of cooperation. On the agenda is the issue of demarcation, cooperation in landmine clearing, projects under the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS), and the contract-farming program, the government said. They will also discuss the purchase of agricultural products, account trade, and the establishment of a one-stop service center to facilitate their cooperation in trade, energy development, land transport networks, investment, tourism, and education.

On February 24, 2006, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to draw up a Strategic Road Map for Enhanced Economic Partnership to boost cooperation between the two countries. Commerce Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said the plan would cover three sectors: trade, investment and tourism. The plan aims to double the number of tourists by 2008. The Thailand-Cambodia Joint Trade Committee meeting was held last week in Phnom Penh, during which several agreements and memoranda of understanding were signed. Somkid said that Thailand would provide assistance to Cambodia in terms of human-resource development and training programs, as well as passing on details of its One Tambon One Product scheme in a bid to help Cambodia develop a similar project. The minister said the government would also encourage investors and traders to set up manufacturing bases in Cambodia. The country's natural resources and labor force could support Thai businesses involved in energy, telecommunications, agriculture, fisheries, textiles and furniture, he added. The two countries should also focus on creating package tours to historic places to generate more foreign-exchange income, Somkid said. Cambodia has already set up special economic zones in provinces along its border with Thailand and offers one-stop services to help Thai traders take advantage of the system of preferences developed countries have granted to Cambodia.

MID2624 or the Koh Kon Island dispute occurred from the end of December 1964 until the beginning of January 1965. Thai Interior Undersecretary Phuang Suwannarat charged January 5 that 15 Cambodian soldiers had crossed into Thai territorial waters in a patrol vessel December 27, 1964, had seized a Thai fishing boat and had killed 4 of the 5 Thai crewmen. The fifth was drowned in the fight. Thailand filed a complaint with the UN, and Cambodia denied the charge January 8.
