CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1039 from cm002652v11.0 narrative, this is a multilateral MID involving Jordan, US, and UK vs. Egypt and Syria. Jordan began to crack down on the PLO in the 1970s because the PLO had been attacking Israel from Jordanian territory, causing tension between Jordan and Israel that Jordan did not want. In response, the PLO attempted to depose the king in a civil war. Syria intervened and provided support on behalf of the militarized anti-regime rebels, and the US and UK supported the Jordanian regime. Coded civil war link because the civil war in Jordan, outside of this dyad, contributed to a MID between UK and Syria here.

CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID3179 from NYT 4/7/1976, UK protested when a Syrian ship fired at and hit a UK shipping vessel in Lebanese waters. This was during the Lebanese Civil War, in which Syria was supporting the Lebanese government (Sorby 2011). Coded not civil war link because, although this occurred during the ciivl war in Lebanon (outside of this dyad), there is no indication that this was connected to the civil war. The UK was not participating or supporting anyone in the Lebanese Civil War, and the attacked ship cannot be connected to supplying warring parties.
