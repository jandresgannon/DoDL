TERRLINK-NOTES: MID2734 from MID-B data, this MID has date range 8/10/1987-2/4/1988. From Gibler, Miller, and Little (2016), Iran attacked a Panama-owned oil tanker in the Persian Gulf. Coded territorial link because this is connected to the Iran-Iraq War, a territorial dispute in which Iraq invaded Iran across their disputed border. Iran and Iraq regularly attacked ships trading with the other during the war.
