MID1272

TERRMID: MID1272 3 -- not territory
TERRMID-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: 

TERRLINK: MID1272 1 -- third party link to territorial MID
TERRLINK-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain
TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1272 from Gibler (2018), Poland wished to unify with Lithuania after WWI, but Lithuania did not want to do so. Poland tried to unify them by force and began occupying parts of Lithuania. This MID features many clashes and shows of force between Poland and Lithuania. Eventually, in 1922, Poland successfully annexed Lithuania until WWII. Coded third party link to territorial MID because this was centered on Poland's claim on Lithuania, and Latvia is pulled in by its military support for Lithuania. Latvia provided military support to Lithuania (and vice versa) on several occasions after WWI, especially against Soviets and others who made claims on their territory.

CIVWARMID-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain
CIVWARMID-NOTES: 

CIVWARLINK: MID1272 1 -- civil war link
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1272 Gibler (2018) describes an attempted coup in Lithuania by a Polsih cell, but according to our coding scheme, this was a militarized rebel group and not a coup, since no military or government personnel were involved in the plot. The Lithuanian government discovered the small group of conspirators who were militarized and armed. Coded civil war link because the rebel group was in Lithuania (outside of this dyad) and were planning to overthrow the government and unify with Poland.

COUPMID-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain 
COUPMID-NOTES: 

COUPLINK: MID1272 3 -- not coup link
COUPLINK-CER: MID1272 1 -- certain 
COUPLINK-NOTES: MID1272 Gibler (2018) describes an attempted coup in Lithuania in 1919, but this was not a coup by our coding scheme, as there were no military or government personnel involved.
