CIVWARLINK: MID1353 1 -- civil war link 
CIVWARLINK-CER: MID1353 1 -- certain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID1353 from cm002710 narrative, this is related to the Laotian Civil War that takes place from 1963 to 1973. N Vietnam directly supported the Pathet Lao communist insurgency, and the UK supported the Royal Laotian Government (RLG) forces. The opposing military support triggers this MID. Coded civil war link because the civil war in Laos is outside of this dyad and led to this MID.
