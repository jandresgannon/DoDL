CIVWARMID-NOTES: MID1114 from NYT 6/11/1959, Dominican Republic had officially protested earlier in the month that Venezuela was attempting to foment rebellion in DR. A civil conflict in DR was already ongoing, and DR accused both Venezuela and Cuba of plotting an invasion of its territory to overthrow the DR government. Coded civil war MID because this MID was connected to civil conflict in DR, which featured rebels who were militarized and fighting against the Dominican Republic government (within this dyad). The rebellion in Dominican Republic was militarized, rather than one of domestic protests/general unrest, as noted in the NYT 6/28/1959 and 7/5/1959. On 6/28/1959, the NYT describes an incident in which the DR dictator sent an undercover agent to join a rebel group made up of Dominican exiles hiding out in Puerto Rico who were preparing an invasion. On 7/5/1959, the NYT wrote about the state of the DR and the security of the regime in the midst of a coming revolution, and noted that the DR's biggest threat was invasion from Dominican exiles, who were banded together in rebel groups and seeking refuge in neighboring countries.
