TERRMID-NOTES: MID1717 from Gibler 2017, this is connected to the Gibraltar dispute between UK and Spain. In 1969, Spain closed its road and ferry into Gibraltar, which was vital for residents of Gibraltar to leave and enter the territory. UK announced military exercises in response, and Spain deployed planes and ships to the area. Spain later fired warning shots near a UK vessel. Coded territorial MID because Gibraltar was an active territorial dispute and was at the center of this MID.

NARRATIVE-CM:
The territory of Gibraltar, located at the southern tip of Spain, was ceded to Britain by Spain after the signing of the *Treaty of Utrecht* which ended the War of Spanish Succession in 1713. Spain disputed Britain's sovereignty over the territory Gibraltar beginning in January 1954. Spain closed its consulate in Gibraltar in May 1954. Spain referred the dispute to the *United Nations *(UN) General Assembly committee on decolonization in September 1963. The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on December 16, 1965 calling on the parties to begin negotiations regarding the dispute. Spain and Britain held negotiations in London from May 18 to October 11, 1966, when Britain proposed that the dispute be submitted to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ). Spain rejected the British proposal on December 14, 1966. Meanwhile, Spain had banned vehicular traffic in and out of Gibraltar on October 24, 1966, and citizens of Gibraltar were effectively banned from entering Spain on November 12, 1966. The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on December 20, 1966 calling on Britain and Spain to continue bilateral negotiations. On April 12, 1967, the Spanish government banned foreign civilian and military aircraft over Spanish territory and territorial waters beginning on May 15, 1967. Britain referred the Spanish airspace prohibition to UN Secretary-General U Thant on May 24, 1967. British and Spanish representatives held negotiations in Madrid on June 5-8, 1967. Britain announced on June 14, 1967 that it would hold a referendum in Gibraltar on the issue of its status. Spain protested the referendum decision on July 3, 1967, and complained to the UN General Assembly on August 18, 1967 that the referendum was a violation of UN resolutions and the *Treaty of Utrecht*. The referendum was held on September 10, 1967. The *Commonwealth of Nations* (CON) sent a four-member election observation mission headed by R. L. Hutchens of New Zealand to monitor the referendum beginning on August 31, 1967. More than 99 percent of the citizens of Gibraltar voted to remain a British colony. The CON mission reported that the referendum had been conducted in a "fair and proper manner" on October 6, 1967. The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on December 19, 1967 disapproving of the referendum and urging Spain and Britain to resume negotiations. Britain and Spain held bilateral negotiations in Madrid on March 18-20, 1968. Spain announced further restrictions on pedestrian travel between Spain and Gibraltar on May 4, 1968 (only Spanish citizens holding work permits would be allowed to cross into Gibraltar from Spain). The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on December 18, 1968 that called upon Britain to terminate the colonial situation in Gibraltar no later than October 1, 1969. Britain issued a new constitution for Gibraltar on May 30, 1969, providing for an elected House of Assembly to internally govern the territory. Spain responded to the new constitution by closing the border with Gibraltar on June 9, 1969, and cutting telephone service to the territory on October 1, 1969. Tensions between the countries were increased when Spain deployed six warships off the coast of Gibraltar on September 29, 1969, resulting in the deployment of ten British warships in the Gibraltar area. Britain issued a formal protest to the Spanish government on October 2, 1969 for cutting telephone lines to Gibraltar. Spanish warships withdrew from the Gibraltar area on October 9, 1969. British and Spanish representatives held bilateral negotiations on May 8-9, 1973. The UN General Assembly approved a resolution on December 14, 1973 once again calling for the resumption of negotiations between the countries. Britain and Spain resumed bilateral negotiations on May 30, 1974, and the countries agreed in principle in Lisbon on April 10, 1980 that border and telephones restrictions should be suspended. The Falklands War in 1982 resulted in the postponement of the Lisbon agreement, but the border between Spain and Gibraltar was finally reopened on February 5, 1985. British and Spanish foreign ministers held negotiations in Madrid on December 5-6, 1985. Spanish helicopters and a warship violated Gibraltar's territorial waters and airspace on March 20-21, 1986. British and Spanish foreign ministers met in London on January 13-14, 1987. British and Spanish representatives held negotiations in Madrid and London from November 25 to December 2, 1987, when the countries signed an agreement regarding the Gibraltar airport. The Gibraltar House of Assembly rejected the airport agreement on December 17, 1987.
