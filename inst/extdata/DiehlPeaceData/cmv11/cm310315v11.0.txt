TERRLINK-NOTES: MID1265 from (Gibler 2018), after WWI, several countries, including Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, pressed territorial claims against Hungary, recently broken away from Austria-Hungary. Here, Romania attacked Hungary to claim territory from Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, as part of the Allies, alowed this to happen and facilitated the Hungarian surrender of territory to Romania. Coded third party link to territorial MID because Romania and Hungary had a territorial dispute which Czechoslovakia became involved in here.

TERRLINK-NOTES: from Gibler (2018), Czechoslovakia threatened to walk out of the World Communist meeting in Budapest in 1968 if Russia did not stop interfering in Czech international affairs. Czechoslovakia's leader had been embracing a more international position, which worried communists in the Soviet Union and in other Soviet-controlled/allied states. The Soviets had been supporting the opposition political party in Czechoslovakia who held a more hard-line, pro-Soviet stance. In June 1968, the opposition party lost in the parliamentary elections, and Soviet tanks, joined by Hungarian, Polish, East German, and Bulgarian forces, arrived in Czechoslovakia and soon thereafter detained the Czech leader. In November, the Soviets forced Czechoslovakia to reorganize their regime and become more closely aligned with Soviet communism. Coded not third party link to territory because althuogh this MID involved Soviet/Hungarian/Bulgarian/East German/Polish occupation of Czechoslovakia, this was a regime type issue, not a territorial issue, as the Soviets were ensuring a friendly regime remained in place.

Czechoslovakia and Hungary established a mixed boundary commission, which completed demarcation of the border, except the Salgo-Tarjan district, on October 28, 1922. Hungary referred the Salgo-Tarjan dispute to the *League of Nations* (LON) Council on November 16, 1922. Czechoslovakia and Hungary agreed to submit the dispute to the LON Council for arbitration on January 31, 1923. The LON Council completed arbitration of the Salgo-Tarjan dispute on April 23, 1923. Hungary claimed territory in Czechoslovakia beginning on September 22, 1938.

Czechoslovakia agreed to submit the dispute to German and Italian arbitration on October 26, 1938. Germany and Italy formally agreed to arbitrate the dispute on October 31, 1938.

Czechoslovakia (Slovakia) and Hungary disputed the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam project when Hungary unilaterally suspended the joint project in 1989 (the countries agreed to the project in 1977). Hungary formally terminated the 1977 agreement in May 1992. Slovakia requested that Hungary abide by its obligations under the 1977 agreement, but Hungary argued that the dam project would be harmful to its environment and would adversely affect Budapest's water supply. Hungary and Slovakia submitted the dispute to the *International Court of Justice* (ICJ) in July 1993. The ICJ issued a decision on September 25, 1997, which suggested that the countries "must negotiate in good faith in the light of the prevailing situation" and take "all necessary measures to ensure the objectives" of the 1977 agreement. The Netherlands offered to mediate a resolution of the dispute on October 9, 1997.

19181016-19190623 .00 
The Hungarian–Czechoslovak War was fought between the First Hungarian Republic and the First Czechoslovak Republic beginning in November 1918. The main military actions were starting in April and ending in August 1919, during the existence and the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. At the end of 1918, the final year of World War I, the collapse of Austria-Hungary led to the declaration of the formed Czechoslovakia. The Czechs and Slovaks wanted to ensure the success of their territorial demands and started a counterattack. During the war, the Hungarian red army fought separate battles against troops from Czechoslovakia and Romania, while France was also highly involved[1] diplomatically in the conflicts, too. By its final stage, more than 120,000 troops on both sides were involved. Appealing to Hungarians with promises of regaining the land lost until then to neighboring countries within a week of his rise to power, Kun declared war upon Czechoslovakia as Hungarian forces invaded the former province of Slovakia on May 20, capturing southern Slovakia within weeks. In the face of advancing Hungarian troops, the Allies began to put pressure on the Hungarian government and, within three weeks with Kun's assurances of Russian support failing to materialize, Hungary was forced to withdraw from Slovakia after given an ultimatum from France together with a guarantee that Romanian forces would retreat from Tiszántúl.
