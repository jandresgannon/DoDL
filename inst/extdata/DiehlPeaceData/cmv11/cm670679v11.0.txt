Yemen and Saudi Arabia have had problems with their border for many years (Mideast Mirror. Dec. 9, 1997, Section: Saudia Arabia, Yemen, Vol. 11, No. 239 refers to this as Yemen's "decades-old border dispute with Saudi Arabia"). In 1995, they signed an agreement in which Yemen gave up its claims to three border provinces: Aassir, Najfan and Jizan. But there were other areas in dispute. Information about actions on the borders is vague. SAU would like to have a corridor to the Arabian Sea, and this would have to go through territory of Yemen and/or Oman. As well, some of the areas in dispute are "believed to be rich in oil deposits" (Agence France Press, Dec. 08. 1997, International News). There are a number of confrontations between these two countries about disputed territory. In most cases, SAU takes the initiative on these matters. Note: MID203 now includes incidents from MID204. Ric Stoll 7/23/02. NARRATIVE SOURCES Agence France Presse October 21, 1997 21:15 GMT International news. First day of dispute was on 6/00/1997 and last day of dispute aw son 7/19/1998.
