CIVWARLINK-CER: MID4017 3 -- uncertain 
CIVWARLINK-NOTES: MID4017 from Gibler, Miller, and Little 2016, this is a buildup of Italian troops on the Slovenian border. Italy claimed that Serbia would retaliate against NATO interveners who intervened in Bosnia. However, this did not escalate to a border fortification and was not directed at Slovenia. Coded uncertain because GML argue this case should be dropped. Coded civil war link because this was connected to fighting in Bosnia, outside of this dyad, which involved militarized rebels organized along ethnic lines.

Italy sent troops to its border with Slovenia. This border area had been used to smuggle arms, explosives and people across. The Italian government had uncovered evidence that there were links between Italian organized crime and the flow of weapons to Bosnia. But the immediate concern of the Italian government was that Bosnian Serb leaders had threatened retaliation against any country involved in NATO air strikes. Source: The New York Times.
