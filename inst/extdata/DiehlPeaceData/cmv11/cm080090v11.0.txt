PS-UPDATE2020: Remains a lesser rivalry, given: •In 2016, there was a Belize-Guatemala border standoff: began when Belizean solviers fatally shot a 13-year-old (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36114383; https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/guatemalan-troops-mass-belize-border-shooting-incident ) o	As a result, Guatemala deployed 3,000 troops on the border as a preventative measure o	Guatemala also recalled its amabassador to Belize in wake of this shooting (https://www.sanpedrosun.com/government/2016/06/02/belizeans-detained-in-guatemala-for-illegal-entry/) •	There has been an ongoing border dispute for decades, and in 2018 and 2019, both countries voted in favor of resolving this dispute with the ICJ (see: https://www.oas.org/es/sap/dsdme/pubs/role_of_the_oas_belize_guatemala.pdf and https://www.oas.org/sap/peacefund/belizeandguatemala/content4.html) •	ICJ extended due dates for briefs from both countries due to COVID-19, with Guatemala’s due on December 8, 2020 and Belize’s due on June 8, 2022 (https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/177/177-20200424-PRE-01-00-EN.pdf)

MID4014 

TERRMID: MID4014 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID4014 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4014 from cm narrative, Belize and Guatemala had settled a territorial dispute in 1991, but this dispute was reignited when the British announced in May 1993 that they would close their last military base in Belize. On July 20, 1993, Belize's Esquivel government suspended a territorial accord that had been signed by his predecessor before it was formally ratified, claiming that the previous government had made too many concessions. Guatemalan citizens claimed Belize soldiers entered the disputed territory and destroyed crops, while Belize claimed the soldiers were operating in their own territory. Coded territorial MID because the renewed territorial dispute led to a MID here. Because ratification did not occur, Owsiak would also code this as unsettled border. Occurred 10/15/1993-10/16/1993.

TERRMID-NOTES: MID4015 from cm narrative, this is another MID connected to a territorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize. In a series of incidents from 8/25/1995-9/23/1995, Guatemalan and Belize soldiers entered the disputed territory. Guatemala organized local farmers and villagers to monitor Belize soldiers' activity, and Belize entered the disputed territory to threaten the locals.

TERRMID-CER: MID4150 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4150 from cm narrative, this is another series of soldiers from Belize and Guatemala entering disputed territory, triggering this MID. From 8/1997-8/26/1997, Belizean soldiers crossed into Guatemala, destroyed crops, and threatened the locals with eviction. Belizean soldiers seemed to routinely destroy crops in the disputed area to coerce locals to move from the territory. In response, Guatemala ordered troops to the disputed border. Coded territorial MID because the events of this MID are connected to the disputed territory.

TERRMID: MID4151 1 -- territorial MID
TERRMID-CER: MID4151 1 -- certain 
TERRMID-NOTES: MID4151 from cm narrative, this is another MID triggered by the disputed territory between Belize and Guatemala. On 2/24/2000, 25 Guatemalan soldiers detained three Belizean soldiers and a policeman. Each country claimed that the incident took place in its own territory. Even though the Belizans were released by the Guatemalan Supreme Court, the incident led to the cancellation of border talks that had been scheduled to start in Miami on March 4. Belize also started military maneuvers near the border, drawing two Guatemalan protests (March 8 and 11) and leading to the Belizean Ambassador's eviction from Guatemala on March 8.

Guatemala announced that they were watching Belizean activities and that they would not be provoked. Belize later demanded many families in Guatemala leave the disputed territory. On May 13, 2001, 30 Belizean soldiers harassed and then expelled at least 15 Guatemalan families from a village in the "buffer zone" on the disputed border. Occurred 12/28/2001-5/13/2001.

Guatemala had long claimed the British colony of British Honduras (Belize) to be Guatemalan territory. This claim had become less intense over time, and Guatemala recognized Belize's independence in 1991 (ten years after the fact). The claim returned to prominence, though, following Great Britain's May 1993 announcement that it would close its last military base in Belize and remove its 1,500 soldiers. On July 20, 1993 Belize's Esquivel government suspended a territorial accord that had been signed by his predecessor before it was formally ratified, claiming that the previous government had made too many concessions. Guatemalan residents along the border with Belize claimed that on October 15th Belizean soldiers made an incursion to Guatemala and destroyed $60,000 worth of corn and rice crops. Belize claimed that the soldiers were operating on Belizean soil; neither side's story was immediately confirmed. As a response, on October 16th, the Guatemalan government dispatched 60 soldiers to the disputed border. No further incidents occurred in the immediate aftermath of the incursion. On March 31, 1994, Guatemala reasserted its claim on Belizean territory. By the end of 1994, both countries announced that they were ready to renegotiate. First day of dispute was on 10/15/1993 and last day of dispute was on 10/16/1993.

Guatemala has continued to claim Belize's territory even after recognized Belize's independence in 1991 (ten years after the fact). Since 1991, Guatemala has been calling for a negotiated settlement for the access they want to the Caribbean. According to Guatemalan media, Belizean soldiers crossed the border to Guatemala on August 25, 1995 in the northern El Peten department. They threatened to destroy crops and evict peasant farmers in the hamlet of Monte de Olivos. Later, sometime around September 9 or 10, 1995, another incursion occurred. This time Guatemalan government said that Belizean soldiers entered Guatemala near the village of Los Olivos. Belizean troops burned a dwelling, destroyed some crops, and "terrified" farmers. As a result, on September 11, 1995 Guatemalan government asked Belize to exercise the "utmost caution" at the common border to avoid further incidents. Following two incidents on their border with Belize, Guatemala sent elite soldiers to the disputed border and organized local farmers to monitor the area. Officials said the moves were made to "guard against a new incursion," a preventive measure to protect Guatemalan farmers against actions by the Belizean army.

In the ongoing territorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize tensions rose in August 1997. In one of several occasions where Belizean soldiers crossed the border to Guatemala, near the villages Sarstun and El Carrizal, Belizean soldiers supposedly entered Guatemala. Farmers accused Belizean soldiers of destroying crops that they claimed were planted in Belizean territory. Some Guatemalans also claimed that they were threatened with eviction from the land. Following these incursions, on August 26, 1997, claiming that Belizean movements "injured Guatemalan sovereignty" Guatemala's president ordered troops to the border. Following these moves, officials agreed to meet in September to discuss the issue. It was not clear if the meeting took place. First day of dispute was on 8/00/1997 and last day of dispute was on 8/26/1997.

Guatemala has been seeking the return of 12,272 square kilometers of land from Belize (more than half of Belize's land mass) since that country's independence in 1981. On February 24, 2000, as part of this ongoing territorial claim, 25 Guatemalan soldiers detained three Belizean soldiers and a policeman. Each country claimed that the incident took place in its own territory. According to Guatemalan officials, the Belizeans were captured outside the municipality of San Fransisco in the northern Guatemalan city of Peten. The incident was seen as a retaliation for Belizean soldiers' shooting of a Guatemalan farmer in December 1999 (some sources say January 2000). Even though the Belizeans were released by the Guatemalan Supreme Court, the incident led to the cancellation of border talks that had been scheduled to start in Miami on March 4. Belize also started military maneuvers near the border, drawing two Guatemalan protests (March 8 and 11) and leading to the Belizean Ambassador's eviction from Guatemala on March 8. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Orellana said Belize was "playing with fire," and indicated that Guatemala considered the troop movements as provocation. Guatemalan officials also emphasized that they would not respond militarily and preferred a diplomatic solution. As a response to the Belizean maneuvers, the Guatemalan government announced that starting on March 17, 2000, they increased their surveillance patrols on the border. They brought the garrison in the area from 300 to 350 in order to prevent any further incidents; the increase lasted at least through mid-April, which is the time of the last report on this subject. First day of dispute was on 2/24/2000 and last day of dispute was on 4/00/2000.

NO MILITARIZED ACTION 

On the disputed border between Guatemala and Belize, tensions rose following an incursion by Belizean soldiers to the one kilometer "proximity zone" that had been set up om each side of the border with OAS assistance. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Orellana announced that on December 28 and 29, 2000, Belizean soldiers violated the "proximity zone" and placed boundary markers near the Guatemalan regions of Santa Cruz Rio Blanco and Peten. Guatemala announced that they were watching Belizean activities and that they would not be provoked. The tension was eased in early January, 2001, when Belize called off the eviction of 221 Guatemalans settled on the disputed territory. Earlier Belize had claimed that these families were settled one mile inside Belizean territory. Later in February the Belizean government changed its mind about these families and re-ordered them to leave because they were in a protected ecological area. Following a round of negotiations at Barbados, Belizean Prime Minister Said Musa announced that even though he was hopeful that some progress in the dispute would be achieved, he did not think that an "amicable settlement" would be reached in the short run. Nonetheless, on May 13, 2001, 30 Belizean soldiers harassed and then expelled at least 15 Guatemalan families from a village in the "buffer zone" on the disputed border. Tensions remained after this incident, but Guatemala and Belize continued to hold peace talks over the larger territorial question between them with OAS mediation. First day of dispute was on 12/28/2001 and last day of dispute was on 5/13/2001.

NARRATIVE-CR:

The new rivalry between Guatemala and Belize began in 1993 and involves territorial claims by both sides along their common border. Guatemala has a 150 year-old claim to Belize despite its gaining independence from Great Britain in 1981. In 1991, Guatemala officially recognized Belize, establishing diplomatic relations under the government of Jorge Serrano. The decision was not popular in Guatemala, with the Guatemalan constitutional court maintaining that the dispute in 1991 was not settled. Indeed in 1993, Guatemala revived the territorial claims with the ouster of President Serrano. Since this period, Guatemala has tried to revive its claims in the international community while also trying to stop incursions by the Belizean military into its territory.

Belizean troops crossed the border of Guatemala in the Melchor de Mencos region on October, 15, 1993, destroying rice and corn crops, MID4014. The action was justified by the claim that the crops were in Belizean territory. On October 19, 1993, Belize denied the accusations. Subsequently, Guatemalan ambassador to Belize, Antonio Castellanos suggested that such incursions were not accurate as reported by Guatemalan newspapers. On October 20, 1993, Guatemala mobilized 60 soldiers on its border with Belize. 

On August 27, 1995 Belizean troops were accused of crossing the border into Guatemala, MID4015. On September 11, 1995 Guatemala moved troops to its border with Belize. Foreign Minister Alejandro Maldonado claimed that while the two countries had no formal agreement demarcating the border, Belizean incursion was still unjustified. On September 14, 1995 Guatemala ordered its ambassador to return from Belize for consultation. 

On August 17, 1997 Belize again was accused of incursions across the Guatemalan border, purposefully destroying crops, MID4150. On August 26, 1997 Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu ordered increased border patrols along the border. 

On February 24, 2000 Guatemala arrested three Belizean soldiers and a police officer for crossing the border illegally MID4151. Guatemala additionally sent 300 troops to the border. On February 25, Belizean and Guatemalan officials suspended a meeting in Miami to discuss the border issue. On December 28, 2000, Belizean troops again crossed the border into Guatemala MID4152. On January 6, 2001 the Organization of American States urged the two countries to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the border issue on January 16. In January 2001, the two sides established a peace zone to build confidence and reduce tensions along the border. Belizean officials claimed the Guatemalans had violated the zone during the emergency meeting. On January 18, 2001 Guatemalan and Belizean officials signed a plan to reduce tension on the border. 

While 2001 marks the last militarized dispute between the two countries, it is clear that this new rivalry is far from concluded. Steps have been taken to resolve the border issue peacefully, however, with the involvement of the OAS helping to facilitate that process. On February 7, 2003 the two countries signed an agreement to create a transition process and confidence-building measures to resolve the dispute. The OAS provided good offices for the brokering of this agreement. On February 27, 2003 the OAS began efforts to establish an office along the border to monitor the confidence-building measures and any transgression of territory. 

The assistant secretary-general of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luigi Einaudi, visited Belize and Guatemala in July 2004, in an attempt to re-start negotiations over the disputed border. Confidence-building measures are being implemented, including regular meetings between the Belize defense force and the Guatemalan army. A cross-border health commission was established in September 2004 and twice-weekly direct flights between Belize City and Guatemala City began in October 2004. The Belizean Prime-Minister has suggested referring the border dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.

A partial scope trade agreement with Guatemala was signed on August 31st 2005, allowing for duty-free trade on a restricted list of products, with clauses covering transportation and the protection of investment. The agreement has enabled Citrus Products of Belize, an export company, to sell Belize fruit juice to Central American markets. Some Guatemalan manufacturers will also now be able to invest in Belize, in order to gain access to Caribbean Community (Caricom) markets. Proposals from 2002 made by the Organization of American States (OAS), the appointed conciliator, were officially shelved on September 7th 2005. Belize has accepted that it would be politically impossible for a Guatemalan government to recognize the existing border. Under an Agreement on a Framework for Negotiations and Confidence Building Measures, a joint commission will continue to encourage initiatives in trade, tourism and resource conservation. Talks have not ended, however, and starting from October 31st 2005, there will be regular bilateral meetings-at least every 45 days-in the presence of an OAS facilitator. If talks fail to reach a resolution then the matter will be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The relations between the two countries have also been tainted by Guatemala's leading role in campaigning within the WTO against privileged EU market access for Caribbean bananas.

Belize became independent on September 21, 1981. The border dispute between Belize and Guatemala has more than a 150 years of history and was inherited by Belize from its colonial power, the United Kingdom. In 1982 General Rios Montt who became the head of state in Guatemala following a coup made it clear that Guatemala did not recognize Belize as an independent country. In October 1982 negotiations between the two parties with UK attending them, were re-launched. In January 1983, President Montt stated that Guatemala did not extend a claim to all the Belize, but just to the southern district of Toledo. The government of Belize stated that even though they are willing to discuss revisions of the maritime boundary between the two countries, as well as a proposal for joint development of the southern land border, no cessation of land territory will take place. The Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs assured Belize that Guatemala will not resort to force in order to address this problem. Fresh negotiations were held in 1984 and 1985, however Guatemala was adamant in not recognizing the independence of Belize, and insisted to negotiate with the British government. The climate improved in 1986 with the statement of the newly elected Guatemalan president, Cerezo, who intended to negotiate directly with the Belizean government. In May 1988 a Permanent Joint Commission was set up by Guatemala and Belize to prepare a comprehensive draft treaty. The agreement stated that the existing river and land boundaries of Belize are to be kept the same, the southern maritime border will be modified to allow Guatemala access to the Caribbean, and that some joint (offshore) development projects should be undertaken in the Belizean Exclusive Economic Zone. The heads of state of the two countries endorsed this treaty informally in July 1990. On 11 September 1991 the two states established diplomatic relations. Belizean troops crossed the border of Guatemala in the Melchor de Mencos region on 19931015, destroying rice and corn crops, MID4014. The action was justified by the claim that the crops were in Belizean territory.

Representatives of both countries met in Honduras at the Ministerial level under the "7th September 2005 Agreement on a Framework for Negotiations and Confidence Building Measures" to discuss their border problems. According to the statement, both parties have agreed to "establish a technical group of representatives of the three countries who, following the instructions of their respective Governments and in accordance with the Framework Agreement of 7 September 2005, will meet to deal with the following issues: base lines, territorial waters, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf". It said that the first meeting would be held in Belize on 20-21 April and that the next Ministerial meeting would be held in Honduras from 19-20 May, 2006. The meeting said that the meeting in Honduras on Thursday was held in a "cordial and constructive spirit" and that "for the first time in history, the representatives of the coastal states met to discuss the issues related to maritime jurisdiction in the Gulf of Honduras".

Belize and Guatemala have agreed to establish a working group to deal with a number of issues relating to their long-standing border dispute, according to an official statement issued in Belmopan on 24 March, 2006. 

On June 27, 2006, the two countries signed a historic trade agreement to increase trade between them. Guatemala's economy minister, Mario Ronaldo Cuevas Quezada, said he was positive that the agreement signaled a new era between the two countries. He said it would also lead to a "positive trade relationship that will strengthen our productive sectors". President of the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry Emile Mena said the agreement represents major opportunities for the private sector. "This partial scope agreement that is being signed is a huge, huge move between Belize and Guatemala to increase trade not only between both countries, but also between Central America and the Caribbean." "Guatemala is a country that has grown a lot. I think we need to look at the bigger picture, Central America and Guatemala." The signing ceremony was witnessed by Acting British High Commissioner David Spires, whose country has for several years been seeking to improve relations between the two countries. Spires described the agreement as "particularly pleasing", adding "as you know that we have been involved in confidence-building measures between the two countries". He said the measures were aimed at developing a commercial linkages programme which designed to encourage trading relations between Belize and Guatemala. "We see this as the fruition of that programme. I would just like to congratulate the two countries in coming together today to sign the agreement. I think it's a really good, positive step and we are just very pleased to have been a small part of this." "And in case you're worried that the agreement will be a Trojan Horse for Guatemala, don't be, as Courtenay (Belize foreign minister) says they've taken that into consideration," Spires said. Courtney said the agreement "recognizes the differences in size of the two economies, and therefore gives more benefit to Belize than it gives to Guatemala". "So as we open the doors for trade between the two countries, I think Guatemala understands that Belize is a small, a much smaller economy, a much smaller market and therefore we have asymmetric obligations and preferences in the agreement." He said the agreement would be taken to the parliament for approval. "That of course should not be any difficulty. Guatemala expects before the end of this year to be in a position to sign the instrument of ratification. They have to go to Congress and the executive, as they explained." The embassy of Guatemala, along with the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are hosting a three day trade mission here to capitalize on the signing of the Partial Scope Agreement.

On January 6, 2008, the Belize government says it has started the relocation of settlers to Guatemala from a border village 24 miles west of the Belize-Guatemala border. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the first eight families were relocated on Friday and the Organization of American States (OAS), which is coordinating the project, said that the remaining nine families would be relocated as soon as possible. The OAS said it intends to complete the entire relocation within the shortest possible time. The project includes the acquisition of land, the construction of the infrastructure which included access roads, installation of electricity as well as potable water and the construction of the houses, with funds from the international donor community. The Said Musa administration said that under the project, when each phase of the relocation process is concluded, the vacant structures within Santa Rosa would be dismantled permanently "and no one will be allowed to resettle in the area". Belize and Guatemala have a long standing border dispute and the OAS is among international organizations trying to find an amicable solution.

An official special agreement on submitting the issue to the ICJ was signed on 8 December 2008, with a referendum to be held on the issue simultaneously in Belize and Guatemala on a date to be determined. Not such referendum was held by 20110120. 

The President of the Guatemala Congress, Roberto Alejos, is scheduled to visit Belize later in March 2009 as the two countries make a new effort to resolve their longstanding territorial dispute. The two nations have so far agreed in principle to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice for arbitration, but before that, they will each subject the matter to a referendum. Alejos told reporters that during his visit to Belize on March 10, 2009, he will discuss with the Belizean authorities the arrangements for the poll. "The referendum must be simultaneous and the moment will depend on Belize because that country needs to call a Constituent Assembly to reform its Constitution and adopt what the Court has decided," Alejos said. Guatemala has a demand since 1890 on over 4.6 thousand square miles of territory from that former British colony, as well as several islands, islets and a maritime platform. The government of the neighboring country rejects any bid to cut its territorial integrity and demands total respect to sovereignty. The impossibility to solve the conflict bilaterally, after several years of unsuccessful meetings, influenced the parties to submit the case to the Hague jurisdiction. People from the two nations must respond 'yes' or 'no' about if they agree that the entity must determine legitimacy of the Guatemalan demand and define common borders once and for all.
